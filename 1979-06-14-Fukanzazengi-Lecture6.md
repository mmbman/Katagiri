... talked about zazen based on body and mind dropping off. Which means that from the first, dullness and distractions are struck aside, the moment you do zazen. This morning I would like to see this from a pretty different angle, that is sort of from the psychological point of view. You know if you are ... primitive Buddhist, there is the categories of existence, which is called five skandhas. Among the five skandhas, there is very interesting concept which is called samskara. In ... Sutra, it is translated as 'impulses'. According to ... it is regarded as "together-maker". That concept of samskara is very interesting, very interesting teaching. ... 

In the development of buddhism, this concept of samskara is divided into many. For instance, in Abhidharma-kosha, we learned this year already (in talk) given by Reb Anderson, that there are five psychological categories of existence. One is form elements, elements of form. That is the six organs, the six objects. The second one is six consciousnesses. The third category is called, what would you say, function, concomitant mental faculties. That means functions of mind; wholesome mind; wholesome functions and unwholesome functions; concomitant with six consciousness. So, many kinds of concomitant functions of the mind; for instance anger, hatred, et cetera; many things. 

(4:10) Fourth one is ... this is very interesting point, the categories. Because this is an element which is not associated with mind. Not associated with mind of the six consciousnesses or concomitant mental faculties, or the elements of form. The other on is - the truth. That is the element which is completely not associated with the truth, and also mind, and also form, and also the concomitant mental faculties. So that is what is called samskara.

(5:12) So in Abhidharma-kosha, samskara are divided into many things. But point is, that element, I am very interested in the element, which is not associated with mind, and not associated with truth. 

But is sort of form(?). Well according to the book, the concept of Buddhism, he said about this: "a force, it must be recalled, shouldn't be regarded as a real influence of something extending beyond its own existence in order to penetrate into another. But, simply as a condition or a factor, upon which another factor arises, or becomes a permanent by itself. This is samskara in the Buddhist system." So, samskara as a force shouldn't be regarded as mere influence of something extending beyond its own existence in order to penetrate into another. So samskara is not your ... penetrating into another. It is a condition, a kind of condition. A condition is a fact which occurs between two objects. But main... condition which is called origination and decay, according to primitive Buddhism, that is impermenance, or constant change. Appearing and disappearing, appearing and disappearing. But broadly speaking, force is understood like this. 

(8:04) Anyway, force is not a real force, but a condition. Conditioned element, which occurs between two objects. And also this conditioned element has a certain power to conserve two things. ... So that's why this author says, simply as a condition ... which another fact arises, or becomes prominent. Prominent by itself. This is samskara. 

For instance, yesterday I told you that story about Gensha Shibi. On the way ... he stumbled over, he struck his toes on a rock. Blood appeared, and he screamed, "Ouch!" And he had the question: "Body and mind do not exist. From where does this pain come?" So, he attained enlightenment from this point. He went back to his temple and practiced under Seppo Zen Master.

Well, let's recall this story. In rock, his toes, his body and mind, particularly his leg, and also his nails came out, by the hitting. But they are simple objects. Rock; his toes. Between his toes and rock, there is no action of human consciousness. If there is something, it is called form, which means conditioned element. Conditioned element which happens between two objects. Rock, and toes. Something happens. That is conditioned. Under the condition, the two objects are combined, unified, as just one. At that time, something happens; that is called event, fact. That's why this author say, ... another fact arises. There is a fact, which is called conditioned element between the two, and then, two things are unified perfectly. And then, something happens. This is another fact. 

So, this is called event. Occurrence. So from this point, conditioned elements are sort of a force. Actually not a force, but ...  but able to be combined or unified, perfectly. That means, in other words, when the toe, his toe, Gensha Shibi's toe, is used perfectly, fitting into another object which is called rock, at that time, it is called "something happens". And on the other hand, when the rock is completely used perfectly, fitting into toe, at that time, that is called an event. This is samskara. 

So what is samskara? Samskara "together-maker". "Together maker" means conditioned element. Conditioned elements are completely something which is not associated with your mind. But yesterday, or the day before yesterday, I told you mind is characterized by dichotomize. Charactized by dichotomy of two beings. But in the realm of, in the context of samskara, there is no mind which is associated with conditioned elements. No way; nothing. But, this conditioned elements are kind of force, which is called to combined, to unify two beings; object and subject. At that time, there is something that happens. So, in the process of combining and unifying two objects, there is no mind. It is perfect. Perfect. That's why there is no room to let human conscious speculation insert into it. Nothing. That's why, very naturally, all delusions, dullness and distraction, throw up. No dullness, no distraction, no confusion. Completely nothing. 

(14:52) And then, something happens. And when something happens, that is event or occurrence. At that time, mind associates with this event. That is .. after something. Mind associates with this occurrance which happened. And then it's okay; that is very naturally. Simultaneously, it happened. At that time, when the mind attached to event, this is called conditioned world, dualistic world. But when mind doesn't attach to this event, it turns into the truth. That is unconditioned world. That's why samskara is sort of a breach. Bridge. Take to completely dualistic world, or not dualistic world. That is completely bridge, or door.

Door is free, always free. No delusions, no confusion; always, door exists. So something happens. And at the moment that it happens, mind associates, and that task to do something, at that time, you can enter into dualistic world. But when mind doesn't attach there, immediately you can go there, go to the truth. But unfortunately, mind is always characterized by dichotomy, I told you. So, more or less, we immediately enter into the dualistic world. 

But the point is, it's not necessary to be confused. We have to awaken to the nature of the mind, as much as possible, as best as we can ... awaken to. What is the characteristic of mind? Mind is immediately associate with occurrence and attach to it. At that time, you can get into the gate of dualistic world. So you should awaken to it. If you awaken to it perfectly, through and through, that is very good chance to enter to ... 

How? We have to use our bodies and minds, must be used perfectly. For what? Zazen. Or for what? The rock. When your toe is completely used perfectly for rock, something happens. So in other words, we have to return to origin. Origin ...  That is, something happens. There is force between the two. So that's conditioned elements, is kind of a force. To .... Within this: no mind. Completely nothing. 

(19:16) But unfortunately we have a mind. We have a mind; so we cannot ignore the mind. We have to use the mind. 

That's why we have to use the mind. But first, we have to use our body. In other words, toe. Or, rock. Rock corresponds to zazen. Toes is your body. When your body is perfectly used for the rock or zazen, without mind associated with this condition - just a condition. Let's use body in zazen; let's use the body perfectly, fitting into zazen. At that time, something happens. That is called zazen. That is an occurrence we can see. Immediately mind attach it: "this is mine." This is too late. ... That is not real zazen; that is picture of zazen, image of zazen. We attached to it; and if we attached to it, your zazen is already in the dualistic world. It's not real zazen. 

(21:05) But if don't attach to it, if you don't attach to this event occurrence, your zazen turns into the gate to the truth, which is called unconditioned world. This is really beautiful zazen; blooms. 

I already told you a few stories so far; and Dogen says also here lots of examples, but he didn't explain completely about each stories. But the few stories I told you really ... implication of the meaning of shikantaza, zazen, based on body and mind dropping off. 

And then he says here, "In addition, the bringing about of enlightenment by the opportunity provided by a finger, a banner, a needle, or a mallet, and the effecting of realization with the aid of a hosu (whisk), a fist, a star, or a shout," - those things come from the old stories between the Zen masters and the Zen monks. You can see in this book in the note. But overall it's not Eihei Shingi, I don't have enough time to explain all things. That's why I told you a few stories; Gensha Shibi's, and one more thing I forgot. "... cannot be fully understood my man's discriminative thinking." You cannot understand why Gensha Shibi attained enlightenment by striking his toes, and by seeing the blood coming up. We don't understand why. The blood has mysterious power? I don't think so; blood is blood. His toes have particular mysterious powers? No. He didn't have telepathy. He didn't use telepathy, just rock. Rock is rock, has no mysterious power. Why (did) he attain enlightenment? [sound of police siren] Because I told you before, we are mind; something happens between rock, and toes, and Gensha Shibis, and the ??? - all are beings, which are not associated with mind. So everything exists, day after day, in the process of change. [still police siren] In the stream of change. Birds, zazen, and that siren, all things exist in peace and harmony, in the stream of change. And then, something happens, according to conditioned element, which happens between the two. That is, conditioned element [mercifully, the police siren finally stops. Waiting to hear if anybody gets arrested] is characterized by one object, one being, used perfectly for another being. Fitting into its object, perfectly. This is conditional element.

[25:44] For instance, siren (sound?) comes up. So your ears hear the sound outside. When your ears completely used perfectly, fitting into sound, at that time, you can hear. By what? Conditioned elements, what is called source(?), together-maker. That conditioned element - from where it comes? We don't know. It's there. Well according to Buddhist philosophy, that is called dependent origination. Or, change - constant change. ??? of the conditioned element, always. And the interdependence; always connected. 

The sound completely used for your ear, fitting into your ear perfectly. That is, at that time, well, your ear becomes one with sound. And then, something happens. That is sound. 

At that time, that is event. Then immediately, mind associates with this siren, or your ear. And then, that is a gate. Which would you like to go: this way, or that way? Very quick. And also, mind is very tricky. If you realize, "Hey, mind is very tricky," then you are already tricked. [laughter] You're already tricked. "I understand mind, how tricky mind is" - so you are already tricked your understanding of how tricky mind is. So always again and again, snowballing. First of all. Then finally, what you have to do is, stop it. Stop it. How can you stop it? You cannot stop your mind. So, first important thing: in order to stop your mind, first, your body must be used perfectly, fitting into your object. At that time very naturally, mind stops. Because, my body and breath becomes one with zazen. At that time, my body completely one with zazen. And then, problem is, mind associates with, and attaches to it; at that time, you cannot see the oneness. And then, the mind misunderstands oneness. For instance, oneness is just like the moon reflected in the water. So, combination of two things. But it is not one. Because, two different things exist. So it's not. 

So Dogen Zenji says in the Genjokoan... "Oneness is not like moon reflected in the water, water in which moon is reflected." So, what is oneness? Oneness is ... oneness appears. Oneness manifests itself, only when your body is perfectly used and fitting into your object. At that time, your body merges itself in zazen. So, your body doesn't appear. ??? Just zazen. When you see zazen, just zazen. When you see your body, just the body appears, and zazen doesn't appear. For instance, we don't understand yet, because there is the ??? There is ... lump of clay. However you use this clay, it depends on you. But let's imagine, we try to make a doll. Doll, or china, or plate - whatever it is. Let's make a plate. China dish. And also ... But when you use perfectly this clay, a lump of clay, fitting into dish - at that time, where is the clay? You cannot call it, "that is clay." You say, "dish." When you see the dish, on the other hand, completely clay is hidden behind dish. Perfect. But when you make the doll with this clay, you don't call that clay, you call "doll". Japanese doll, or American doll; you say so. But at that time, it doesn't appear, in the realm of the doll world. Completely hidden. But it's not disappeared; it's always there. But we don't say, always we see the doll. ... Just see the doll, that's enough. If so, ... clay is hidden behind doll. Support, great support. But you cannot say always, "that is a doll." No, no clay. You cannot say. 

On the other hand, turn over. If you see the doll in terms of the clay: just the clay. It's clay. Same clay with which you make dish and doll. So you say, "those clays same." So in terms of the clay, doll and plate are completely hidden, behind clay. Just the clay appears. That's why we are interested in the subject of what kind of clay you use ... You don't care the doll, you don't care the dish. Analyzing... because total picture of dish as a being possesses double face. But this double face is not combination of the two things. Just like the moon reflected in the water; it's not oneness. Oneness is, when you see the doll, just see the doll. At that time, clay doesn't appear. Dogen Zenji says, "When one is bright, the other one is dark." The other one is dark. "The other one is dark" doesn't mean the other one disappears. It can, but it doesn't ... one side... It's great support, which doesn't appear yet, on the surface of... world. 

(34:50) So, this is normal. Same applies to our zazen. First of all, mind is always associating with events, which is called practice of zazen. So at that time we attach to, your zazen becomes, you enter into dualistic zazen. At that time, zazen is used as a means. But when your mind doesn't attach to it, your zazen enters into the truth.

So how can you stop ... your mind? You cannot stop it. So ... let's return to origin, which is called ... world. What is called, elements not associated with mind and truth, completely ... Let's return to conditioned elements. What is how we can return to conditioned elements? Because I told you earlier, conditioned elements is characterized by unifying two beings, perfectly. That means, one object is used perfectly, fitting into its object. This is conditioned element. So, let's return to this. Using your body and breath, are used, perfectly, fitting into zazen. At that time, something happens. That is zazen as an event. 

So mind immediately catches it. That, "I got it." You catch it. The moment when you catch it, there is attachment. So, that's why regulation of the mind is important. That is, Dogen Zenji says, "Throw away good or bad, right and wrong. Have no designs on becoming a buddha." Through and through. Anyway, we have to practice of having no design of becoming buddha. No reward there. Just ... to conditioned element. Using your body sitting perfectly into object, zazen. At that time, your body becomes one naturally with zazen. So your body is made as zazen. That's all. 

(37:58) And then when we see just the zazen, it is zazen. It is just zazen. ... body is hidden behind zazen. But that body doesn't bother zazen. Just like a doll, and also ... 

But on the other hand, if you see that zazen from the back, which is called clay, or your body, breath and mind, at that time, body appears. But zazen is completely hidden behind. It doesn't bother you. Then at that time, mind, all delusions completely drop off. This is zazen; shikantaza. 

Shikantaza, based on dropping off body and mind, is not new idea mentioned Dogen. It's really Buddhism. Well, you can explain according to Buddhist psychology. But we don't understand real meaning of samskara, and also ... the elements which is not associated with mind. That's why we understand just as concept, apart from human life. That's why we don't understand. 

And also, one of the elements which are not associated with mind, is obtaining or getting. That is one of the conditioned elements. Between the two, there is conditioned element, which is called obtain, getting. In Sanskrit we say "prapti": to get, to obtain.

(40:40) ... There (are) three kinds of obtaining and getting. Obtaining is to obtain and complete something. That is ... characteristic of conditioned element: to get and complete. ... You should sew a seed of the truth. Even though your body and mind exist in the dualistic world, you can sew a seed. So seed is completely seed. 

And also, you can manifest your actions are actualized. In other words you can manifest your actions in your daily life. That is complete ... Even though you are in dualistic world, you can plant, you can complete. You can complete buddha's world right now, right here, and actualized in your daily living. This is the second obtaining and completion. 

And then, on the other hand, is seed. You don't actualize, but you can sew a seed. For instance, shikantaza, you don't... in the shikantaza, all delusions drop off and you don't understand. But, if you do zazen, anyway you can sew a seed, in your mind, in your life. But it doesn't appear. No. But, someday. If you do it, if you really do zazen, ... fitting into zazen, at that time it's actualization of zazen itself. So even though you don't understand, you gain something and complete something. As a truth. Even though you are dualistic world, you can do. 

(43:20) Problem is, you are completely not interested. Well, "Katagiri says zazen is important, so lets try to do zazen, you know ..." This is zazen. It doesn't appear; you can plant a seed. But someday, zazen will grow. So this is another opportunity, possibility. 

So three possibilities. On possibility is to plant a seed. Second possibility is to actualize, in order to complete in your daily living; you can do. And third possibility is, no (interest?). ... "I don't know." No spirit. No spirit of zazen. But, Katagiri says, let's do zazen,... just do zazen. 

But this is also pretty good. Because that is possibility which will bloom in the future. That is called completion of  liberation, freedom. Completion of freedom. In other words, you are free. No particular realm, good or bad or neutral. Your life is so-so. Are you happy? No. Are you unhappy? No. Are you neutral? No. Well, how do you feel? So-so. 

This is ... But still there is a past state. So that is one of the conditioned elements, which is called obtaining and getting. So between the two objects, zazen and you, there are three kinds of conditioned elements. Three kinds of conditioned elements means three kind of possiblity exist. You can plant a seed, right now, with your body, completely. According to instructions, you can plant seeds - even though you don't understand. Or, you can completely actualize, actualize completion. According to possession and instructions; you can find, you can realize. But if you actualize exactly, even though intellect cannot reach, it's really actualized. You cannot ... So, you can complete something in your daily living. 

But also between zazen and you there is another possibility. "Well, I don't understand." "Well, I don't want to do, but ..." 

Best way

[tape change]

[47:19] ... in ... conditioned elements. How? Using your body, perfectly fitting into your object. At that time, your body becomes one with zazen, zazen becomes one with you, very naturally. At that time, there is something happens. That is called zazen, zazen. The question is, mind attach to it. That's why Dogen Zenji says, lets practice regulation of the mind. No (de)sign of having reward. Very tricky mind, very monkey mind, always.

Well, we have to make every possible effort to do that. We have a mind. Mind is already here. That's why we have to practice. 

Dogen Zenji says, that's why, "cannot be fully known by the practicing or realizing of supernatural power either." Even though you can find there, you cannot understand this kind of zazen. Or, Dogen Zenji says, "It must be deportment beyond man's hearing and seeing." If you see zazen after your zazen, that is image of zazen. It is not real zazen. Deportment means, behavior, which is called zazen. .. We call Iji. I of Iji means "majestical and awe-inspiring". Majestic, very majestic. "Gi" of Igi means fitting into or mention of the truth. That is form, your behavior. That is deportment, here it says deportment, but originally we use igi. Usually we use 'behavior', but that behavior is 'igi' in Buddhism, because that behavior has sense of very majestic, and also sense of the awe ... Fitting into the ... of the truth. That is your behavior.

This behavior, which is called zazen, is completely beyond hearing or seeing, the six consciousnesses. Let's return to conditioned elements; that's all. But, Dogen Zenji says, "Is it not the principle that is prior to his knowledge and perception?" That is, that zazen, completely beyond hearing and seeing, is not mysterious thing. There is still ... being ... something of the knowledge and perception. Let's use your body and mind. Perfectly fitting into one object, called zazen. At that time, something happens. 

(51:41) After that, mind associates. That's all. Then mind says, "ahh, that's zazen." And then when you touch it. But before mind, prior to function of your mind, it's really that's it. It's very simple practice. That's why Dogen Zenji says, "is it not a principle that is prior to his knowledge and perceptions." It really fits into your knowledge and perceptions. 

(52:30) Do you have questions?

***Question***: Roshi? In ... buddhism, I remember ready in a couple places, where he talked about prapti, and not exactly opposite, but ... apropti, and he talked about prapti different than you. He called it a force that keeps positives together in one being. 

***Katagiri***: Positives, yes.

***same person***: And the aprapti is some force that keeps away. Could you say a little more about that?

***Katagiri***: Well that is, changing. Changing, stream of change, broadly speaking. So we analyze that function of change, dividing into several things. And then prapti and aprapti - these are categories, just categories. So that means, broadly speaking, there is some force to combine, to put together something, to separate, always. That means appearance, disappearance. 

***same person***: Could you develop a specific example, of ... something in everyday life...

***Katagiri***: Well we always do it. Something happens.

For instance... well here is a good example, okay? When I was at Eiheiji monastery, we had a big earthquake. It was evening of the day which we performed memorial service for Dogen's death. And then, that is 5:00. And then, right after service in the zendo, all monks are about the leave the zendo, and several people in the line, step out from the zendo, and then earthquake happened. Fortunately, there was not damage to Eiheiji monastery. The foundation, the hallways and steps dropped down almost an inch; no damage. But here is a very good example. One of my friends, that day was vacation, day off for him. So he took a day off, went to ... a little far from Eiheiji monastery, it took about 70 minutes at that time; now it's pretty quick, but at that time it took 7 minutes from Eiheiji monstastery to ... . So, he went there, and I don't know what he did, but he went. But he told me, he wanted to see a movie at that time. He wanted to see a movie. But he thought, tonight, memorial service. Tonight particular day of performing the memorial service for Dogen's death. Lets go back. So he returned. And then at that time, all movie theater completely crashed; everybody died. This is because ... If you have a big ... boom. All people completely died. He said he was saved. Do you understand? .... ?????

One more person is, right on the train, from (Fukui?) city to Eiheiji monastery. Because he thought also, today is the day of performing memorial service, so let's go back. So also he was in the train. And also he wanted to see the movie... but he was right in the middle of a trip. And then, train completely tripped off. But he survived. Do you understand? This is very good example.

***same person***: Okay, how do these terms relate to karma?

***Katagiri***: I don't know. I don't know.

That is karma, ... past life, and also, his karma in the past, might be good. He planted good karma in the past. That's why he wanted to see the movie, but he though, oh no, let's go back to Eiheiji monastery. So that is pretty good karma. From where that good sense comes, maybe from a past life. 

***same person***: So the karma ... influences...

***Katagiri***: Sure. In many ways. 

But only if the conditions, times, opportunities are rips and conditions arranged. That's why Dogen states, ... ... .... And then, karma start work. Which would you like? You want to go to movie, or you want go to Eiheiji monastery?

(1:00:06) ***same person***: How are those conditions separate from the body, if karma is involved? I mean, things don't happen randomly. 

***Katagiri***: How karma... What is your question? 

***same person***: When you talk about conditioned elements not relating to the truth of the mind? Did you say that? Well how is that so, if... ?

***Katagiri***: Well conditioned elements are very broad. Past, present, future. So, conditioned elements associated with karma. 

***same person***: But isn't that associated with mind?

***Katagiri***: No. Because that karma is completely beyond good or bad, right and wrong. If you judge the karma, it's good, it's bad, that means mind associated with karma. But karma is ... That is a conditioned element. That's why something happens. Rock, Gensha Shibi's toes. Something happens; but I don't know. You cannot say it is bad, it is good. Why can you do this? For instance if you walk on bridge, and the bridge immediately crashes, and you die. Why is it you have to die? No one knows. Well, there is a good example. ... in that way. And that is conditioned elements. That is completely good and bad. That is a matter of ... mind. So whether it is associated with karma and not associated with; completely beyond. Just conditioned elements. But anyway, karma, conditioned elements is related with the past, present, future. That is conditioned elements. 

Philosophically speaking, that is interdependent co-production. 

***same person***:
