... talked about zazen based on body and mind dropping off. Which means that from the first, dullness and distractions are struck aside, the moment we do zazen. This morning I would like to see this from a pretty different angle, that is sort of from the psychological point of view. You know pretty well in your primitive Buddhism, there is the categories of existence, which is called (the) five skandhas. Among the five skandhas, there is very interesting concept which is called samskara. In the Prajnaparamita Sutra, it is translated as "impulses". According to Doctor Conze (probably [Edward Conze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Conze)) it is regarded as "together-maker". That concept of samskara is very interesting teaching.

(2:05) In the development of Buddhism, this concept, samskara, is divided into many. For instance, in Abhidharmakosha, we learned this year already (in a talk?) given by Reb Anderson, that there are five psychological categories of existence. One is form elements, elements of form. That is the six organs, the six objects. The second one is six consciousnesses. The third category is called, what would you say, function; the concomitant mental faculties. That means function of mind; wholesome mind, wholesome functions and unwholesome functions, concomitant with main consciousnesses, six consciousnesses. So, many kinds of concomitant functions of the mind. For instance anger, hatred, et cetera; many things. That is the third one, and the fourth one is... This is very interesting point, the categories. Because this is an element which is not associated with mind. Not associated with mind of the six consciousnesses or concomitant mental faculties, or the elements of form. Or, the other one is the truth. That is the element which is completely not associated with the truth, and also the mind, and also form, and also the concomitant mental faculties. That is what is called samskara.

(5:12) So in Abhidharmakosha, samskara are divided into many things. But point is, that element - I am very interested in this element, which is not associated with mind, and not associated with truth. 

That is sort of a force. Well, according to the book, The Central Conception Of Buddhism ([archive.org link](https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.189881/2015.189881.The-Central-Conception-Of-Buddhism_djvu.txt); [Google Books link](https://books.google.com/books?id=C4HSakZwijIC&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=%22This+is+samskara+in+the+Buddhist+system%22&source=bl&ots=5i_tVITDm8&sig=ACfU3U2sXeTWnfGnSqQzvOecj4Vb2F04rQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwihipGzq9DrAhUYK80KHQTICW8Q6AEwAXoECAIQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22This%20is%20samskara%20in%20the%20Buddhist%20system%22&f=false)), he said about this: "a force, it must be recalled, shouldn't be regarded as a real influence of something extending beyond its own existence in order to penetrate into another. But, simply as a condition, or a fact, upon which another fact arises, or becomes prominent by itself. This is samskara in the Buddhist system." So, samskara as a force shouldn't be regarded as mere influence of something extending beyond its own existence in order to penetrate into another. So samskara is not your force(?) penetrating into another beings. But it is a condition, a kind of condition. A condition is a fact which occurs between two objects. But mainly these conditions are which is called origination and decay, according to primitive Buddhism; that is impermanence, or constant change. Appearing and disappearing, appearing and disappearing. So broadly speaking, force is understood like this. 

(8:04) Anyway, force is not a real force, but a condition. Conditioned element, which occurs between two objects. And also this conditioned element has a certain power to concert two things, to exist. So that's why this author says, "simply as a condition, or a fact, upon which another fact arises, or becomes prominent by itself." This is samskara. 

For instance, yesterday I told you that story about Gensha Shibi. On the way on his travels, he stumbled over, he struck his toes on a rock. Blood appeared, and he screamed, "Ouch!" And he had the question: "Body and mind do not exist. From where does this pain come?" So, he attained enlightenment from this point. He went back to his temple and practiced under Seppo Zen Master.

Well, let's recall this story(?). In rock, his toes, his body and mind, particularly his leg, and also his nails came out by the hitting. But they are simple objects. Rock; his toes. Between his toes and rock, there is no action of human consciousness. Is there something there? If there is something, it is called form, which means conditioned element. Conditioned element which happens between two objects. Rock, and toes. Something happens. That is conditioned. Under the condition, the two objects are combined, unified, as just one. At that time, something happens; that is called event, fact. That's why this author says, "simply as a condition, or a fact, upon which another fact arises". There is a fact, which is called conditioned element between the two, and then, two things are unified perfectly. And then, something happens. This is another fact. 

So, this is called event. Occurrence. So from this point, conditioned elements are sort of a force. Well sort of, but actually not a force, but some force(?) to enable(?) to be combined or unified, perfectly. That means, in other words, when the toe, his toe, Gensha Shibi's toe, is used perfectly, fitting into another object which is called rock, at that time, it is called "something happens". And on the other hand, when the rock is completely used perfectly, fitting into toe, at that time, that is called an event. This is samskara. 

So what is samskara? Samskara, "together-maker". "Together maker" means conditioned element. Conditioned elements are something which is not associated with your mind. But yesterday, or the day before yesterday, I told you mind is characterized by dichotomy. Characterized by dichotomy of two beings; always dichotomy. But in the realm of, in the context of, samskara, there is no mind which is associated with conditioned elements. No way; nothing. But, these conditioned elements are kind of force, which is called to combine, to unify two beings; object and subject. At that time, there is something (that) happens. So, in the process of combining and unifying two objects, there is no mind. It is perfect. Perfect. That's why there is no - even subtly, there is no room to let human conscious speculation insert into it. Nothing. That's why, very naturally, all delusions, dullness and distraction, throw up. No dullness, no distraction, no confusion. Completely nothing. 

(14:52) And then, something happens. And when something happens, that is event or occurrence. At that time, mind associates with this event. That is which is called after something. Something happens after. Mind associates with this occurrence which happened. And that is okay; that is very natural. Simultaneously, it happened. But the point is, at that time, when the mind attached to event, this is called conditioned world, dualistic world. But when mind doesn't attach to this event, it turns into the truth. That is unconditioned world. That's why samskara is sort of a bridge. Which leads(?) you to take to completely dualistic world, or not dualistic world. That is completely bridge, or door.

Door is free, always free. No delusions, no confusion; always, door exists. So something happens. And at the moment when it happens, mind associates, and that task to do something, at that time, you can enter into dualistic world. But when mind doesn't attach to, immediately you can go there, go to the truth. But unfortunately, mind is always characterized by dichotomy, I told you. So, more or less, we immediately enter into the dualistic world. 

But the point is, it's not necessary to be confused. We have to awaken to the nature of the mind, as much as possible, as best as we can, we have to awaken to. What is the characteristic of mind? Mind is immediately associate with occurrence and attach to it. At that time, you can get into the gate of the dualistic world. So you should awaken to it. If you awaken to it perfectly, through and through, that is very good chance to enter to (???) 

How? We have to use our bodies and minds, must be used perfectly. For what? Zazen. Or for what? For the rock. When your toe is completely used perfectly for rock, something happens. So in other words, we have to return to origin. Of origin of existential situation, conditions. Let's return to origin. That is, something happens. There is force between the two. So that conditioned element is kind of a force. To combine, to unify, to concert two things. Within this: no mind. Completely nothing. 

(19:16) But unfortunately we have a mind. We have a mind; so we cannot ignore the mind. We have to use the mind. 

That's why we have to use the mind. But first, we have to use our body. In other words, toe. Or, rock. Rock corresponds to zazen. Toes is your body. When your body is perfectly used for the rock or zazen, without mind associated with this condition - just a condition. Let's use the body in zazen; let's use the body perfectly, fitting into zazen. At that time, something happens. That is called zazen. That is an occurrence we can see. Immediately mind attach it: "oh, that is mine." This is too late! We see zazen; that is not real zazen, that is picture of zazen, image of zazen. We attach to it; and if we attached to it, that is your zazen is already in the dualistic world. It's not real zazen. 

(21:05) But if don't attach to it, if you don't attach to this event occurrence, your zazen turns into the gate of the truth, which is called unconditioned world. This is really beautiful zazen; blooms. 

(21:38) I already told you a few stories so far; and Dogen says also here lots of examples, but he didn't explain completely about each stories. But the few stories I told you really (???) implication of the meaning of shikantaza, zazen, based on body and mind dropping off. 

And then he says here, "In addition, the bringing about of enlightenment by the opportunity provided by a finger, a banner, a needle, or a mallet, and the effecting of realization with the aid of a hosu (whisk), a fist, a staff, or a shout," - those things come from the old stories between the Zen masters and the Zen monks. You can see in this book in the note. But overall it's not necessary, I don't have enough time to explain all things. That's why I told you a few stories; Gensha Shibi's, and one more thing I forgot. "... cannot be fully understood my man's discriminative thinking." You cannot understand why Gensha Shibi attained enlightenment by striking his toes, and by seeing the blood coming up. We don't understand why. The blood has mysterious power? I don't think so; blood is blood. His toes have particular mysterious powers? No. He didn't have telepathy. He didn't use telepathy, just rock. Rock is rock, has no mysterious power. Why (did) he attain enlightenment? [sound of police siren starts] Because I told you before, we are mind; something happens between rock, and toes, and Gensha Shibis, and the (???) - all are beings, which are not associated with mind. So everything exists, day after day, in the process of change. [police siren getting louder] In the stream of change. Birds, zazen, and that siren, all things exist in peace and harmony, in the stream of change. And then, something happens, according to conditioned element, which happens between the two. That is, conditioned element [mercifully, the police siren finally stops. Waiting to hear if anybody gets arrested] is characterized by one object, one being, used perfectly for another being. Fitting into its object, perfectly. This is conditional element.

[25:44] For instance, siren (sound?) comes up. So your ears hear the sound outside. When your ears completely used perfectly, fitting into sound, at that time, you can hear. By what? Conditioned elements, what is called source(?), together-maker. That conditioned element - from where it comes? We don't know. It's there. Well, according to Buddhist philosophy, that is called dependent origination. Or, change - constant change. (???) of the conditioned element, always. And the interdependence; always connected. 

The sound completely used for your ear, fitting into your ear perfectly. That is, at that time, well, your ear becomes one with sound. And then, something happens. That is sound. 

At that time, that is event. Then immediately, mind associates with this siren, or your ear. And then, that is a gate. Which would you like to go: this way, or that way? Very quick. And also, mind is very tricky. If you realize, "Hey, mind is very tricky," then you are already tricked. [laughter] You're already tricked. "I understand mind, how tricky mind is" - so you are already tricked by your understanding of how tricky mind is. So always, again and again, snowballing, first of all. Then finally, what you have to do is, stop it. Stop it. How can you stop it? You cannot stop your mind. So, first important thing: in order to stop your mind, first, your body must be used perfectly, fitting into your object. At that time, very naturally, mind stops. Because, my body and breath becomes one with zazen. At that time, my body completely one with zazen. And then, problem is, mind associates with, and attaches to it; at that time, you cannot see the oneness. And then, the mind misunderstands oneness. For instance, oneness is just like the moon reflected in the water. So, combination of two things. But it is not one. Because, two different things exist. So it's not. 

(29:25) So Dogen Zenji says in the Genjokoan... "Oneness is not like moon reflected in the water, water in which moon is reflected." So, what is oneness? Oneness is... oneness appears. Oneness manifests itself, only when your body is perfectly used and fitting into your object. At that time, your body merges itself in zazen. So, your body doesn't appear. (???) Just zazen. When you see zazen, just zazen. When you see your body, just the body appears, and zazen doesn't appear. For instance, we don't understand yet, because there is the (???) There is (???) lump of clay. However you use this clay, it depends on you. But let's imagine, we try to make a doll. Doll, or china, or plate - whatever it is. Let's make a plate ... dish, china. And also (???). But when you use perfectly this clay, a lump of clay, fitting into dish: at that time, where is the clay? You cannot call it, "that is clay." You say, "dish." When you see the dish, on the other hand, completely clay is hidden behind dish. Perfect. But when you make the doll with this clay, you don't call that clay, you call "doll". Japanese doll, or American doll; you say so. But at that time, it doesn't appear, in the realm of the doll world. Completely hidden. But it's not disappeared; it's always there. But we don't say; always we see the doll. (???) just see the doll, that's enough. If so, clay is hidden behind doll. Support, great support. But you cannot say always, "that is a doll." No, no clay. You cannot say. 

On the other hand, turn over. If you see the doll in terms of the clay: just the clay. It's clay. Same clay with which you make dish and doll. So you say, "those clays same." So in terms of the clay, doll and plate are completely hidden, behind clay. Just the clay appears. That's why we are interested in the subject of what kind of clay you use. (???). You don't care the doll. You don't care the dish. Analyzing (???). Because total picture of dish as a being possesses double face. But this double face is not combination of the two things. Just like the moon reflected in the water; it's not oneness. Oneness is, when you see the doll, just see the doll. At that time, clay doesn't appear. Dogen Zenji says, "When one is bright, the other one is dark." The other one is dark. "The other one is dark" doesn't mean the other one disappears. It can(?) but it doesn't (???). One side, doll's life and this life. It's great support, which doesn't appear yet, on the surface of doll's world. 

(34:50) So, this is normal. Same applies to our zazen. First of all, mind is always associating with events, which is called practice of zazen. So at that time we attach to, your zazen becomes, you enter into dualistic zazen. At that time, zazen is used as a means. But when your mind doesn't attach to it, your zazen enters into the truth.

So how can you stop the function of your mind? You cannot stop it. So (???) important point is, let's return to origin, which is called (samskara?) world. What is called, elements not associated with mind and truth, completely (???). Let's return to conditioned elements. What is how we can return to conditioned elements? Because I told you before, conditioned elements is characterized by unifying two beings, perfectly. That means, one object is used perfectly, fitting into its object. This is conditioned element. So, let's return to this. Using your body and breath, are used, perfectly, fitting into zazen. At that time, something happens. That is zazen as an event. 

So mind immediately catches it. That, "I got it." You catch it. The moment when you catch it, there is attachment. So, that's why regulation of the mind is important. That is, Dogen Zenji says, "Throw away good or bad, right and wrong. Have no designs on becoming a buddha." Through and through. Anyway, we have to practice of having no design of becoming buddha. No reward there. Just return to conditioned element. Using your body perfectly sitting into object, zazen. At that time, your body becomes one naturally with zazen. So your body is made as zazen. That's all. 

(37:58) And then when we see just the zazen, it is zazen. It is just zazen. When in your body, body is hidden behind zazen. But that body doesn't bother zazen. Just zazen. Just like a doll, and also (???).

But on the other hand, if you see that zazen from the back, which is called clay, or your body, breath and mind; at that time, body appears. But zazen is completely hidden behind. It doesn't bother you. Then at that time, mind, all delusions completely drop off. This is zazen; shikantaza. 

Shikantaza, based on dropping off body and mind, is not new idea mentioned Dogen. It's really Buddhism. Well, you can explain according to Buddhist psychology. But we don't understand real meaning of samskara, and also the elements which is not associated with mind. That's why we understand just as concept, apart from human life. That's why we don't understand. 

(39:44) And also, one of the elements which are not associated with mind, is obtaining or getting. That is one of the conditioned elements. Between the two, there is conditioned element, which is called obtain, getting. In Sanskrit we say "prapti": to get, to obtain.

(40:40) ... There are three kinds of obtaining and getting. Obtaining is to obtain and complete something. That is a characteristic of conditioned element: to get and complete. There are three kinds of getting and completing. That is: you can sew a seed of the truth. Even though your body and mind exist in the dualistic world, you can sew a seed. So seed is completely seed, not (prapti?); seed.

And also, you can manifest; your actions are actualized. In other words you can manifest your actions in your daily living. That is complete prapti(?). Even though you are in dualistic world, you can plant, you can complete. You can complete buddha's world right now, right here, and actualized in your daily living. This is the second obtaining and completion. 

And then, on the other hand, is seed. You don't actualize, but you can sew a seed. For instance, shikantaza, you don't... in the shikantaza, all delusions drop off and you don't understand. But, if you do zazen, anyway you can sew a seed, in your mind, in your life. But it doesn't appear. No. But, someday. If you do it, if you really do zazen, using perfectly your body, fitting into zazen, at that time it's actualization of zazen itself. So even though you don't understand, you gain something and complete something. As a truth. Even though you are dualistic world, you can do. 

(43:20) Third one is, you are completely not interested. [chuckles] Well, "Katagiri says zazen is important, so let's try to do zazen, you know how (he is?)." This is zazen. It doesn't appear. You can plant a seed. But someday, somewhere, real zazen will grow. So this is another opportunity, possibility. 

(44:00) So three possibilities. One possibility is to plant a seed. Second possibility is to actualize, in order to complete in your daily living; you can do it. And third possibility is, no interest. That means, "This zazen; I don't know." (???) No spirit. No spirit of zazen. But, Katagiri says, let's do zazen. That's right, so, just do zazen. 

But this is also pretty good. Because that is possibility which will bloom in the future. That is called completion of liberation, freedom. Completion of freedom. In other words, you are free. No particular realm, good or bad or neutral. Your life is so-so. Are you happy? No. Are you unhappy? No. Are you neutral? No. Well, how do you feel? So-so. 

(45:35) This is (???) But still there is a past state. 

So that is one of the conditioned elements, which is called obtaining and getting. So between the two objects, zazen and you, there are three kinds of conditioned elements. Three kinds of conditioned elements means three kinds of possibility exist. You can plant a seed, right now, with your body, completely. According to instructions, you can plant seeds - even though you don't understand. Or, you can completely actualize, actualize completion. According to possession and instructions; you can find, you can realize. But if you actualize exactly, even though intellect cannot reach, it's really actualized. You cannot (???). So, you can complete something in your daily living. 

But also between zazen and you there is another possibility. "Well, I don't understand." "Well, I don't want to do, but, I want (???)" 

The best way, that is ...

[tape change]

[47:19] ... in (???) of conditioned elements. How? Using your body, perfectly fitting into your object. At that time, your body becomes one with zazen, zazen becomes one with you, very naturally. At that time, there is something happens. That is called zazen. The question is, mind attach to it. That's why Dogen Zenji says, lets practice regulation of the mind. No (de)sign of having reward. That is the problem. He have to understand, what is mind? Very tricky mind, very monkey mind, always.

Well, we have to make every possible effort to do that. We have a mind. Mind is already here. That's why we have to practice. 

Dogen Zenji says, that's why, "cannot be fully known by the practicing or realizing of supernatural power either." Even though you can find there, you cannot understand this kind of zazen. Or, Dogen Zenji says, "It must be deportment beyond man's hearing and seeing." If you see zazen after your zazen, that is image of zazen. It is not real zazen. Deportment means, behavior, which is called zazen. In Japanese we call igi(?). (Possibly [Igi 威儀](https://www.wordhippo.com/what-is/the-meaning-of/japanese-word-0d45dfac78c794d7b6efef7af8dee3925de5d40b.html)) The 'I' of igi means "majestical and awe-inspiring". Majestic, very majestic. "Gi" of Igi means fitting into or mention of the truth. That is form, your behavior. That is deportment; here it says deportment, but originally we use igi. Usually we use 'behavior', but that behavior is 'igi' in Buddhism, because that behavior has sense of majestic, and also a sense of the awe inspiring. Fitting into the rhythm(?) of the truth. That is your behavior.

This behavior, which is called zazen, is completely beyond hearing or seeing through the six consciousnesses. Let's return to conditioned elements; that's all. But, Dogen Zenji says, "Is it not the principle that is prior to his knowledge and perception?" That is, that zazen, completely beyond hearing and seeing, is not mysterious thing. There is still (???) being, it is in accord with function of the knowledge and perception. Let's use your body and mind. Breath and mind are perfectly fitting into one object, called zazen. At that time, something happens. 

(51:41) And after that, mind associates. That's all. Then mind says, "ahh, that's zazen." And then you touch it. But before mind, prior to function of your mind, it's really, that's it. It's very simple practice. That's why Dogen Zenji says, "is it not a principle that is prior to his knowledge and perceptions." (???) You have to (???) really fit into your knowledge and perceptions. 

(52:30) Do you have questions?

***Question***: Roshi? In (???) Buddhism, I remember ready in a couple places, where he talked about prapti, and not exactly opposite, but (???) apropti. And he talked about prapti different than you. He called it a force that keeps positives together in one being. 

***Katagiri***: Positives, yes.

***same person***: And the aprapti is some force that keeps away.

***Katagiri***: Yes.

***same person***: Could you say a little more about that?

***Katagiri***: Well that is, changing. Changing, function of change; stream of change, broadly speaking. So we analyze that function of change, dividing into several things. Again(?), prapti and aprapti, these are categories, just categories. So that means, broadly speaking, there is some force to combine, to put together something, to separate, always. That means appearance, disappearance. 

***same person***: Could you develop a specific example, of, just, something in everyday life...

***Katagiri***: Well, we always do it. Something happens.

For instance... Well, here is a good example, okay? 

(54:10) When I was at Eiheiji monastery, we had a big earthquake. It was evening of the day which we performed memorial service for Dogen's death. And then - that is 5:00. And then, right after service in the zendo, all monks are about the leave the zendo, and several people in end of the line step out from the zendo, and then earthquake happened. Fortunately, there was no damage to Eiheiji monastery. The foundation, the hallways and steps dropped down almost an inch, that's all. No damage. 

But here is a very good example. One of my friends; that day was vacation, a day off for him. So he took a day off, went to (???), a little far from Eiheiji monastery, it took about 70 minutes at that time; now it's pretty quick, but at that time it took 70 minutes from Eiheiji monastery to (???). So, he went there, and, I don't know what he did, but he went. But he told me, he wanted to see a movie at that time. He wanted to see a movie. But he thought, "Oh, tonight, memorial service. Tonight, particular day of performing the memorial service for Dogen's death. Let's go back." So he returned. And then at that time, all movie theater completely crashed; everybody died. This is because (???)  If you have a big earthquake, exactly, "boom". All people completely died. But he said he was saved. Do you understand? This is a very good example. [Group laughter; perhaps because no one understands how this is a good example.]

One more person is, right on the train, from (Fukui?) city to Eiheiji monastery. Because he thought also, "Oh, today is the particular day of performing a memorial service for Dogen. So let's go back." He also, he was in the train. And also he wanted to see the movie, but he was at that time right in the middle of the trip. And then, train completely tipped off. But he survived. Do you understand? This is very good example.

***same person***: Okay, how do these terms then relate to karma?

***Katagiri***: I don't know. I don't know.

[laughter]

That is karma, maybe past life. Well, you can envision past life, and also, his karma in the past might be good. He planted good karma in the past. That's why he wanted to see the movie, but he thought, "Oh, no, let's go back to Eiheiji monastery." So that is pretty good karma. From where that good sense comes, maybe from a past life. 

***same person***: So the karma in influences how strong (???) ...

***Katagiri***: Sure. In many ways. 

But only if the conditions, times, opportunities are ripe and conditions arranged. (???) That's why Dogen's memorial day, his day off, all set up. And then, karma start work. Which would you like? You want to go to movie, or you want go to Eiheiji monastery?

(1:00:06) ***same person***: How then are those conditions separate from the body, if karma is involved? I mean, things don't happen randomly. 

***Katagiri***: How karma... What is your question? 

***same person***: When you talk about conditioned elements and ... not relating to the truth of the mind? Did you say that? Well how is that so, if... ?

***Katagiri***: Well, conditioned elements are very broad. Past, present, future. So, conditioned elements associated with karma. 

***same person***: But isn't that associated with mind?

***Katagiri***: No. Because that karma is completely beyond good or bad, right and wrong. If you judge the karma, it's good, it's bad, that means mind associated with karma. But karma is just karma. That is a conditioned element. That's why something happens. Rock, Gensha Shibi's toes. Something happens; but I don't know. You cannot say it is bad, it is good. Why can you do this? Well, we don't know. For instance if you walk on bridge, and the bridge immediately crashes, and you die. Why is it you have to die? No one knows. Well, there is a good example. Someone dies in that way, and that is conditioned elements. That is completely good and bad. That is a matter of (???) mind. So whether it is associated with karma, and not associated with, completely beyond. Just conditioned elements. But anyway, karma, conditioned elements, is related with the past, present, future. That is conditioned elements. 

Philosophically speaking, that is interdependent co-production. 

***same person***: Well then, we can still see the instant without attaching to it and learning from that? Because, perhaps if he'd have noticed the rock an instant before, he wouldn't have bumped his toe on it.

***Katagiri***: mm-hm?

***same person***: Gensha had noticed a rock.

***Katagiri***: I don't know. Maybe so.

***same person***: ... Can we look at that and see that without attaching to it?

(1:03:34) ***Katagiri***: That is already process of your mind, which is working. The rock and his toes completely are beings, as they really are. From moment to moment, completely beyond, prior to function of the mind, consciousness. Toes, and his body, and rock. Just there. 

If his mind is working before he struck his toes, maybe he didn't, he wouldn't have such an event. But already here, something. That means, rock as a being, beyond function of mind. 

But how do they associate with each other? So I don't know, we don't know. Because between the two, something connected. 

That connection not something happens right now. It's really connected with the past and future. And that's very broad. 

That's why if you don't pay careful attention to your life, well, many things come up. That's why all we have to do is, to use (???) with our best. Fitting into object. Zazen, if we want to do zazen. And become one. 

And then after that - well, that's it. Mind associates and attaches. 

(1:05:45) So, yesterday, according to my talk yesterday, we are always seeing before zazen and after zazen. We miss middle; middle, that is real zazen. But we always understand zazen before zazen and after zazen. Or you before zazen, you after zazen. We always look and check; analyze. But we miss most important zazen and practice is middle. Is that clear?

***same person***: Mm-hm.

***Question***: Roshi? In Dogen's writings, [unintelligible] water, moon (???) what is the water (???)

***Katagiri***: Water is, according to Dogen's understanding, that is the whole universe. That water is the occupying (???) space; water is universe. When the water becomes one with moon, when the water (???) moon, at that time, water is not water, water is whole universe. At that time, there is no combination, no combination of water and moon.

If you see the water, immediately there is the moon. But that moon doesn't appear. That's why Dogen Zenji says, "when one is bright, the other one is dark." That means, water appears. That water is really blooming of the universe. Not water; universe.

Universe includes moon, water, tree, birds; that is real meaning of the water's life. 

(1:08:20) ***Question***: Roshi? Were the two monks expressing their life when they went back to the monastery? Or were they picking and choosing?

***Katagiri***: Two monks?

***same person***: The two monks, your friends that you described. To go back; was that an expression of their life? Or were they picking and choosing? And what's the difference?

***Katagiri***: Oh of course, he chose. He chose. His life. But by what? What part of his mind did he choose? I don't know. Maybe karma is connected with the past life, present life, future life. 

There are many conditions there, many things there. So in the future, the monastery is there, and in the past, his, maybe, karma, he planted seed in the past. And then many things combined, unified, and (???). Something happened. 

And then his mind catch it. That's event. Monastery, and  movies, and his karmas, all things put together, and then something happens. And then, mind catch it. And then mind chooses, let's go there. 

(1:10:20) ***Question***: I still don't understand the statement, "The body does not exist." (???) He said, "the body does not exist," or something like that?

***Katagiri***: Well, if you use the term "body and mind," already that is the image of body and mind. You are already taken in by the (world?), the trick, already. The body and mind doesn't exist means, well, body and mind is what? Body and mind is nothing but a being which exists, right now, right here, beyond good or bad, right and wrong. So, body is what? Well, very important thing, but on the other hand, it's not important. So if you judge the body from your mind - in other words, if you see the body after something, before something; if you understand the body before and after, you always (???). But really body and mind is just the being becoming one with you. Becoming one with some event. 

If you strike your toes on the rock, your body and mind - what? Nothing but the toes. The toes exemplify your whole body and mind.

So, toes, your body, are just the beings as it is, beyond human speculation. Before you judge, before you see your body, before something happens. And also after, if you see your body after, something happens. You can say, that is the body. That's why you attach to it and scream, ouch. But right in the middle of the current(?), body doesn't, no idea of body, because toes, rock, just one. That's all.

Body, rock, conditions ... just one. Your toes are used perfectly for the rock, fitting into it. That's all. Something happens. 

***same person***: Why does the pain continue? Is that your mind [unintelligible]

***Katagiri***: Yes. Pain is sort of the idea, image, of some of your experience. Real pain is no pain. But if your mind attaches to something, it is called, sometimes, pain, it is called pleasure. Your toe, your body, is just one with rock, right in the middle of event. No idea of body, no idea of rock, no idea of toes, no idea of pain. Just all things put together, combined. Combined and appear(?). In this realm, there is no confusion. Just all thing put together. And after that, immediately, mind attach to it. And then, you say, "Body. I have a toe." And then you say, "Ouch!" 

(1:14:53) That's why he said, "Body and mind doesn't exist; from where (does) pain come?" Actually, pain comes from, no abode. "No abode" means, just the functioning of the two things, rock and toe. Just the function, total dynamic working, that's all. Within this, no pain. Sort of a death. If you become one with the death: no pain, no pleasure, nothing. Just dynamic working between death and us. After that, immediately I say, "Ah, this is death!" But it's too late. We do always, in our daily living. "I died. Oh! This is death." And though we say that is, body and mind exist. But I don't think so. 

But we cannot ignore that. That's why we have to, we have already mind, and also we have lots of customs we have accumulated in the past. That's why we have to pay careful attention to our body and mind, how to use them, perfectly fitting into circumstances. Environment; zazen, or whatever. 

***Question***: (???) Does mind exist before these things take place?

***Katagiri***: The mind already exists. 

***same person***: The mind is always existing? 

***Katagiri***: Exists. Of course.

***same person***: Independent of these things? Independent of toe hitting rock?

***Katagiri***: Oh, independent. You mean the mind is independent. Yes, actually mind is independent from that total dynamic working. Yes. [some laughter] The original nature of the mind is already there. Original nature of the mind is what? Not mind. No mind. It's just conditioned origination. Conditioned co-production. 

***same person***: ... But anyway, mind exists before these things are happening. 

***Katagiri***: Yes. Original face of the mind is exactly same as being. Just like rock and toes and trees and birds, many things. Same. That's why we call (them) dharmas. Everything is called dharmas. So mind, unwholesome mind or wholesome mind, whatever kind - all dharmas. Completely same. 

***Question***: Can we speak about mind apart from dharmas? 

***Katagiri***: No, we cannot. 

***same person***: Can't talk about (???) ...

***Katagiri***: We have to talk ... If you want to talk about mind, you have to talk about mind as the dharma. Because that is a mind, that is a dharma which exists in dualistic world, and also which exists in the truth. Has the original nature of the mind. At that time, no mind. In the truth, in the context of the truth, there is no idea of the mind. That's why Prajnaparamita says no mind; no eyes, no ears. But how can we know no mind? That's why Dogen Zenji says, in the chapter of Prajnaparamita Sutra he said, there is mind, there is eyes, nose, ears, and et cetera. That means, use eye, ear, nose, mind, body, perfectly, accommodating to zazen as it is. At that time, mind, nose and eyes become one with zazen. So no eye, no mind, no mouth.

Do you understand? That is the meaning of no mind. No mind doesn't mean destroy. So using your mind perfectly. How? Fitting into single object, zazen. At that time, there is no mind. 

***Question***: Sometimes you, or in the past, you or (????) somebody, talked about big mind, small mind. When you talk about mind here, Roshi, what are you referring to? Big mind, small mind?

***Katagiri***: Both. I'm talking about both.

So picky mind, monkey mind, is small mind. But original nature of mind is big mind. 

***Question***: You're talking about big mind.

***Katagiri***: Yes, big mind. But we cannot ignore small mind. Because, right after event occurs, mind associates with, so you can't ignore. That's why in our practice, we have to practice regulation of the mind. Constantly we have to be mindful of no planning of having a reward, becoming buddha; no design. Continually do. Otherwise, we cannot use our body and mind perfectly, fitting into zazen. 

(1:22:10) ***Question***: Roshi? [unintelligible] your explanation (???) What I wanted to know is, what the mind is right now.

***Katagiri***: That's why I said the universe. Mind is right now. 

Right now, right here; it doesn't mean something limited by something, which is called water. Right now, right here is what? Right now, right her is universe. If you say universe, you are already tricked by the word universe. The universe is what? Total function of right now, right here. How do you see real meaning of right now, right here, of the universe? Be alive, right now, right here. 

So whatever you say, that is a water, that is a moon; that's okay, according to this. But when you come back to dualistic world, water is water. Moment is moment. Space is space, time is time. Toe is toe, Katagiri is Katagiri. So, how can you know the universe? Using the toe, using right now, right here, perfectly fitting into your object. At that time, Universe (moves?). That is (one?). It is not combination of the water and the moon. 

1:24:30 So that's why Dogen Zenji says, the self is whole universe. And also, time is being. Time is not time; time is being. Time is space. Space is time.

Time is being, when you say, "now, right now, and right here." What is time is being? We cannot put a name on it. That's why we say "now-ness," or "now and here-ness," (???) "eternity," or "eternal time," or any other kind of words you use; it's very difficult to (???). Now and here (???)

(1:25:33) So, water is your self, this whole universe; it's timeless being. 

[tape skip]
(1:25:50) ***Question***: [unintelligible]

***Katagiri***: Because we have enjoyed small mind for many years. So we have got used to enjoying it, for many, many years. Not only your life; from the beginingless past. Anyway, we did, we have done, always. That's why it's pretty hard to see the big mind immediately. It really depends on the individual. 

Maybe someone, we can see big mind after practicing of three years, or five years, maybe ten years. Maybe so. It doesn't matter. 

Is that okay? That's why it's pretty hard.

But important point is, we have to practice zazen not as the being involved in the many things in the dualistic world. Analyzing, synthesizing; "I like this," "I don't like this," "I feel good," "I don't feel good," "that's why I want do this," "I don't want to do this"... This is very messy. No matter how long you practice zazen, you cannot find big mind. Anyway, that is that; it's not necessary to destroy or hate or like. Let them be alone. All you have to do is, just, right zazen, if you want to do zazen.

***Question***: Roshi? Is apropti always present when propti is present? 

***Katagiri***: That is a very conceptualized term. There are lots of terms there. But in Mahayana Buddhism we don't believe it is really something which exists. If you say something which exists, it has substance. 

***same person***: Okay, well in the story you gave us as an example, of prapti and apropti, it seemed to me, if I understand it right, prapti was the force that brought your friend back to the monastery, and apropti was the earthquake. And they were both present at that time. I think; if I understand the terms.

***Katagiri***: Aprapti is kind of force which kept my friend to Eiheiji monastery separate from the movie theater. Keep them away, saving him from death. Do you understand, that is aprapti, something separate; force to separate. Sometimes put together; at that time, unfortunately, you have to die. But he was saved. That is, maybe, force of aprapti.

***Question***: Do you mean, Roshi, because he changed his mind?

(1:29:50) ***Katagiri***: Aprapti is not obtaining or not getting. That is a force, kind of force. That means conditioned element. So, before your mind is exercised, there is something (???), some kind of force. To attach to, or to separate from. To put together, or to separate. That is total dynamic working.

Is that clear? That is aprapti; force to separate from something. 

***same person***: Is that like inertia, Roshi?

***Katagiri***: Nausea?

***same person***: Inertia.

***Katagiri***: Inertia. What is that?

***same person***: The force that... Things at rest tend to stay at rest, and things that are moving tend to...

***Katagiri***: No, if you say force, that force has a certain kind of power, to penetrate into another.

***same person***: No, that's (???) It sounds like (???) So things that, like what you're talking about prapti and aprapti, things that at rest tend to stay at rest unless something...

***Katagiri***: No.

***Question***: Roshi? What simplified it for me was when you explained in the book that aprapti was more a force that kept away the negatives, and prapti was the force that brought towards you positives. Is that correct understanding?

***Katagiri***: Towards you or towards your object.

***Question***: So are these functions, functioning people that are actively engaged in practicing the buddha's way? 

***Katagiri***: Who?

***Question***: Aprapti and prapti. In the two in the example you gave, both of those people were monks, they were practicing the Buddha's way. And we're talking about either being drawn to positive or kept away from negative things. Are, are those terms also used just to describe events in anyone's life? In Roman Catholics' life?

***Katagiri***: Sure. [laugher] Universal. Yes.

***Question***: Are they simultaneous, Roshi? Prapti and aprapti? Do they operate simultaneously? 

***Katagiri***: Sometimes together, sometimes different. Because sometimes you can see them both. Say "I want to go there," "I don't want to go there." (???) you don't know what to do. So original nature of such a feeling comes from prapti and aprapti. But intellectually you know pretty well, you should choose this one. But actually you don't know what to do. So you can see the both. So sometimes both work together, sometimes separately. 

***Question***: Roshi, do you know (???) creation stories? Most cultures have them; religions have creation stories that explain how it all started. Like "Adam and Eve" is a creation story...

[tape change]

(1:34:00) ***Katagiri***: Well, the Abhidharma-kosha, there is a work on human world, the structure of the human world, the structure of human beings. They explain how the world created. Just like creation of world mentioned by Christianity.

According to, I told you, Mount Sumeru, right in the middle of the Universe, there is the huge Mount Sumeru. At top of the mountain, the gods exists; eightfold kinds of guardians exist, protecting the gods. And also eight mountains, and nine beautiful, frequent, (???). And then, four kinds of (???) exist. North, south, east, west. (???) is human world. 

This is explanation of that thing. In the first book of Abhidharmakosha, the whole book is explanation of how to (????) form exists. Very interesting.
