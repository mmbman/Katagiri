> This talk is still in the process of being transcribed. It is an incomplete rough draft at the moment.

(The first part of this talk appears to be missing.)

... Objects exist. How your objects are structures. You have to inquire into this family style. The qualities of seas and mountains beyond seeming square or round, are endlessly numerous. So, until you can see this numerous qualities in the ocean, in the object, in the mountains, in the trees, you see now. Anyway, we have to train our six senses, constantly. By what? Well, meditation is (the) best way. 

We should realize there exists world everywhere. Those qualities, all qualities of seas and mountains, what you cannot see, is not something far from us. They exist right in front of us, and within them, within us. So, we should realize there exists a world everywhere. 

It's not only that; in out of the way places, know that even a single drop right before us is also vast. Even a single dew, thing exists exactly like this. That's why in the sutras of the mountains and waters mentioned by Dogen Zenji, he says, "Instant  moment, instant present of the mountains of water are total manifestation of buddhas' ancestors. He says as a first sentence. That means, we always see the mountains as mountains, but, according to Dogen's and ancestors, who realized myriad, myriad qualities of mountains and rivers we cannot see. Anyway, suggest as to see the mountains as ancestors and buddhas, means something more than concept of the mountains and seas you have believed. So, don't act quickly on the concept of the mountain according to you understanding. 

So even though you don't struggle for it, but sit in zazen, calm the six senses and go deeply into you. And then, naturally, depths of the self is exactly the same as the depths of the world. 

There are two important points here. In the beginning I mentioned, one point is that there is no space for you to, what would you say, to understand or to touch something true. No space. No space, no room for you. That's why I mentioned the more you try to research, you try to inquire into the true meaning of the self, the more you feel unsatisfactory. No matter how long you try to get it, you can't get it. It means, no space for you to try to get it with your hands. This is one aspect.

Second: If so, should we give up? The idea of giving up means is already one of your understanding. So it's not right. So, completely... second point is, in the realm of no space for you to poke your head into the truth, you have to seek for it. In other words, on the foundation of nothing - no space, no room - you have to build up your house. This is the Buddhistic way; no, not Buddhistic way. This is true way of human life, wherever you may go. 

(5:55) So let's see... I think the other day I mentioned manas, seventh consciousness. One of the unconsciousness(es). Manas is the self or attachment consciousness. In other words, ego consciousness. Very deep; it is unconscious. 

So in Buddhist psychology, it's set up seventh consciousness among the eight consciousnesses. Six consciousnesses and manas, and Alayavijñāna. Eight consciousnesses in all. Manas is a very basic sort of ego consciousness, which is unconscious. It has three characteristics. Buddhist psychology mentions like this, manas always accompanied by (???) which means congenital concept of 'I'. Congenital means inborn concept of 'I'. Manas always accompanied by the congenital concept of 'I', continues spontaneously in a perpetual and homogeneous series. So, three points. One is, manas is spontaneous. Second, manas is perpetual. Third, manas is homogeneous. 

(8:45) Those three points are the point of the difference between the six consciousness and seventh consciousness, manas. Six consciousnesses are, you know, eye consciousness, nose consciousness, ear consciousness, tongue consciousness, body consciousness, and conscious mind. Those are (the) six consciousnesses. The seventh consciousness is quite different from those six consciousnesses, because it is very basic state of ego consciousness, very strong ego consciousness. It appears very spontaneously. Spontaneously means very unconscious; it's alive very unconsciously, unintentionally, or 'inborn'. Not automatic. Automatic is still a sense of dichotomy. But, very intentionally, ... it is very (un)intentionally or unconsciously and inborn way. 

(10:47) That is one point, because the manas itself doesn't create ego, but with manas there is some function, some quality of manas. That quality of manas is called sacaya... congenital concept of the 'I'. Before you are born, you have this kind of function, subtly, of your conscious. That is simultaneously, something of the habits(?) That is one point.

Second is, homogeneous means, manas perceives no dichotomy of 'I' and mind. But always 'I' only. But six consciousnesses always dichotomize subject and object, and then we say 'I' or mind, dichotomize. But this, manas, always perceives the 'I' only. So always the same. Manas remains in the same state of it's own existence. Do you understand? Practically, you experience.

You always struggle, under all circumstances, because - why? Because, in an unconscious level, there is a consciousness which remains in the same, always same, in one state of its own existence. That is, energy to live. Do you understand? If your circumstances are very bad, you are really struggling, crying - this is also, also energy to live. And if you feel happy, that is also energy to live. Very unconsciously, it is always going. 

With your head, always you say, "I am ready to die," or "I am ready to do this, or to do that." "I am ready to accept you, or not" - whatever you say, it is nothing but the world of conceptualization. But beyond this one, there is a great energy to live. Under all circumstances, you know? This is called manas. Manas remains in the same, one state of existence. So-called, the inborn concept of the "I". So no "I and mind," but six consciousness always say "I" and "mine," "You" and "yours." Means, dichotomies. 

(14:55) That is the second. And, perpetual. Manas is constantly going. Constantly going means, six consciousness doesn't go constantly. For instance, I and you are separate. But you cannot always remain in the same state of "I" and "you". Always changing. Sometimes, you become I, and I become you. So, always changing. You are right, I am wrong; this is dichotomy, but it doesn't go constantly. Next moment, it turns over, so you are wrong, I am right. So it's not perpetual. But seventh consciousness is perpetual. Perpetual means, completely beyond your understanding. It's always going.

So, if you study and practice Buddhism through meditation and zazen, then you can go deeply. If you feel, if you understand even intellectually about manas, which has three characteristics: it is spontaneous, and perpetual, and homogeneous; if you understand these characteristics of manas, even intellectually, you can go deep, you can touch something deep, about you. So through the practice, through the meditation, not only understanding with your head, but practice - you touch, you feel directly, this one - that is called deep understanding, profound understanding of the self.

(17:20) And then, if you really feel the state of manas, how it is going, spontaneously, and homogeneously, and perpetually, that means completely no concept. You cannot put any concept on it, because it is perpetual; it's vast. 

So ... understand manas is kind of a "dead end" of your life. But on the other hand, manas is not dead end; that is a start point. You can go any place. 

So that's why, if you practice zazen, in the beginning, you can feel good. You can feel very satisfactory. But if you go deeply, you come to the terminal stations, so you don't know - really don't know. The more you practice zazen, you see there's something confused. 

But, I think you cannot stop. So you have to go deep, and deep, going through and through. Then, naturally, you can see, you can touch, very deeply and directly, that manas. Which is spontaneous, and perpetual, and homogeneous. Then, manas becomes very vast. 

(19:10) So finally what you have to do is, give up. Give up means, let go of your head. It means, let go of your thoughts. 

We see always self, through the head. That self is something fabricated by thinking process; subject and object. So very naturally, it is always changeable. But we don't know what it is. We always believe that as the self, and also believe it fully, and jump into it, and live with it. And then finally, completely confused. That always happens. 

(20:15) I think finally, "give up" means let go of all thoughts. Because the more you try to get it, the more you feel unsatisfactory. So I always mention that the partition between dead end and eternity. There's something spontaneous, perpetual and homogeneous. The other side is something like that. This side is human world. There is no space to poke your head into it; this is human world. Then if you practice deeply, then you can cut this partition. That partition is, I always mention, just like cotton. It's not (like a) board; it's not sharp. It's very soft, very soft. It's not cardboard, it's not a piece of paper; it's very thin cotton. If you touch it, it moves. If you touch, and then finally immediately you can go this way. You can participate in eternal, and something vast.
