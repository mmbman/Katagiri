This case doesn’t have a pointer, just a case and verse. The conversation between Yang Shan and the monk in this case is construed in a very common or usual way, to all intents and purposes. But sometimes we don’t understand why [in Zen we have to] think again about these [so-called] usual conversations. In a sense, the Zen spirit is a little bit cryptic; it’s not the usual way. But in a good sense I think the Zen spirit is very compassionate to us. That’s why it’s pretty hard to understand. With this conversation, it doesn’t matter whether it is valuable or not; the important point is that we have to have open eyes to see the human world, visible and also invisible, in a little bigger scale. You have to see it. If you understand just the surface of human life, it’s not good enough for us to live in peace and harmony. 

This is not only Zen teaching; this is human life. We live just like this. But we don’t pay attention to it, because we have been trained for a long time, since your birth, or since before your birth, in thinking, analyzing, criticizing; just understanding the surface of human life, and making everything neat. But human life or the human world is not just like that; it’s very deep and big. So your understanding must be deepening day after day, year after year. If you don’t understand, practice continually and deepen your life until you have your eyes open enough to see the vastness of existence. 

Look at your daily routine: getting up in the morning, and washing your face, having breakfast, going to school. You have never paid attention to this stuff, because that’s daily routine. So if you feel good from this from this daily routine, and then the next moment you don’t feel good, you are disappointed. Your way of life has nothing to do with something more than the daily routine which you can see. You always handle daily routine [with] give and take. What do you feel, getting up in the morning? If you like it, get up; if you don’t like it, don’t get up; that’s all. If you like or you don’t like it, it is alright, but within the practice of getting up in the morning, there are huge energies to support your life, to keep your life for a day and for the next day, because it’s connected with not only your life, but others’ lives. If you sleep late, for instance if you sleep until ten o’clock or eleven o’clock, have you experienced that all day your life is really cloudy, evasive? You don’t know what to do; you’re very tired. Have you ever experienced this? I have experience it, anyway. *[He laughs.]* And then you feel good, but you are tired from sleeping for a long time. So getting up at ten o’clock in the morning is not only your life, your life getting up at ten o’clock is already connected with all sentient beings for a day, for two days, for three days... That’s why your life doesn’t work in a day. So even though you feel sleepy, get up in the morning; and then if you come here and do zazen, then you feel good! Completely your life situation has changed. And then your life is just going smoothly.

If you get up in the morning, and see somebody on the street or in the house, and you say, “good morning”: what do you mean by “good morning”? Is it just a formality of human life? Just get up and say, “good morning, sir,” and that’s enough? I don’t think that’s enough. Behind the “good morning”, there is a big world to support your life and support others’ lives. Then this vastness of existence appears in a certain form, so-called “good morning”, and then you can communicate with each other – because you and others are already in the vastness of existence, regardless of whether you are conscious of it or not. This world, the vastness of existence, is always working, appearing and disappearing. When it appears, it says, “Good morning!” This “good morning” is not merely the good morning which you can see. You have to see “good morning” on the surface of life and also in the vastness of life, including you and others.

So that’s why even though Yang Shan talks with this monk with the usual conversation – “Where do you come from?” – this is always a question in Zen. And this monk answers in just the usual sense. “From where do you come” is very common; everyone asks this, just like a “good morning” when you see somebody in the morning. It is exactly construed in the usual way, the usual conversation, but still we have to take into account again, a little carefully. So that’s why this case brings up this very simple conversation. While we have to understand this usual conversation, we don’t understand this; that means through the daily routine, through the usual conversation, there is something more that you don’t know. So you should pay careful attention once more to that broad scale of human life. That is the purpose of this case. 

##### 12:20

Anyway, the monk said, “Mount Lu.” Mount Lu means the mountains named Lu.

Yang Shan said, “Did you visit Five Elders Peak?” Maybe this Mount Lu has five old peaks. 

This mountain is located where this monk lives, so he can visit the mountain any time. For instance, Mount Fuji in Japan: I can climb Mount Fuji any time. But I have never visited Mount Fuji. And also, when Americans go to Japan, you go to the *[unintelligible]*, which are very fancy old temples, painted with gold – a very fancy, wonderful, gorgeous shrine. But I have never visited there. So *you* may know it pretty well, but I don’t know it. The Japanese know pretty well the Grand Canyon, but maybe some of you don’t know the Grand Canyon. *[Laughter.]* 

So, “Did you visit the Five Elders Peak?” The monks says, “I didn’t get there.” 

##### 14:28

According to tradition, let’s [read] this conversation [along with Yuan Wu’s] notes. The notes really give a hint about how you understand or how you deal with this conversation. 

> Yang Shan asked a monk, “Where have you just come from?”  
>  
>> Everyone in the world is the same. Still it is necessary to ask. (The monk) will inevitably construe it in the ordinary way.

So first of all, for “where have you just come from,” the note says, “Everyone in the world is the same.” That means, [answering the question as] daily routine. 

But, “still it is necessary to ask.” If it is daily routine, is it not important? Yes, it’s important! That’s why you have to get up in the morning and deal with your body, your face, and water. It *is* important, that’s why you do it every day. If it is not necessary to do it, I think you should do it just one day; the next day, [you know] it’s not necessary to do it. But it *is* necessary; whatever you feel from the daily routine, it is necessary to do it. So that’s why it says, “Everyone in the world is the same” for the question “Where do you come from?” It is necessary for us. 

“(The monk) will inevitably construe it in the ordinary way.” He just talks in the ordinary way. It’s very smooth going. His mind is not [crooked]; he makes the usual answer. 

##### 16:37

> The monk said, “Mount Lu.”  
> 
>> A truthful man is hard to find.

And the monk said, “Mount Lu.” For the note for this, [Yuan Wu] says, “A truthful man is hard to find.” 

“Mount Lu” means: Where do you come from, Katagiri? I come from Japan. 

But within this word, it’s pretty hard to find a truthful man. [It’s] just like the form of dance. Within the form of dance, it’s pretty hard to see [what] the beauty of the real dance is. You can never touch it. But beyond your speculation, the beauty of the so-called dance is *something* more than the form of dance. The form of dance is appearing and disappearing; it’s not the real art. The real art is pretty hard to find within the form of dance. But without the form of dance, you cannot perform the dance! So you have to do it. In order to perform dance, simultaneously there is the form of dance. 

But unfortunately, the form of dance is nothing but impermanence. So, it’s appearing and disappearing. You have to see something more than the form of dance. We always say that is called the beauty of art. But what do we mean, the beauty of art? Anyway, if you perform dance, you have to perform dance on the basis of this beauty of art. And then at that time, the form of dance becomes really beautiful. If you forget this point, the form of dance is just the form of dance. It doesn’t make sense. 

So, the monk said, “Mount Lu.” That means, “from Japan.” “Are you a ballerina?” – Yes, sir. – “Why don’t you dance?” – Yes, I do just the performance. But within this performance of dance, it’s pretty hard to find the truth. 

##### 19:31

> Yang Shan said, “Did you visit Five Elders Peak?”  
>
>> He uses the wind to fan the fire. How could he have ever passed it by?

Yang Shan said, “Did you visit Five Elders Peak?” The note for this says, “He uses the wind to fan the fire. How could he have ever passed it by?”

“He uses the wind to fan the fire” means it’s not a special technique to find the truthful man, so-called artist, so-called dancer. No, [particular things aren’t necessary]. It’s pretty easy to find [...] the truthful man of dance; it is just like fanning a fire with wind.

“How could he have ever passed it by?” You are never lost as to what to do. If you want to know the real beauty of art, just perform a dance! It’s very simple. There is no way to be at a loss what to do. 

I said before that life is like a falling maple leaf, showing the back and showing the front. Someone asked for a calligraphy about death, because I wrote already about life. I said yes, but I didn’t know what to say about death, so I had to think about it for a couple of days. And then I got a good idea, because it is a pair of calligraphies, so I said, “A falling maple leaf never fails to fall.” Do you understand? *[He chuckles.]* That is death. That is performing dance, anyway. This is also life itself. No way to escape. 

If you want to know true art, so-called dance, you should perform dance. During the performing of dance, there is no way to fail to perform the dance. Exactly right in the middle of performing dance, you just perform. [There is] no mistake. That is “He uses the wind to fan the fire”: very simple ways. 

If you want to know the meaning of happiness, and enlightenment, et cetera, what is it? Do you have to do something particular? Yes, sometimes – if you have a chance to do something particular apart from daily life, it’s fine. But you should remember there are some individuals who cannot have enough time to do something particular apart from daily life. Most people make every possible effort to live everyday life. Through everyday life, still there is a wonderful chance to know the truthful man. That’s why [Yun Men says,] “How could he have ever passed it by?” There is no way to be at a loss of what to do; just perform. Just wash your face; just get up in the morning. 

##### 25:25

> The monk said, “I didn’t get there.”  
>
>> Take a step. A red face is not as good as honest speech. He seems to be at a loss.

Next, the monk says, “I didn’t get there.” Traditionally, probably we expect some particular answer to this question. But this monk says “I didn’t get there”: he answers in the usual way. That’s why the note says, “Take a step.” “Why don’t you take a step” means why don’t you answer in a little bit different way. 

For instance, if this moment Yang Shan asked, “Did you climb elders peak,” maybe you could say… well, this is not exactly an answer, okay? *[He chuckles.]* But maybe you could say, “I have nothing to do with Amitābha Buddha, so I don’t want to see him.” If you say so, [you may have] many pretty interesting stories [about that]. So Yang Shan could say, could encourage himself to talk with him, but he didn’t say so, so he said, “I didn’t get there.” Yang Shan seems to be very bored. He seems to be disappointed, anyway. And he seems that he didn’t know what to do with ... He expects maybe some good answer, but the monk didn’t. That’s why it says “Take a step, why don’t you?” And “A red face is not as good as honest speech. He seems to be at a loss.” ... “A red face is not as good as honest speech.” But still you’re pretty good, because this note says, you’d better be honest. And not put disgrace on himself. If he says, “I have nothing to do with Amitābha Buddha so I don’t want to see him,” if he said in that way, maybe he could put disgrace upon himself, you know? In other words, he made a mistake, and he would be beaten by this Zen Master. So that’s why he says “A red face is not as good as honest speech.” Anyway you are you, so don’t imitate others. You must be you. Be honest. 

“He seems to be at a loss” means he seems to forget to have visited this mountain. Who knows, maybe he had visited this mountain, be said, “I didn’t get there.” This not says, “He seems to forget to have visited there.” So a little bit – not exactly criticism – first he criticize, and picks him up, “You’re a good boy.” Take a step means big bow, pick up him sand says, “Pretty good, you’re honest.” That’s what this note says. 

In the relationship with people, you cannot always criticize somebody, you cannot always put somebody down. If you criticize somebody, that’s alright, but the next moment you should see some good aspect of human life, and praise him or her. That’s good for you. But usually we don’t. If you see the criticism, you just criticize somebody. You forget to praise somebody. So this note puts him down first, and then praises him, or praises him first, then puts him down. That’s pretty good. It means you have to see the total picture of human life. 

##### 31:39

> Yang Shan said, “You never visited the mountain at all.”
> 
>> Too much ado! He should be careful of his eyebrows. What is this old fellow’s hurry?

And then Yang Shan said, “You never visited the mountain at all.” The note says, “Too much ado! He should be careful of his eyebrows. What is this old fellow’s hurry?”

 “You never visited the mountain at all” means “too much ado.” It is said I didn’t get there, I have never been there. It is alright. Because he’s already living in Japan, so if Katagiri lives in Japan, Katagiri’s life is encompassed by Mount Fuji. Even though I have never visited there, my life is Mount Fuji anyway. So he points out just a form of dance. “Your form of dance is pretty good.” So next form of dance is not good. So you pick up a form of dance. This monk saying “I didn’t get there” means ... and then the teacher says, “Oh, you have never visited there.” That means for instance according to the dance. How do you like you dance? You say, “I didn’t feel good.” “Oh, you didn’t feel good, huh? So you made a mistake.” That’s just like this conversation. 

Strictly speaking, if you don’t feel good, that’s from your dance, so that’s good enough. *Didn’t feel good* is also part of performance of dance. So you should appreciate it, and you should pay attention to it. The point is, through the performance of dance what we have to do is to pay attention to the real beauty of art. Within the real beauty of art, there is a mystery called performance of dance, there is a perfect performance of dance, for both incomplete or complete dance. And then you pick up one: incomplete dance. This is just a kind of one pick up and see his dance in a certain angle. If you pick me up, so-called Katagiri and Zen teachers, and then Katagiri is who? Katagiri is Japanese. So you understand this Zen teacher from such an angle, so-called Japanese. Or, you say that ... Katagiri is pretty good, so you praise Katagiri biologically, but that is not the real understanding of Katagiri’s existence, because you understand Katagiri from a certain angle, so-called biography. So in Zen within this conversation, what they want to do is pay attention to the real beauty of art. Real beauty of art in human life. For this, how do we know? If you say, “Your dance is pretty good,” this is also “too much ado.” Or you say, “not good,” this is also too much ado. So if you really want to educate somebody as a dance, basically you need great compassion, accepting both incomplete dance and complete dance. 

So that’s why this note says, “too much ado.” He should be here for his ... so you have to say carefully. Or whatever you say. But its pretty hard for us to pick up the real truth, real beauty of art. So how can you pick up the real beauty of art, so-called dance. 

“What is this old fellow’s hurry?” Why is it you hurry to say something?

> (Later,) Yun Men said, “These words were all for the sake of compassion; thus they had a conversation in the weeds.”  
> 
>> The sword that kills people, the sword that gives people life. Two, three. If you want to know the mountain road, you must be the man who travels on it.

So next, Yun Men said, “These words were all for the sake of compassion; thus they had a conversation in the weeds.” The note says, “The sword that kills people, the sword that gives people life. Two or three. If you want to know the mountain road, you must be the man who travels on it.”

Yun Men said, “These words were all for the sake of compassion”. Usually according to tradition, within such a usual conversation, but then sometimes giving ... hitting the monks, pretty dramatic way of showing there, at this stage of conversation between the monks and the teachers. If Yang Shan were Rinzai or ... , probably he would give a big blow to him. But anyway, Yang Shan is very patient to say to give an answer to his question. He kept the conversation in the usual way. So that’s why Yun Men said, “These words were all for the sake of compassion”. It was really compassionate. He is just compassionate but also his compassion points out that we should know something more than the usual conversation, more than behind the words. That’s why “The sword that kills people, the sword that gives people life.” If you are ready to accept the usual conversation as just the usual conversation, your life is just usual life. But from your usual life, maybe if you’re ready to see something more than usual life through the usual conversation, probably you’re pretty good. So that means it makes your life alive, maybe one or two. Katagiri’s life is one, but in this all life make my life one life or two life or three lives, four lives. Means to make my life fully. Something more than my thought of my capability I believe. Anyway I can make it, I can create my life, one or two or three of four or five, in my whole life. If you are ready to see something more than usual life, usual conversation. Then that means... It depends on you, how you kill your life, how you give life to you.

“If you want to know the mountain road, you must be the man who travels on it.” If you want to climb the mountain, you must be the man right on the road in the mountains. That means you must be one with the mountains. This is the first thing important for us. And then you can have a conversation with somebody. For instance, if you want to swim in the ocean, first of all you must be right in the midst of the ocean. You must be one with the water. And then you can perform the dance, so-called called to swim, or not to swim. Even not to swim is brought into existence, because it exists in the vastness of the ocean, becoming one with the water. So whatever you say: do you swim? yes. Are you not swimming? Whatever you say. Those two ideas exist in the one and the same and one with water. So already you are one. You must be one. That is a point which your universal life is supported by. And then you can pick a form; so-called swim or not swim. Good, or bad. Performing dance or not performing dance, et cetera. 

You must be the man who travels on it. You have to do it, always. And then you can learn. When you are in the ocean, you cannot stop your life. So you have to be always active in the ocean, because you are already one with the ocean, so ocean and you are connected with each other, working dynamically, so you cannot stop acting anyway. So just for standing up in the water, it is also ... without swimming, just standing up, this is ... Or sleeping on the surface of the water, it is also active. Or screaming in the ocean, “What’s happening?” Anyway, you have to act. 

In order to act, you have to pick a certain form. That is the form of swimming. Through the form of swimming, then you can ask. But within the form of swimming, its very impermanent beings, creatures, appearing and disappearing. Sometimes you suffer from the form of swimming. But you have to take care of those forms with your best. But we should know what is real beauty of the form of swimming; that means oneness with the ocean. At that time, form of swimming becomes beautiful, as art. Otherwise the form of swimming is very dreary and meaningless. 

*[Tape change.]* 

For instance, if you fall in love with somebody, you really hang on to him or her. But if you don’t, even though see a really beautiful man, still you can handle him just as a person, beyond a man or a woman. That is so-called compassion. Compassion ... In equal attitude. That’s pretty hard, but this is important. Basically we can do it. 

I took an example, sometimes, mothers’ life toward her child. She scold him or her, but still on the basis of her life, there is compassion, accepting the children’s entire life. Whatever he or she does, accepting totally. This is compassion. The mother doesn’t know this sometimes, but this is really human warmness. 

##### 

**Question**: I have a question. What if you really have a strong feeling about somebody, and you really don’t like that person or something, and that’s the feeling that you feel. How can you be compassionate?

**Katagiri**: Well, compassion is not something you try, but compassion is your consciousness. Attitude is important. If you see somebody you don’t like, at that time immediately you continually stumble over and fall down on the ground constantly, but still human nature is not something like that. Human consciousness always catches one thing and evaluates, judges, and then the next thing. Afflictive preferences come up, and then you stumble over, by afflictive preferences. On and on like that. So basically we have to be compassionate means, whoever they are, we try to do this. Even through consciousness. You have to train your consciousness like this. 

**Same person**: I guess you know what ... what happens to me is... maybe there’s somebody that I don’t like, but somebody says something to me or does something to me that makes me... its almost like its not a conscious reaction, its like I get very angry and something sort of overpowers me, it’s not something that I really think about. When I think about it and I think “this is really dumb that you’re getting this way,” but anyway that feeling still exists. 

**Katagiri**: Sure. What do you think about that? Do you think that is instinct? Maybe you can say instinct, but human instinct is a little different from animals’ instinct. Still you can control, don’t you think so? Human instinct appears under certain circumstances, so if you are training your consciousness, your body, your mind, everyday life, instinct doesn’t appear sometimes; you can control [it]. So you cannot say always there is an unconscious feeling there is coming up; most people pay attention to this kind of emotional feelings which seem to be important, but what would you call this kind of thing? Of course it is [important], but it is not completely beyond control, it is still something under your control. Control means be intimate and taking care of it. Whatever kind of name you put on it, *instinct* or *intuition*, *unconscious feeling* or *unconscious emotion*, whatever it is, it is still something under your control, okay? Don’t you think so?

**Same person**: So in other words the way to be compassionate in that situation is really a conscious response, right? You have kind of consciously process it and say, “Now, [self], shut up.” You know? I mean it seems like it not something I feel at a deep level; I just can’t let it go. 

**Katagiri**: If you say, “Shut up, [self],” that is already you are taking it very seriously. It’s not necessary to say “shut up, [self]”. Why don’t you just pass by it, anyway? That’s all. As simple as ... you have to do. You make it bigger by saying something [like], “Hey, shut up.” [Or] “you should shut up because Katagiri said so,” et cetera. But that is already extra. If you say so you already add something to it, making it bigger. So, even though you want to say so, keep your mouth shut. *[He laughs.]* Anyway pass by, as simple as you can, in many ways. You should find a skillful way; I don’t know how, because it’s case-by-case. It means, don’t take it seriously sometimes, because there are many small things in human life. But we always make it bigger, and by making small things bigger, then increase the bigger problems. But if you handle and deal with it as simple as you can, you can keep it small. 

For instance, let’s imagine I see somebody on the street by chance. I don’t like him or her. At that time, immediately, what should I do? Why don’t you just go? If I have to say good morning I have to say good morning, but if it is not necessary to say good morning, I can just pass by. Anyway, let’s imagine I would have to say “good morning” to him or her, but at time she or he doesn’t respond to me. Then, I become mad at him or her. Well, if he or she doesn’t respond, .. me. That’s alright. You just pass by. But if we’re really mad at this kind of thing, and always we keep this madness for long, even though you go home still your emotion is burning inside, that is really making small things bigger. So there are many small things; you cannot handle many small things making them bigger. You will be exhausted.

So many times you can see somebody who doesn’t respond; that’s alright. That’s a small thing. But when you have to do it, just say good morning. That’s enough. 

But if it is important thing you have to do, but when, how you should say so, well this is also a question. 

##### 

**Question**: Why did Yun Men say it was “a conversation in the weeds”?

**Katagiri**: Oh, the weeds, I’m sorry. Weeds means the phenomenal world; human life. 

In the practice there are two normal ways of practice. One is going up, which means seeking for the truth. Seeking for the truth means being free from, to be liberated from any kind of ideas and thoughts and human life. That is constantly way-seeking mind. That is one way. The other way is you cannot always do practice just like this, because you have to take care daily routine, daily life, so you have to descend to the human world. That means, “conversation in the weeds”. 

Real truth cannot be elucidated directly, but indirectly you can do it. That is through the form of dance, the form of your life, form of washing your face, form of gassho... anyway, though this, you can do it. But that real truth is not something different from the form of life or dance; it’s exactly one. If I explain this in words, always there is gap, you know, because this is a characteristic of language. It’s pretty hard to explain directly, exactly oneness itself. So this is nothing but the practice itself. 

**Same person**: On page 212 [it says]:

> But tell me, how is it that there was a conversation in the weeds for the sake of compassion? It was nevertheless dangerously steep; getting to this realm, only this fellow could hold up. This monk had personally come from Mount Lu; why did (Yang Shan) then say, “You have never visited the mountain”?

I guess there are a lot of questions in there. Why was it dangerously steep? Why could only this fellow hold up?

**Katagiri**: Oh, I see here, “dangerously steep”. Dangerously steep means it’s very tricky; not tricky, very delicate. If you attach even a little bit to the form of the dance, it’s already nothing but the impermanence, so it’s pretty hard to see the real beauty of the arts in it, because it’s appearing and disappearing. So behind this one we ... real beauty of arts. But how can you know? without the performance of dance, you cannot see it. So that’s why you have to perform dance. But if you attach to it, it’s nothing but impermanence. On the other hand, whether you can see the beauty of performing dance within the impermanence of performing. At that time if you touch it to the real beauty of arts, it’s also dangerous, because it is already formed by you, by your thought. That is a very dangerous, very steep. Wheels like this. *[He indicates something, and chuckles.]*

**Question**: Using the analogy of let’s say you get up in the morning and you are doing common things like brushing your teeth, washing up, it seems like it’s hard if you can’t see it as a dance or as a beautiful leaf turning both ways, there are times when it’s just drudgery, the times when you don’t see it that way, at least when I don’t see it that way. And those are the difficult times, because it seem like a dance anymore, it doesn’t seem like art. 

**Katagiri**: Sure, it’s really difficult. That’s why we have to do it, anyway. 

**Same Person**: Right, but I guess ... that’s always the most difficult point for me, and for a lot of people. If it almost seems like when you try to reason it out at that point, it never works. It’s like, sometimes i go, well I should see that as every moment is something sparkling. 

**Katagiri**: But you cannot ... all aspects of your life just like this, understanding completely, seeing the beauty of just like a dance. You cannot do your life completely like that, in that way. Look at your life so far. How do you get up in the morning so far? You see before you get up oin the morning, beautiful art of the dance here. *[Laughter.]* You cannot get up in that way. Can you get up in the morning, “It’s beautiful”? It’s too much! So immediately you become active. 

**Same Person**: You mean blaming [...] *[Laughter.]*

**Katagiri**: “Active” means you see already ... you must be you, but you cannot be you, you must be some different somebody. Do you understand? 

Well if you come after, I experience that [...] I wanted to be a Devadatta, you know who was a very bad boy, trying to kill the Buddha. So the teacher asked me to be the Buddha, but I didn’t want, so I wanted to be a Devadatta. Because I was very interested in Devadatta. So first of all, if I found out how difficult it is after ... because I have to be I, but on the other hand I cannot be I, I must be Devadata. But I cannot be a Devadatta exactly, Katagiri is still Katagiri. So I have to see Devadatta a little bit at a distance. And also you have to see yourself at a little distance. In other words, you have to ask. 

**Same Person**: But is it when you’re seeing yourself at a little distance, is that what causes ... Although you can’t help it, you just do it, that’s what happens... 

**Katagiri**: Yeah, I think so...

**Same Person**: But still is that still not necessarily ... I mean when you get to quote “enlightenment” unquote, you’re not seeing yourself at that distance anymore. Is that ...

**Katagiri**: Well you cannot be out there, anyway. *[He laughs.]* Sometimes if you become out there you are interested in your life, but sometimes you cannot be out there. You have to be just you, you know. I mean if you become an actor you always ... seeing the beauty of stuff at a distance, whatever it is, you have to be. That is an actor. But if the daily life is not like this, there is no space to be the actor. Before you want to be actor or ... well, not actor... you already act. So this is our life. So-called present. 

I understand it’s pretty hard, because getting up in the morning is a very simple practice, but if you get up in the morning at four o’clock, if you carry this practice for thirty days, a hundred days ... for instance, if you carry a small bucket of water for ten miles, twelve miles, a hundred miles, you are really exhausted. I understand that. But anyway, you have to carry it! But still, simple ways, spiritually, you can carry the small bucket of water every day, you feel it.
