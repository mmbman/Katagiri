... Page 89, Chapter 2: *Prajna*. 

> The following day, at the invitation of Magistrate Wei, the Master took his seat and said to the great assembly, “All of you purify your minds and think about Maha Prajna Paramita.”

Look at page 40 in the sutra: 

> The Great Master said to the assembly, “Good Knowing Advisors, the self-nature of Bodhi is originally clear and pure. Simply use that mind, and you will straightaway accomplish Buddhahood. Good Knowing Advisors, listen while I tell you about the actions and intentions by which Hui Neng obtained the Dharma.”

I think it here [where] it says, “Good Knowing Advisors, the self-nature of Bodhi is originally clear and pure. Simply use that mind, and you will straightaway accomplish” the buddha way, that teaching is connected with this first paragraph of the sutra in Chapter 2, Prajna: “the Master took his seat and said to the great assembly, ‘All of you purify your minds...’”

“Purify your minds” means own being, means self-nature. Self-nature is clear and pure originally. That’s why you have to use this mind directly, straighforwardly, “straighaway,” without inserting any defilement. And then accomplish buddhahood. That is his teaching: purify your mind, and think about *maha prajna*. You have to think about that wisdom, *prajnaparamita*. 

I think *prajna* can be considered in terms of three points. 

One point is the essence of prajna, the essence of wisdom. The essence of wisdom is the self nature is originally pure and clean. This is the essence of *prajnaparamita*.

And the function of *prajnaparamita* is... how can I say. In *Fukanzazengi,* Dogen Zenji [says], “Learn the backward step that turns your light inwardly to illuminate yourself.” This is the function of the *prajna*. 

I think the essence of prajna is the self nature is originally clean and pure. That’s why if wisdom works, nothing to bring in from outside. So you have [it] already. So if you return to original nature of existence, it simultaneously illuminates. So if you come back, you illuminate. In other words, if you come back to original nature of existence, you can experience the religious transformation at 360 degrees: exactly turn over. That is *illuminate*.

So no one helps you. If you practice sincerely, more or less everyone experiences this 180 degree or 360 degree turn-over. 

Well, there are many kinds of experience. Some experience this very slowly, very slowly. And some experience a little shock. Some experience nothing – but it’s penetrating, soaking through, just like rain soaking through the ceiling, something like that. They don’t realize, but it’s soaking through. 

Sometimes, some experience a *big* shock, you know? Like thunder, lightning, exactly. Zen teaching is always talking about such experience: fascinating experience. But not everyone, okay? 

So, many kinds of experience. But more or less, people can turn over their lives 180 degrees, if you really come back to original nature. That is how. This is zazen we do. 

That is “turn your light inwardly to illuminate yourself” that Dogen Zenji mentions in [*Fukanzazengi*].

And the third point is, *essential principle*. Essential principle of prajna is *nondualism*. Nondualism is there are two, but not two, they are one. But not one exactly – they are two. So you cannot say anything. They are two, but it’s not two, it’s one. 

So if you explore thoroughly anything – human beings, human mind, or tables, floors – I think you cannot pin down anything at all. You cannot put that name on it. So very naturally if you touch *A*, *A* turns into *B*, simultaneously. So just like a quark: I mention, quarks are tiny, tiny beings – atoms, the particles. It has five “flavors”. But one flavor is not the usual flavor: if you say “ugly,” it immediately turns in “beauty.” So a scientist says, “it’s ugly,” but if you touch it, immediately it’s beautiful. So it’s the front, simultaneously it’s the back. So you cannot say. There are two? No – it’s one. But it’s not one, it’s two. 

This is undefiled state of existence. Or sometimes we say, “pure and clean.” And philosophically we say *nondualism*. Something like that. 

Or truth and the phenomenal world [are] not two, but not one. If you say one, it’s dualistic one. You [mix] up. 

For instance, I was pretty often asked by the Christian people, “Do you believe [in] God?” If I say, “Yes,” already that God is something considered in terms of [dualism]. And if I say “no,” it’s already dualistic understanding, so I accept God dualistically. Because if I say “God is one,” immediately I say “God is one,” but that God is already in front of me! Or I say “God and believers,” or, “believers and object.” People can believe. It’s already dualistic. But God is something one with us, or all beings. So already it’s dualistic, so no matter how long you discuss, endlessly. But God is something more than whether you can believe or you don’t believe. Something more than that. So you don’t say anything. But you have to say [something] about God. So what is a belief? What do you mean by belief, believing? 

So nondualism is you have to be very careful to deal with, or to live in the nondualistic world. It really depends on your activities. It’s not ideas. 

So, that is *prajna*. That’s why prajna is very profound wisdom to look at the structure of human beings, in terms of essence, and function, and also essential principle of wisdom. You have to see the human world very clearly, so it’s not an idea or discussion, it really depends on your activity. You have to do right now, right here. Because original nature is very pure, and function is turning yourself inwardly to illuminate you. So you have to just come back. In other words, you become you, and you settle yourself, you are you-ing, and then you settle down right now. And then, you illuminate. 

That wisdom illuminates. In other words, if you want to be peaceful, *you* must be peaceful right now. How? Be peaceful. Peace is not outside. Peace is not you can get now in your hand. So with your whole body and mind, demonstrate peace, right now, right here. And then, peace illuminates peace. 

So that is called “turn yourself inwardly to illuminate.”
