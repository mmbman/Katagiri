... say something more, a little bit, about same subject, as I told yesterday. The subject was, "You must know that first, there, in zazen, the right dharma is manifesting itself, and that from the first, dullness and distraction are struck aside." I would like to explain a little more about same subject, from different angle today. Because this is very important characteristic of zazen we do, which is called shikantaza.

Briefly speaking, I told you yesterday and the day before yesterday: if you do zazen even for a moment, you become buddha. This is first impression for me when I was at Eiheiji monastery, listening to a lecture given by Hashimoto Roshi. I didn't understand the meaning, but, I was moved very much by this point. If you sit down, if you do zazen, shikantaza, even for a moment, you become buddha. I accepted (it), totally - no question. I think now, I was lucky. [mild laughter] I was lucky, anyway. If I had a big head, I couldn't accept it. But anyway, I accepted it, totally. I was lucky guy.

Particularly according to dullness and distraction; dullness and distraction here are meant to exemplify all kinds of delusion. But according to Abidharma-kosha, dullness and distraction are just one of the delusions. ([Abhidharmakośa on encyclopediaofbuddhism.org](https://encyclopediaofbuddhism.org/wiki/Abhidharmakośa)) So, you can find the dullness and distractions, one of the delusions according to the list of the Abidharma-kosha. Thirty-seven and thirty-eight says, dullness in Sanskrit, styāna [spells it out], this is dullness. Translation says: torpor; or stiffness, or unctuousness(?) [tries to pronounce that], and sterility(?), indifference, and in Latin, (???) [lot of hard to discern stuff here] ... languor; torpor; sloth. (Also, lethargy.)

This is dullness, and the other one is distraction. They present it as, in Sanskrit, auddhatya [spells it] - that means, restlessness. Or, agitation, restlessness of mind, reckless, or frivolity. Et cetera.

(5:19) But in Fukanzazengi, dullness and distraction mentioned by Dogen are meant to exemplify all kinds of delusions. So, if you do shikantaza, not only dullness and distraction, all kinds of delusions drop off, from the first. This is shikantaza.

First let me say a little bit about the meaning of the dullness and distraction. Broadly speaking, dullness and distraction are the state that the mind acts reactively, like the swing of a pendulum. And the body and mind lose a state of their equilibrium. That is in a state of either distraction or dullness. Just like a pendulum. 

So it is represented as kon-san(?) in Japanese. 'Kon'(?) is dullness, 'san'(?) is distraction. So according to Chinese letter, 'kon', the structure of the Chinese letter 'kon' consists of two parts. One is bottom, second is the sun. The sun sinks, or sets, at the bottom; the complete darkness.

So kon means dullness, which means the state which the mind becomes gloomy and doesn't work. As if the sun sets, and the surroundings completely become dark. That is the meaning of kon, dullness.

San is distraction. Distraction is a state that the mind is annoyed with troublesome, and is (impermanent?). That is distraction. So distraction, broadly speaking, means... what would you say, relative understanding. Various relative understanding; relative views, relative thoughts. Or, worldly thoughts. Worldly thoughts means to understand or view something in the dualistic world. That is distraction. 

So if you understand something in the dualistic world, whatever kind of things you can get, whatever kind of idea or view you can get, it's cause of distraction. For instance, good or evil, or neutral. Or had practice, or easy practice, or, so-so. Whatever kind of idea you get in the dualistic world, all becomes cause of distraction. That is really distraction. 

(10:27) There are many kinds of zazen, many types of zazen, in this world, but broadly speaking, let me say, maybe three types of zazen. 

One type of zazen is, that by zazen, we try to remove weeds on the ground, and reach certain stages of "no weeds," perfectly. No weeds, perfectly. But at any cost, by the zazen, we struggle for weeding out. And make whole world completely clean, perfectly. But that is nothing but resting weeds. Resting weeds are temporary, for certain period of time. So, someday, weeds come back, come up. Because, you cannot destroy weeds. Because weeds are nothing but being. Just like your existence. Weeds, flowers - beautiful flowers, ugly flowers, many kinds of flowers. As long as flowers exist in this world, immediately there is weeds. 

(12:45) But actually, in the dualistic world, we don't like weeds. So, with hatred, we try to cut down. But while you maintain ... hatred. But by the hatred, maybe you can cut down. [loud airplane noise] But it is not complete, (not) completely removing weeds from the human world. Sometimes, somewhere, weeds come up. [still loud airplane noise] But we can see this kind of practice in the human world. 

(13:47) For instance, business. If you learn business; well, as long as you want to learn business - restaurant or whatever - we have to develop business. You want to be successful in running business. So usually, in common sense, we really struggle for feeling successful in business. Whatever happens, stumbling over; removing the weeds and gaining the flowers, and ... in order to be successful in the business, we struggle for our lives, and reach the other shores. We can do this. 

(14:54) So, if you struggle with your whole heart, with your effort, you can do anything. If you risk your life, you can do anything. You can reach the other shore. But, if you reach the other shore, that is (not) the final goal, because the other shore is also (???). So the goal you have reached is no longer goal. Immediately, first step; you have to go into first step. You have to do something from now. Do you understand? This is very clear; this is human world. We do. 

So immediately, your goal, completely goes far from you. That's why the moment that you reach the goal, immediately you don't feel satisfied. That's why you want to do something more. So that desire is infinite; just like snowballing. And then finally, we have to die. And then, death waits for you. That's all. This is very common. Very common. But I don't know whether there is real way, or not. 

That is one type of zazen. If you do zazen like this, of course you can attain enlightenment. You can completely weed out, by arranging your physical conditions, and concentrating your breath, and adjusting or arranging your breath, taking care of your breath, well, you can reach a certain spiritual stage, which is called calmness, tranquility. Which you never see, feel, well, happy... 

But, when the circumstances are changed; well you can't accept your calmness and tranquility you have experienced; cannot maintain. Immediately, it's gone. So you are confused, very much. I know several examples in the United States. 

But at certain stage, under certain circumstances, for instance ????, or whatever. But if you are right in the middle of a monastery in dharma(?), you can follow the rules, strict practice, very much. And you attain enlightenment. But when you come to the United States - completely different situation, okay? Very different situation. And then, weeds come back. It's really simple. 

(18:58) Well, I don't mean it is good or bad, right and wrong. We should know, that is life. That is life, okay? These human beings; we should know that.

(19:15) And second type is, that we remove the roots of the weeds, and even the seeds, from the ground. Weeds no longer grow. They are completely free from samsaric world, in the Six Realms of Existence: hell, hungry ghost, titan spirit, animal spirit, human beings, heavenly beings. But unfortunately, we weed out perfectly on the ground of only our own property, and cherish a feeling of having reached the final goal. In other words, we are, by way of having done our final goal, and spent our whole life without considering others' life.

So, by the practice of zazen, it's possible to weed out even the seeds, completely, and the weeds no longer grow. That means, some Buddhism says, if you attain enlightenment, which is highest level of spiritual life, and then at that time, it's not necessary to come back to human world. You can stay constantly in the heaven.

So, arhat, and many saints in the history of Buddhism, they showed us their experience. That's why one of the four stages of the bodhisattva, of buddhist practice, arhat does, is highest spirit of spiritual life, which never sees you... never to come back to human being, samsaric world. This is arhat practice. 

This is also zazen. You can do. But that is just weeding out on their own territory. That's all. 

And then, when they completely weed out on their territory - they don't know what to do. So there is only the death to wait; that's all. So all they have to do is, just to wait - for their death. Can you imagine this? It's not necessary? If the people don't offer the food, they can survive, because they can stop their breath, for how many hours. Do you know that? Yes, they can do. Still, there is a possibility to survive. So, it's not necessary to struggle for their life. Just be there. No more weeds come up. Very clean. But, they don't know what to do. Just wait for their death, that's all. 

(24:25) Here is very good example in Japan. This is the story... one of the famous Japanese actors, who was interested in economy, business. So he cherished for a long time, some project he really wanted. So, he leaped at the chance to do this. So, he got a chance. He started to (do) that business project. Finally, he finished. Perfectly finished. Risking his whole life. He did it! Everyone respect; wonderful job, perfect. But finally, he didn't know what to do *next*. And then - can you imagine what will happen? He committed suicide. Why? He committed suicide. He must be happy, because he did it. But he committed suicide - why? People didn't understand it. 

So, that is really good example. Not only Buddhist - this is really human life. If you really want to do something, completely weed out; and you want to be successful in any kind of business, and Buddhist practice... If you want to live in paradise, you can do it. But, this is not final goal Buddha mentions. Because, if you do it, there is still confusion. You don't know what to do. Then, all you have to do is - finally, nothing to do. After reaching that highest level, nothing to do. Because that highest level is nothing but something (in) dualistic world. So, highest level is a certain level opposed to lowest level. Always dualistic world. But if you reach highest level in the dualistic world, still there is a confusion. 

(27:20) Or, another confusion is, they really are by (???) world. Having reached highest level, and having stayed with that highest level. Nothing to do. Enjoy themselves. And all they have to do is, just to wait for death. 

That is what is called dullness. In other words, too much pride. "I finished. My task is done. So, any time, any where, I can die." So, you can wait for death, in peace and harmony. Without weeds; without having the weeds. But, this is called dullness. 

Because, that high spirit is just one of the lifestyles in the dualistic world. It's not completely happiness. 

(29:00) The last type of zazen is something we do: shikantaza. 

But struggling for reaching the other shore at any cost, this is also distraction. Which is good, distraction. Even though you reach the highest level of spiritual life, still there is a struggle. Because the moment you reach the final goal, final goal cannot be (???). You have to start again. That's why struggle constantly going on. That is distraction. On the other hand, dullness.

But if you do shikantaza, dullness and distraction drop off, from the first. 

Even the karma. Karma is dead. We planted in the past. Some karmas were good. Some karmas were evil. Some karmas were neutral. Many karmas, we created in the past. And then those karmas, you know pretty well, those karmas are where? Are at the bottom of our mind. This body and mind. Karma is here. 

So, through your daily living, you can realize. Your present life are influenced by something else, which you don't understand. Well, maybe some people call it karma. Only when they realize something's wrong. Because only when you realize something's wrong, you really get the chance to reflect upon yourself very seriously. That's why you put a certain level(?) on your life, that is something wrong. That karma is "wrong". Evil karma. 

But actually, karma exists with you, is completely beyond moral sense of good or bad or neutral. 

(32:08) But. I told you very often, that karmas in the past and existing in the present in your life, appear, or don't appear, when time and occasions are ripe, and conditions are arranged. Karmas, all kinds of karmas, are still here. Nothing happens. But only when time and occasions are ripe, and conditions arranged perfectly, some karma appears. 

That is the characteristic of the karma you created in the past. That's why karmas you created in the past are completely beyond moral sense; good, or bad, neutral. So they are always there. If you don't touch it; if you don't (have) particular time and opportunity are created, or conditions are arranged. Not arranged - completely karma sits. But if you create certain conditions and time and occasion: it appears. 

So question is, how we should... what kind of time and occasion and conditions we should create. ... that's the point. He says, one of the... Keeping away, criticizing karmas you did in the past. Because, karmas in the past are completely quiet. (???) But that is, any time, anywhere, appears and disappears, according to time and occasion and conditions *you* do. Okay?

So this is karma. 

(34:45) So, point is that life is not going backward. Life must go forward. We know pretty well. In order to go forward to the future, there is no chance to discriminate, or to blame the karmas you did in the past. Because karmas are (already?) in your life. 

But karmas appear why? Because you move toward the future. You do something; you create time and place and conditions. That's why karmas appear. That means, you are alive.

So, anyway, we have to move to our future. There is no chance to blame your karmas in the past. Good or bad, right and wrong, whatever you say: karmas don't care.

And also, karmas appear, ignoring your judgement, evaluation, and hatred, dislike, whatever. Karmas appear only when time and occasion are right, and conditions arranged. It appears, even though you don't like it. That's why you are confused.

So: It is very important, what kind of time and occasion and conditions we should make, from moment to moment, in the process of moving to our future. Rather than, criticizing and blaming the karmas in the past. 

(36:52) So, important point is, that we have to create a good time and occasion, good conditions, as best as we can. If you create good time and occasion, and good conditions are created, immediately, some of the karmas in the past, which are called good, appear in the present. And, if you do it, if you have done, immediately that will be a seed of the karma which will appear in the future. So, you can always plant, sew a good seed. Because, good conditions, and good time and occasions, you create, day after day. And then, evil karmas don't have a chance to appear. But evil karmas always here, very quiet. And if you do always good karma, creating good karma, and then the evil karmas really disappear, of themselves. They lose the chance to appear. 

What is good? What is a good time and occasion, and what is a good condition; that is the point. This 'good' is not the 'good' opposed to 'evil'. That good is "super-good". The supreme good; beyond good or bad, right and wrong. Such a good seed should be stored, right now, right here, from day to day. At that time, that good seed is planted in your blood, and creates new life. 

(39:28) Recall Fukutoku-atsu(?). Fukutoku means merit and virtue. ([Fukutoku 福徳 - equivalent to Sanskrit Punya?](https://www.nichirenlibrary.org/en/dic/Content/P/131)) Suru (累積?) means to accumulate. So, to accumulate merit and virtue. That means, sew a good seed. Completely, that good seed originates from intrinsic value of pure human activities. Very pure human activities. That is fukutoku, merit and virtue. Fukutoku-atsu(?), we say. 

(40:28) But let me say about this: we don't understand. Still we don't understand, because, well, why is that dullness and distraction drop off from the first, if you accumulate merit and virtue?

In order to understand this point, first of all, we have to see practice for long range, life after life. Not only seeing your life, in your life, in your whole life - in this life, in this world. You have to see your whole life, life after life. Life after life. Maybe next life, or life after next life. Anyway, life is continually going on. Because, we created karma in the past; and also, we are creating new karma now. And then, as long as we are creating new karma from moment to moment, it means future will exist. So, you can get the chance to be born, in the next life. That is meaning of sense of ... karma. So as long as we have karma in the past and we are creating karma in this life, we have to have future. So life is going on, constantly.

So, point is, that we sew a good seed. We sew a good time and occasion, and good conditions. At that time - well, according to my talk yesterday, when good time and occasion are ripe, when good conditions are arranged, finally there is something left. That is total personality. Don't you think so? Do you remember? That's why all we have to do is, arrange. Arrange, number one, environment. Second, the sensory world. Arranged, in many ways. With careful consideration for the movement system; that is body: hands, feet, tongue; all movement system, we have to arrange. And then, finally, sit down in the proper way, immobile. Immobile state. At that time, very naturally, body can be kept. Equilibrium. And fourth, regulation (of) breath. If you regulate the breath, then naturally, regulation of the breath influences so much: the system of your hormones, and blood circulation, and also your nerve system, and internal organs. It influences very much. And also finally, regulating of the mind. Regulating mind. That is, no design of having a reward, becoming buddha; just do it. Just do it. Because, the mind has certain sticky - stuck, which is called attaching to. Attachment. If you attach (to) it, immediately there is a string between zazen and you. So you cannot cut; you cannot see the zazen clearly. So immediately there is, that is type of ...

[tape change]

(46:20) ... through regulation of body, and regulation of breath. That is what is called samadhi. Perfect samadhi. Often at that time, there is no chance to insert design of becoming buddha, or having rewards. So, very pure. There is something left, which is called intrinsic value of pure human activity. Just do. That is total personality. Psychologically speaking, that is total personality.

You cannot get the total personality without arranging, number one, circumstances, environment, and sensory world, and movement system, and brain system, and nervous system, and internal organs. Without this, you cannot do it! So how can you get touch; how can you touch the core of your life, which is called total personality? Extending to the past, extending to the future; that is total personality. Completely beyond human speculation and judgement. How can you touch? We don't know. Because too many circumstances, environment. Environment, sensory world, movement system, nervous system, brain system, and many things, internal organs.

So, first of all, "let's sew the good seed" means, completely beyond good or bad, right and wrong, according to common sense. That means, let's make arrangement of number one, number two, number three, number four, number five. And then, finally, something left. That is total personality, which is called buddha nature. Appears very naturally. 

(48:46) (I'll share) this good example. I know a gentleman, I forgot his name. He has particular job: he was a commando. Do you know that (word)? Commmando is one of the soldiers hired by government. But that commando, his task is, well, very hard. Not exactly same, but sort of a spy. Sort of spy, but not exactly spy. I forgot one of the long stories in England - you can see, I saw the pictures on the TV probably. The host, the man in this novel, was just like a commando. So, the government asked him to do something; secret task. You have to go to the other country, immediately, by the order of the government, and then serve somebody, who could be killed, or who could be arrested. Whatever happens, anyway, he has to do. That is a commando; he does. He is very sharp, very sharp, and his eyes, very sharp eyes. If you look at him, immediately he glares at you. [chuckles] Just like a frog in front of a snake. Can you imagine? Because he has to maintain continually a certain mental, psychological tension. No seam, crack, psychological crack, between him and object. Always there is no crack. So he's very sharp.

But he suffered a lot. And he likes very much here. He likes very much. So he came single time to see me, and he sat a few times here. He was here, but he doesn't have a particular home. Every day, he has to move. He has to do something secretly. He wants to come here, but, the government, FBI, everybody, follows him. So he cannot walk in sunshine. He has to walk in the darkness. He wants to come here because zazen starts in the dark. [laughter] So, in the morning - that's why he wanted to come. He came once. And he had a small passport. That passport is completely special, special passport issued by the government. This is a secret passport. Any time, any where, he can go. Any place. At any time, any where, he can kill anybody. [some laughter] That means, he is also, any time, any where, killed by somebody. Don't you think so? That is his job. Any time.

And also, if he killed somebody, his task is successful. And government gives a (???) to him. He doesn't want government, FBI, to look for him. Always, look for him. But he came here. And then I asked, "I give a Buddha statue." (A statue) carved in ivory, from India. So that is wonderful, the Buddhist statue. Somebody gave me, so I gave it to him, "Please keep this." And I told him about this Buddhist statue: "Can you feel something?" Or I showed him the bodhisattva picture, sitting like this. Do you know the picture? Miracle bodhisattva in Japan, one of the national treasures. I told him, because I want to know his soft, gentle mind; so,"How do you feel there?" He said, "No, I don't like." "How come?" He said, "He's a strict teacher." Maybe so, maybe so. And also, that's based on... "How about this? Do you feel something quiet, calmness?" He said, "No." "How come?" "He's too (soft?)" I think so. He's very sharp. Because Kannon Bodhisattva is, anyway, Kannon Bodhisattva - Avalokiteshvara - showing Buddha's compassion. That is a complete cure; what is called buddha nature. But we cannot touch it directly. That's why, how can we touch it, that buddhas compassion, or buddha nature? So, let's touch. That's buddha's compassion through human shape. That is Bodhisattva. That's why Avalokiteshvara has double face: human body, and also on the other hand, compassion. That's why he sees suffering. To see suffering is Avalokiteshvara. Of course. That is human. Without a human body, a human shape, we cannot find any way to touch buddha's compassion. That is art of Buddhist statue. So we have to see the double face. 

(56:42) So, nothing he likes here. I point out, "How about this?" or "How about that?" He doesn't like anything. So finally, right before he left, he stand up here, and he said, "Only this place is very calm. No sitting here. No sitting here. No there. Only I am here." He said to me, "Only this place makes me calm. Return to human." Can you imagine?

That means... that's why environment - environment, making arrangement of the environment, and also sensory world, and also brain system, and movement system, and also internal organs, all things arranged perfectly; at that time, immediately, he can feel calm. The moment he feels calm, that means dullness and distraction drop off. From the first. Don't you think so? Yes, it is.

Not only dullness and distraction. All delusions drop off. "Drop off" doesn't mean destroy. Just drop off; there's no chance to poke their head into someplace. Just, keep quiet. 

So, for instance, as long as he is standing here, feeling quiet, no one can hit him. I don't want to hit him. Even though an FBI person came, I told him, "Just wait a minute. I can tell him." Even the FBI cannot hit him, because he feels calm. Even though he get angry with me, I just sit down here and gassho. Can you hit me? Or, I smile to you - while I am smiling to you, (can you) hit me? No. So finally you smile, you smile too. That means, anger drops off. Anger drops off, while you are smiling. 

(59:40) So, little boys... In Green Gulch, during the mealtime, we shouldn't say anything, so, everybody quiet. Kids' delusions drop off very naturally. The moment when they came in and cleaned out the dining room, all delusions drop off. So, they keep quiet. That's interesting.

And then, during the meal, the ino hit the one clapper [clap]; that means the sign of starting talk, giving the permission to talk. Hit the clapper once. Immediately a little boy: "Hi." [laughs] Immediately he said to me, "Hi." So I said, "Hi." [laughter] This is very interesting.

(1:00:46) So that's why this is... we don't know how much delusions drop off. No, we don't realize, we don't perceive, how much ... Because, the dropping off is possible only when you fit right now right here, karma. At that time, no delusions come up. 

So, immediately you are right in the middle of total personality. You can manifest yourself just like a watersprout, blooming. But you don't perceive. And also, we don't know how much, what it is; we don't realize. Because, too quick. Simultaneous. 

That is seed. Sew good seed. Good time and occasion, and good conditions, we can create, right now, right here.

That's why shikantaza is not a means to an end, leading here and to reach the other shore, struggling for getting enlightenment, et cetera. This is fine. Well this is very nice; this is a kind of zazen. So, you can do this. But, while you are struggling for - it is nothing but distraction. Don't you think so? This is very true. Distraction. Why don't you deal with it? ...

Now also, on the other hand, I told you, you can completely clean your whole life, weeds no longer grows. But, after reaching that stage, you don't know what to do. So all you have to do is, just wait for the death. That's why the Japanese actor committed suicide. It's not necessary to commit suicide, but he did it. Why? 

Because, whatever it is, all things are completely delusions, created in the dualistic world. In the dualistic world, if you say "good," you are really holding this. But on the other hand, evil comes up. So, you don't like the evil, you like the good, but, evil and good, immediately evil comes up, and then immediately you try to move to the other place. So always going this way, that way, going that way. That's why, pendulum. Distraction and dullness is that life moves reactively, just like a pendulum, going to the right, to the left. Constantly, no end. 

(1:04:30) If you want to stop it, we have to sew a good seed. Right now, right here, that is, we have to create good time and occasion, and good conditions arranged. That's all we have to do. That is freedom. Anyone can do. Even though you are not Buddhist, or even though you cannot come here, you can sit down, arrange your room, and arrange circumstances, environment, and your sensory world, and breathing, and internal organs, and, you can sit down. Don't you think so? This is shikantaza. Just ... your environment, everything. And then, that's all we have to do. This is freedom, open to everybody. No exceptions. 

That's why Dogen Zenji says, Universal recommendation for zazen. Universal recommendation. It's real universe. Not only weeding out on your own territory. Anyone can do it. Wherever you may be, you can do it. 

But, if you do it by yourself, it's pretty hard. Because, making arrangement is done by your sense. That's all. But first of all, by your effort, by your sense, by your understanding, do your best to make arrangement of all circumstances. Including environment, outwardly or inwardly. Inwardly means sensory world, movement system, internal organs, and also brain and nervous system. We have to arrange, according to a certain way. And then if our environments, inwardly and outwardly, are arranged perfectly, immediately, there is a blossom which blooms. That is total personality. Buddha nature. At that time, very naturally, all delusions drop off. Just like a lotus flower blooms through muddy water.

(1:07:26) While lotus flower blooming, muddy water exists. But it doesn't bother us. It's really appreciated. Lotus flowers, just bloom. And then, mud water drops off, very naturally, and then whole lotus flowers bloom in the universe. 

That is shikantaza. And then if you do this, that practice creates merit and virtue, which bloom in the future. In the life after next life, it's blooming. Yes it is. I promise. I promise.

And then, this way is exactly cut off karma, stream of karma. Without this, nothing else to cut off karma. This is the best way. But we don't know. We really want to... we are always curious of, poking our head into a certain hole, always. That is a dualistic world, okay? Anyway, stop it. If you stop, everything comes up, very naturally, passing by you.

(1:09:05) So all you have to do is, you cannot ignore all circumstances, environment, outwardly, inwardly. So, take care, with your best; everything. And then, stop it there. Just like a statue. He doesn't feel anything; peaceful from anything. Even a buddha statue. But he seems... He feels calm.

That is very important. At that time, completely his... all delusions drop off. 

This is shikantaza. So, shikantaza is arrangement of, and then, sit down. That's all. This is really Bodhisattva path, to help all sentient beings. If you practice this, your life really help you, for you, and for others. It is very true. Even though you don't say, somebody realize. You have something to tell him, or her. 

That is shikantaza. It's pretty difficult to understand for us, intellectually. Because we are getting the use of, always analyzing, criticizing, everything, in the dualistic world. It's very difficult to stop immediately. That's why even though you stop for a while, you don't appreciate that practice. But this practice is only the best way. 

That is shikantaza. Shikantaza, zazen you do, mentioned by buddha. We can explain how important this kind of buddhist practice, philosophically, psychologically. But it takes time. That is huge world; philosophical background, psychological background. But even though you don't know, you can do, right now, right here. This is a very urgent need; we have to do. Whoever you are, wherever you may be, you can do it. For instance, if you are in an office - well, still you can do. If somebody, and no one there, you can sit down in a chair and calm yourself. If you talk between somebody, you can realize a certain pause, where no words come up. At that time, you can return to yourself, and breathe. 

(1:12:30) You can do it, okay? So wherever you may go; it's really universal. Very simple. It's too simple to realize. But, this is the best way. Not only for your life in this world; in the next life, in the life after next life, after next next life. Continually. That is to accumulate merit and virtue. That practice is really just, sew the seeds. Sew the seeds. Arrangement circumstances, environment, inwardly, outwardly, and just stand up there, that's all. That's all you have to do. That is to sew good seeds. Good time and occasion, good conditions must be arranged. Then, stand up there. That's all we have to do. And then, at that time, right dharma is manifest. Dogen Zenji says, right dharma is manifesting itself, and that from the first, dullness and distraction are struck aside. 

That's why when I was at Eiheiji monstery, Hashimoto Roshi said, "If you sit down even for a moment, you become buddha." Yes, you become buddha. If you can accept this, your are really lucky man, lucky person.

(1:14:35) Okay, do you have... Shall I discuss now, or tomorrow? If you have some questions. Tomorrow, of course, I want to have a chance to discuss with you about this. Or now.

*Question*: Roshi, what's the difference between the second kind and the third kind, if our goal becomes to do shikantaza. Isn't that the same thing? 

*Katagiri*: What is the ... ?

*same person*: You said there are three types of zazen. I didn't understand the difference between the third one and the second one, if ... to do shikantaza becomes our goal. 

*Katagiri*: No. Our aim is not focused on goal. Goal is goal; we know goal. Goal is just image of the goal, because we don't reach yet. In order to reach the goal, all we have to do is, what? Take one step. 

*same person*: Okay, to be present.

*Katagiri*: To be present, yes.

*same person*: Well isn't that a goal? 

*Katagiri*: It's goal, and also practice. Goal and practice, simultaneously. Be present, just be present. But just be present, many kinds of way of being just present. Because everybody has a different idea. Sleeping all day, this is also be just present. Don't you think so? Doing zazen every day, all day, this is also just be present. Old men fighting with each other all day, this is also just be present. Don't you think so?

*same person*: No. 

*Katagiri*: Well, many ways of existence.

*same person*: That's not what I meant. 

*Katagiri*: You don't understand the second one and the third one. 

*same person*: Well it seems to me that the third one is the true nature of the second one. Even if you try to do the second one, you have to do the third one, because as soon as you're going over, there's another one. 

*Katagiri*: Okay, yes. I understand your question. Yes.

It seems the buddha nature of the second one. But, it is still seen from dualistic world. That's all. That's a different point.

(1:18:00): *Question*: Roshi, were you making a distinction between the enlightenment of the arhat versus the enlightenment of the bodhisattva? Doesn't the arhat attain enlightenment, and can then enter nirvana, but does it for himself or herself, while the bodhisattva, at the point of enlightenment, refuses to enter it unless all sentient beings go along with it. Is there a distinction there? Sometimes in literature, you see a distinction; the bodhisattva ideal being the higher ideal to attain. Was that what you were trying to say? 

*Katagiri*: Uh, bodhisattva practice, yes. ... Because bodhisattva says, without re-entering nirvana, they really want to save we the peoples to enter nirvana. That means, his practice is really open, not only to him, but also to all sentient beings, and also the time. Not only his present time, but also his past life, and also his future life, and also his life after next, and after next. 

Then what he has to do is, well, but he practices. Continually, he practices. But aim just to sew good time and occasion, and good conditions. Arrangement. 

(1:19:55) That means, without entering nirvana. Bodhisattva just sews, arranging environment. And then just stand up there. But it is, immediately blooms his buddha nature. That is (???) The bodhisattva has (???) Bodhisattva and buddha.

When the buddha appears, it's quiet. Nothing. You cannot see it. But a buddha is hidden behind the bodhisattva; bodhisattva walks, as a human being. Bodhisattva disappears, and buddha appears. And then that buddha is just like a blooming lotus flower. In the mud water.

*same person*: But is the bodhisattva practice of the third kind? 

*Katagiri*: Mmm hmm. Sure. Yes it is.

(1:21:10) *Question*: Roshi, is the difference between the second and the third, then, that the second one, there is a goal, and the third, there is in a sense no goal?

*Katagiri*: The goal in third type of zazen is broad. It's really broad. That goal is not open to him, his practice, and also to others practice. 

*same person*: It's not open?

*Katagiri*: It is open to everybody. Everybody's goal. And also, it's open to not only the present, but also past, present, and future. For long range. The goal is extended through the three times. It's huge. That's why, we cannot get such a huge goal. Because it's too big. But, we are such a huge goal. So, such a huge goal. So, how can I say? Let's... that for a huge goal blooms with your life. How? Making arrangement of environment. 

So finally, third type of zazen doesn't have a goal. We can say so. But it doesn't mean no goal. There is a goal, but that goal is broad, huge. But second type of zazen, goal is limited by individual views and thoughts. 

So, according to his life, of course, his task, his business, is (to) succeed. Of course. But I don't know whether it is good for others. So finally, he doesn't know what to do next. 

(1:24:12) [quietly] Are there any (more) questions?

*Question*: So what is the practice of the arhat, roshi? When he's already arhat, what is his practice? You said he just waits for death, but he has to practice something. 

*Katagiri*: Oh. Of course. Waiting for death is also practice for you.

*same person*: Well, I don't know, of course, but it seems like if a person practices so that he or she becomes an arhat, automatically it must move to the third type.

*Katagiri*: Oh, of course, this is... Yes. Automatic.

*same person*: So it can't stay the same.

*Katagiri*: Not automatic, sometimes. [chuckles] Not automatic. No.

It's not open to everybody. Only the person selected among the human beings can do this, automatically. You can get into the third type of zazen practice, that is, you can do. But not everybody. Because everybody has different karmas. But, it is not the object of criticism, given by us. Because, if I look his life in this world, his life is happy, wonderful, because he entered nirvana; wonderful. So, better than nothing. Wonderful. If you can attain, enter nirvana, drinking just one cup of juice every day: wonderful. And you can wait for death, peacefully: wonderful. It's very wonderful. 

So not only there is no chance to come back to samsaric world. So, just a river(?). Practicing, waiting for death. But a bodhisattva and tathagata are a little different.

***Question***: What about Doctor Jules Fox(?), Roshi? Based on what you were saying about karma, and dropping off ... and ...

***Question***: Does that relate to your talk?

***Katagiri***: Oh, of course, it's related, of course.

***Question***: Well, maybe sometimes.

[laughter]

***Katagiri***: That's good call for you. Think of it. That's ... difficult homework assignment. Because really, you can think of your whole life. 

Well actually, briefly speaking, if you want to reach the other shore, let's take one step, huh? Shikantaza. Okay? ... It's a very simple practice. Let's take one step. [car noise] But we do this mostly. On the other shore, go, and gassho are included, simultaneously. This is one step. That is shikantaza.

> (Below this point, I have not yet finished transcribing the talk. Beware.)

So, there are many ways to take one step. Everyone is different, take a different way of one step. Everyone takes even one step in a different way. So, somebody takes one step... somebody enjoy very much; somebody always suffers; and somebody with sadness and pensive; lots of types of one step. So, how to take one step in best way? That is ... I don't know. But I know, we can do, one step.

(1:29:50) Can you see the difference? Anyway, just one step, okay? Or, if you aim at this short, long system, long life, .... From this shore to the other shore ... And then if you focus on just goal, then that main purpose of life is to meet this goal. The lifestyle becomes different. Don't you think so? Do you understand? Because, different. Because you want this goal. For this, in order to reach this goal, you have to struggle for life. Creating many things, try to do many things, successes, failures; many things. And then reach the goal, immediately you have to start do something again, in order to new goal. Always there is a goal, struggle. While you have struggling for, it's distraction. This is very common; dualistic world. 

So in the moment ... we can have a better life. Better life ... .... that is not a goal, already. It's still suffering. We suffer from the goal. Maybe we have reached. So still suffering, struggle. That is really distraction. 

***Question***: Are you saying that when you take one step it isn't a struggle? 

***Katagiri***: Yes, this is. 

***same person***: There is no struggle?

***Katagiri***: No struggle. Perfectly no struggle. No suffering, no delusions. Perfect. 

***same person***: So if this goal becomes a particular step?

***Katagiri***: Just one step. 

***same person***: [unintelligible]

***Katagiri***: ... always ... Not goal you are looking at. That goal is immense, large.

***same person***: How do I look at myself then? 

***Katagiri***: Well, through taking one step, you can see that.

[tape change]

(1:32:44) ... This life. But life makes life. 

How do you know? Well, we have to aim at life... and next ... life. Because ... 

So, just arrange all circumstances. Then stand up. Bloom. And if you bloom. Everyone realizes. Okay?

Because if you bloom, according to Buddhism, one is many, and many is one. You are connected with many. So if one tiny seed ... blooms, immediately, whole world is connected. ... Directly or indirectly. It's very helpful for you. So Dogen used the term, "flower blooms, the world arises." Spring comes, flower blooms. Which comes first? We don't know. ... and then, how can ... look at the ... blooming.

(1:35:00) That buddha dharma is very active life. ... In other words, exist. And also ... seasons exist. Your bloom. First of all, we have to bloom. If you bloom, you are not one, you are many.

So, take one step. If you take one step, one step, many steps. Immediately. That's why if you take one step perfectly, one step connects to second step very naturally, and also, steps. You can do. And next, it continues. It is perfect. 

***Question***: [unintelligible]

***Katagiri***: Well, arhats, bodhisattvas, and tathagathas, are all discrimination, aren't they... no, well, the categories, buddhist categories. So temporarily we categorize, the Buddhist capability ... is categorized. After ten days ???? There is arhat, and bodhisattva, and ...  Arhat means a person who deserves to see respect from others. To deserve, to command, respect. That is arhat. Because he becomes arhat by reaching the ... intimate nirvana. Respect, perfect. 

***Question***: What happens death comes? If an arhat is just waiting for death, what happens when death comes?

***Katagiri***: Well, he can('t) discriminate between death and his life. Anyway, just take breath. That's the same as his life. 

Just wait for death. But that death is not something particular apart from life. ... Just ... That's the same as life. 

You know that death consists of many moments. Life is same. Life is also consisting of many moments, according to time process. What's different between death and life? We can try to put a certain name on a certain moment, which is called death, or which is called life. That is our name. But basically, all the same moment. Moments just going on. Moment, moment, moment.

But we cannot completely depend on moment without any name. Because moment comes and goes fast. That's why we cannot stand up there. So we need cultural background, and we need ... and what's happened from the beginning of the world ... And then, this is systematized. We feel relief, because that is something we can depend on. But in time process, time is not something we can depend on. Completely going away. So life is something we have to completely depend on - yes or no? Life is completely going on. It's pretty hard. ...

from England, to get married. This young man, situation I performed ... and then they left for home, two weeks ... Can you imagine? That was first ... service for ... in the United States. Her name is White Rose. 

So, life, of course, life is something you can depend; but it's temporary. Completely we cannot depend on. But we cannot.... So temporarily, we have to take care of life. With best ... With best means to employ, we have to deal with life. No way, no excuse to escape. 

From this point, death is safe. Death is something we should depend on, or we should expect something after death? Right in the middle of death. No one knows. But finally something left, which is called ???? Right in the middle of death, what should we do? Should we think about death? Or should we ... death? Nothing to do. Because it's nothing but time. Life is same: nothing but time.

So for arhat, if you understand this original nature of life and death in that way, you can wait for death. ... same as life, you can give. 

(1:43:56) And then, as long as we have consciousness, consciousness always show you certainly flickering lights. Like or dislike, always. Because, we analyze death. ... So we always analyze. We fear death.

But that ... we can see objectively is nothing but flickering lights. Appear, disappear, object. And then arhat can accept death. Flickering lights; "Oh, flickering lights." So that's why people ask you, "How do you feel about death?" Maybe he'd say, "I don't want to die." I don't want to die doesn't mean "I don't really like death." That death is a ... flickering lights. That's why he said.. ... I want to live more. But this word is very different from Katagiri said, "I want to live more." That is very deluded. Death; clinging to life. Well, for the arhat, same. But, there is humor, kind of humor. "I don't want to die"; but, he knows peace, right before death. But he knows, on the other hand, flickering lights. "Hey Katagiri - all these flickering lights push you, poke you. Tap you."

(1:45:00) Tap your back. [tapping sound] Do you like death? "No." Do you want to live more? "Yes, I want to live." ... But death ... take care of you. I will take care of you, Katagiri. Even if you don't like, death is good for you. Death will take care of you. So finally I say, "Okay, okay; that's up to you." [laughs] Completely give up. Because I, and death, and life, are all the same. ... So, maybe for arhat, his life is very peaceful. His death is very peaceful. But Zen master says, would you give me a certain message for disciples, because you are dying please? We need final words. He said, "I don't want to die." This is final words for him. That means, watch out, you should know flickering lights, right in the middle of death; tapping your back, always. But even your back, it is...  So, all you have to do is, ... without always tapping your back... That's pretty...  There is kind of humor, but, it is really true.

So, there is no time to ... Whether I can die, or ... pain and confusion. I don't know what will happen right before I die. Maybe I scream, "Help!" [laughs] "Maybe I scream ..." [laughter] But no guarantee. No guarantee. But I know that. That's why I cannot ignore my life, my death. But I have to, anyway, move, take one step, forward, one by one. That's all I have to do. But even though I take one step, there is no guarantee before and after. That's all I have to do. 

(1:48:30) We cannot ... freedom. So whatever you say, "Oh, help, Katagiri, help" ... or "I can keep quiet and die. Bye-bye, for a while." This is also my ... in the realm of no guarantee. But sometimes it's ... "Don't say bye-bye. Why don't you go with me, just for a while." "Oh, come on. Just go by yourself." [group laughter] Maybe this happens. That is a flickering light.

Well you know, sometimes I take a ... back seat of an airplane, take a trip. And my son says, "Dad, you should have insurance." And I said, "No. I don't want the insurance. Because, how can I ... money?" [laughter] I don't like it. If I'm going to die, I want to take insurance with me. [laughter] Well, I pay the money for insurance, actually ... I really appreciate it. ... $20,000 So should I appreciate ... Such delusions come up, always. This is really flickering.
