**Katagiri Roshi:** In the *Book of Equanimity*, there is an interesting question and answer between Zen teacher and his student. Case 52: 

> Sozan Zen Master – Caoshan in Chinese – asked Elder De, “‘The buddha’s true reality body is like space: it manifests form in response to beings, like the moon in the water.’ How do you explain the principle of response?”
> 
> De said, “Like an ass looking in a well.”
> 
> Caoshan said, “You said a lot indeed, but you only said eighty percent.”
> 
> De said, “What about you, teacher?”
>
> Caoshan said, “Like the well looking at the ass.”
> 
> (This appears to be from an early version of *Book of Serenity* translated by Thomas Cleary. “Ass” means “donkey”.)

> Caoshan asked Elder Monk De, “‘The buddha’s true reality body 

That may be understood as the ultimate state of mind-heart. The very ultimate state of mind and heart is manifesting in the simplest way, very simple. That is called, we say, oneness. Very simple, but in the extrenal world, including the material world, and also the state of consciousness you can see, they are very complicated. But real ultimate state of mind-heart is very simple. So that is here called “the buddha’s true reality dharma.” Originially it says “true dharma body”, it means the real state of the truth, what is real truth. 

So here it says “the buddha’s true reality body is like space”. Space here is represented as akasha in Sanskrit. Akasha means space or sky. So this is a particular term in Buddhism. In the Prajñāpāramitā Zen scriptures, this term can be found very often. *Akasha* is used for representing space and sky, which means *boundlessness*, infinity. Or countless. That is space. So in Abhidharmakosha – Abhidharmakosha is oldest Buddhist scripture, explaining the human world, human life in terms of the faculties of consciousness – it says akasha has a specific quality of “no obstruction,” in which it has its motion. So akasha – space or sky – is characterized by no obstruction, no hindrance, because it’s boundless, its infinite, it’s countless. And then in this boundlessness, in this infinity, forms means form of the human body, form of a flower, form of a table, can have a chance to move, to function. Is that clear? So only within the akasha – space and sky – which means boundless infinity – form of all sentient beings can make their life alive. Alright? So where are you now? Are you in your own territory, you believe? Mm-mm. (No.) That is a small scale, small understanding, very shallow understanding. So you are alive now – where are you? Why can you be alive? Because you are in akasha. This is a unique chance, opportunity, for all sentient beings to make their lives alive, or to make their lives manifest themselves, anyway, in everyday life. So that’s why it says akasha has a specific quality of no obstruction, no hindrance. This infinity, boundlessness, is characterized by no hindrance. That means constantly working and funcitoning, supporting, helping all sentient beings to create their own life. It makes sense, really. That is in which it has its motions. You can see real motion of human life, real aliveness of human life, in where? Not in your territory. If you see your function, motion, in your territory, it freezes immediately. It doesn’t work. Only in the realm of infinity, boundlessness, you can see real function, total working of your life, full aliveness of your life. 

Let’s read the first sentence:
