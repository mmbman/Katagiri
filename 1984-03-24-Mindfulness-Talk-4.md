**Katagiri Roshi:** ... First let me read the next paragraph:

> Studying in such a manner, in the time of demons-becoming-buddhas we subdue demons and make buddhas with demons. In the time of buddhas-becoming-buddhas we are mindful of buddhas and make buddhas with buddhas. In the time of people-becoming-buddhas, we bring harmony to people and make buddhas with people. We should study the truth that there is the approach to buddhas where we are taking advantage of.

> Studying in such a manner, ...

First of all Dogen Zenji says “studying in such a manner.” That is a point we studied yesterday, but briefly speaking: 

A body is that which is completely beyond a sense of purity or impurity. That is a body; that is *your* body. And through the practice of mindfulness you should observe or contemplate the body of *this* kind, not the body as a sense of purity or a sense of impurity. We should at any cost observe or contemplate the body *beyond* the sense of purity or impurity. This is the practice of mindfulness. 

That’s why this mindfulness says “observing the body as not-pure” – because the whole body is completely filled with supreme purity. Nothing to compare. At that time, it is not necessary to emphasize particularly or strongly the presence of purity. So purity drops off. 

For instance, when you are perfectly healthy, I don’t think you should emphasize [that you are] healthy. All organs, your body, your mind, working smoothly – at that time, no perception of health. So perfect health – *beyond* health or not-health – is expressed by the term *not-health*. Because it’s not necessary to say in particular, “I am healthy.” That is called *your body, your mind is completely filled with health*; no space to bring any other ideas into it. That is called *buddha*; we say buddha. Buddha is completely beyond purity or impurity. That is called *truth*, which is *omnipresent*, we say. Buddha is omnipresent. 

So when your health is omnipresent throughout your body [and] throughout your mind, [your] idea [or] perception of health drops off. How can you express it? No health, [or] not-health. 

So that’s why here it says, “Observing the body as not-pure.” That means the body is supreme purity, so-called buddha. We have to observe [or] contemplate the body of *this* kind. 

So *body* doesn’t mean your own body. If your body is buddha, beyond purity or impurity, *body-being* – [which] means right now, right here, be in the presence of your body – is nothing but manifestation of the Buddha. We use a big term, *samyaksaṃbodhi* or *bodhi*, that is buddha and buddha. 

And also that body works every day, in each area of a day. [In the] morning, when you wash your face, this is also body manifesting its own function, so-called washing your face. So washing your face is what? Not washing your face; washing your face is manifestation of buddha, beyond idea of purity or impurity. That practice of washing your face is called Buddha’s practice; we say Buddha’s practice, or practice buddha. [Buddha’s] practice or practice of buddha, we say so. So washing your face is not usual action, human action, it is Buddha’s action, Buddha’s activity. So washing your face, putting your clothes on, and coming to the zendo, and having breakfast, zazen – all things – are nothing but body manifesting as not-pure. So every day, you can really manifest Buddha’s life. 

That is, here it says, “studying in such a manner.” We have to study, we have to practice, we have to contemplate, we have to observe the body of this kind in our everyday life, whatever happens. 

But in the usual life in this human society, we don’t take advantage of human activity like this. We don’t do it. When you wash your face, just wash your face; that’s it. No meaning. 

Apparently, you washing your face or the other person washing their face, almost everyone does the same thing. But the quality is completely different. And also you can manifest your life in a completely different way from others. It’s not a matter of discussion, you know? Because creating the world, creating life is always going on right now, right here. Every day you have to do it. How to wash your face? Wash your face just like a bird bathing in the lake? [That is] also washing your face; it’s not different from [the washing of the face] by buddhas and by Dogen, you know? Dogen’s washing of face, Buddha’s patriarchs did it in the same way as we do. Or a bird bathing in the lake – same thing. But quite different. 

Anyway, that’s why Dogen Zenji says, “Studying in such a manner.” We have to study, observe, contemplate, and research our life in this way. That is called deepening your life. Not seeing your life in the flat dimension. Seeing your life in the flat dimension, that life is very realistic, reasonable – but very thin. Not so deep. 

#### 13:24

So Dogen Zenji says, “Studying in such a manner...”

> ... in the time of demons-becoming-buddha we subdue demons and make buddha with demons.

Well, this is a big question for you. Because demons are *demons-becoming-buddha*, that one word, means demons are not demons, demons are buddha. Completely beyond the sense of purity or impurity. Anyway demons, buddha. That’s why Dogen Zenji uses one word. *Demons-becoming-buddha* means demon is exactly buddha, buddha is demon. Exactly one; no gap, no space between. So that’s why it’s one word. 

“In the time” means everything: tape recorder becoming buddha. Tape recorder is buddha, floor is buddha, your nail is also buddha, your hair is buddha. So that is the presence of your hair is *hair-being*. Hair-being is great opportunity of manifestation of buddha. 

So that’s why “in the time of demons-becoming-buddha,” at that time what kind of world appears? He says, “we subdue demons and make buddha with demons.” So when you are in demons’ world, you have to be there with the demons, taking the form of demons, and then you should subdue them and become buddhas, make buddhas. 

You say immediately, “Demons are something wrong, *bad*.” The moment when you see the demons, you handle the whole world not as a buddha. You handle demons, tape recorders, whatever – yesterday I [said] – in terms of sense of value. That’s why it’s good or bad, cold, warm, et cetera. But we don’t practice [...] let them put the microphone, tape recorder, demons, trees or birds in equality, before you judge, evaluate. Put them all in peace. And then, as best as you can, we should deal with them. 

But more or less, the judgement, evaluation operates. That’s why as best as we can, we try to deal with tape recorder, microphone, you, clothes, tissues, toilet paper, whatever it is. Before you judge, evaluate, let’s [...] deal with all sentient beings as buddha. But usually we don’t; we immediately handle with a sense of value or evaluation, judgement. Then next moment, something happens: that is affective preferences. That makes you busy. So finally you completely forget the most important practice: so-called “let’s contemplate all sentient beings as buddha.” We completely forget, because [the] appearance [is] very busy. Because emotions come up, and like or dislike, and fighting, screaming, and hatred; many things come up. And also by the hatred, by the emotions, you really create a “ghost,” practically, every day. That’s why we completely *forget it*. Not on purpose, you know. The circumstances make you forget, because [they’re] busy. 

So that’s why Shakyamuni Buddha, [ancestors], constantly we have to say, “We are buddha.” But good or bad, right or wrong, and purity or impurity are nothing but the virtuous quality. The tape recorders, demons, themselves don’t have any particular label, so-called “bad” or “good,” or “purity” or “impurity.” Originally [they’re] not; they don’t have any ideas. 

For instance, your blood. Your blood circulates [through] your body. When the blood is with you, and then blood becomes warm. If it is separate from you, blood becomes cold. What does it mean? Can you say “blood is warm”? No. Blood itself doesn’t have any sense, any ideas. [It is] a being completely beyond warm and cold, good or bad. It’s pure, [supremely] pure. That is called buddha. And then, when the blood is with you, circulating [in] your whole body, [then] blood shows its own virtuous quality, so-called warm. Next moment, blood separates from your body, and then blood shows its own virtuous quality, so-called cold. That’s it. And also when the blood is blood stains on your clothes or somebody’s clothes, and then says, “dirty.” So blood shows its own virtuous quality, so-called dirty. 

You know rice... food. Food is beautiful because you eat [it]. Very pure, clean food. But food itself doesn’t have any ideas. When you have food [in] your bowl, and then handle [it] in the appropriate way, food always shows its own virtuous quality, so-called clean. Next moment, you make a mistake, and your bowl [falls] and the food scatters on your floor. At that time, people come in, and how do you see it? It’s dirty. You don’t want to eat it. So when the food separates from the bowl in the appropriate manner, then it scatters on the floor. At that time, food shows its own virtuous quality, so-called dirty food. So food itself is really buddha. Nothing. 

You know you eat the food, and sometimes you should [think about] the inside of your stomach. *[He laughs.]* It’s really dirty, because all food comes together and is digested, you know? But if you see it through the six consciousnesses, you say it’s dirty, but it’s not dirty, because it supports your life. So food itself, digestion itself, doesn’t have any sense, dirty or good or bad, right or wrong, purity or impurity. Completely digestion is digestion. We have to observe, contemplate food as not-pure, as a buddha. This is our practice. 

[Or for example, if] you smoke a cigarette. I used to smoke [cigarettes]. The cigarette itself, smoke itself, doesn’t have any sense, any ideas. So I think [...] by the cigarette there are some individuals who attain enlightenment. *[He laughs.]* There are some individuals who are really confused with cigarettes. There are some individuals who really fight with the cigarette, because it’s related very closely with his or her business, so always fighting. But there are some individuals who really attain enlightenment, and quit smoking cigarettes, keeping his or her body healthy. So where is *[unintelligible]*? The cigarette itself is really buddha, anyway. When the cigarette belongs to a certain particular person, that cigarette shows its own virtuous quality, so-called *bad*. On the other hand, an old man who died, I forgot his name, who lived in Chicago for many, many years – 96 years old, but he smoked! He loved smoking and he loved drinking so much, but he lived to 96 or 97 years old. *[He laughs.]* So for him, what is a cigarette? The cigarette is nothing to damage his body. Pretty good; enjoying his life, he enjoyed very much his smoking. So smoking itself doesn’t have any particular ideas. That’s why it is buddha. 

If you see the demons [...] you have to deal with the demons just like this, alright? That’s pretty hard, because if you deal with the demons, very naturally you deal with the demons *for what*? You know, immediately you say, “For what?” “Katagiri says demons are buddha, so I want to deal with the demons, they’re buddhas.” How can you deal with the demons as buddha *practically*? Let me know. *[He chuckles.]* It’s very complicated. You cannot deal with demons as buddha in terms of what Shakyamuni Buddha or Dogen [talks about]. Practice is not so simple. People misunderstand demons, buddhas. If you say “the bar is buddha” or “gambling is Buddha,” whatever it is – wherever you may be, all are buddhas. So if you understand very simply, you can go anyplace, you know? You can enjoy your life. *But*... practically, *[he chuckles,]* your life becomes messy. 

[So] you handle the demons when you see the demons, but you always cope with the demons for the sake of your desire. In many ways. For the sake of *something*. Enjoying, or satisfying your desire, in a big scale or in a small scale, in just a little bit... sometimes you don’t notice. But psychologically, that desire is always working. You deal with the demons, but demons are pretty good for you: at that time you can say demons are buddha, you know? For instance, “cigarettes are buddha.” And then if you smoke a cigarette, cigarette is pretty good for you, you feel good. You enjoy smoking; at that time cigarette is not demon. You say, “Demons become buddha.” That is alright, but at that time, check you mind once again. Study and observe your mind. Is there any sense, even slightly, [...] of satisfying your desire. Satisfying your desire means good or bad, in many ways. In a good way, in a bad way, in a neutral way, you always satisfying your desires. That’s very common. But people don’t pay attention to it. [They] just simply handle the demons according to the “teaching.” “The teaching says demons are buddha, so let’s use [that].” But I don’t think it’s so simple. 

That’s why Dogen Zenji says, “In the time of demons becoming buddhas, *you subdue demons*.” You cannot handle the demons recklessly. No. You cannot handle demons according to your desires, your sense. Because [...] “demons are buddha” means demons are completely perfect beings beyond the idea of purity or impurity, so you have to deal with the demons just like this. How? You must be very simple. Your activity must be very simple, just like a stream of water: just pass by from moment to moment. Don’t stay with it. That’s pretty hard practice. 

Somebody hits you from [behind] without any reason: at that, time can you handle this as a buddha? Maybe... maybe not. But no guarantees. But the question is, at the moment when somebody hits you without any reason, at that time you have to practically deal with that person as a buddha... and the situation, and you. That’s pretty hard. 

Yokoi Roshi, a friend of mine, I was very impressed by his life, because no matter what situation he might be [in], he always kept going in the same calm pace. He never changed. I was *very* impressed. We are pretty easy to stumble, confuse, in certain situations, particularly in unfavorable conditions. 

So you have to handle that person who hits you with no reason: at that time you do gassho and bow, without expecting any reward. But of course, no one says you are great. And then you just do. But still psychologically, your mind is working. Just do gassho, [and] right after this, maybe your mind thinks, “Probably this gassho will deepen my life.” *[People laugh.]* Don’t you think so? I always do it. *[He laughs.]*

Hashimoto Roshi always scolded us, picking [on] gassho and bows, from moment to moment. There is no chance to escape, so everyone does really perfect gassho, wonderful gassho. I expected always... Intellectually I don’t understand why I have to do this, *[he laughs,]* because just this one. I didn’t see any benefit from this practice. If I do this, how much can I get a benefit? *[He laughs.]* Nothing. But he says, “It’s to become Buddha,” so I expect it, in many ways, psychologically, thinking, “This is buddha.” *[He laughs.]* 

So immediately that thinking or that expectation is that which you do something for the sake of something. For the sake of satisfying your desire. At that time, it’s very difficult to deal with the demons as buddha. But more or less, we handle like this. Demons, good or bad, right or wrong or neutral, we do always. That’s why we have to practicing subduing. *Subduing* means you have to deal with yourself just like a stream of water. Just gassho, that’s enough. Don’t leave any trace of psychological function – inside, nothing. Just do gassho. Can you do this? That’s pretty hard. But all we have to do [is] just like this. That is really practice. 

That is called, in Japanese, [*ikon zadansu*]. [*Ikon*] means “mind.” [*kon*] means “root.” Root of the mind, root of thoughts. [*Zadam*] is “cut off.” The function of our mind is just like a [...] silver [...] very thin thread there, always. Just like a lotus root. Do you know the lotus root? If you cut the lotus root slightly, between, the very thin, silver, transparent thread there, and they take it out, and the thread comes up. Your consciousness is just like that. So it’s very difficult to just bow; exactly just bow [is] very hard. But we should do it. We should practice like this. 

So that’s why that practice is really [to] *subdue* or profound end. This is cutting off that thread. That is simple. From moment to moment, day by day we have to do it. Because we have a mind, this kind of mind. Very sticky mind there. So in our whole life, we have to do it just like this.

And then, “... and make buddha with demons.” So when you stumble in the realm of demons, you have to spring back in the realm of demons, not anything else. You have to stumble and you have to spring back again in *there*, not in [any] other. 

So, that is called buddha, we say buddha. “Demons are buddha.” If you have open eyes to see this buddha, that is the time demons become buddha. 

You know the bee hive. If you see a bee hive, more or less most of people feel fear, because bees sting you. But the bee hive itself is very quiet. If you leave it quietly, it is quiet. Because bee hive is buddha. 

The same applies to man and woman. Woman always emphasizes the right of the woman, you know, but man always emphasize man's pattern of thinking, woman always emphasize woman's pattern of thinking, and always fighting each other. In a sense this is alright, but we should know, who becomes buddha. Renting or borrowing the man's body or mind and then woman should attain enlightenment or buddha: no way, you cannot do it. Woman becomes buddha by woman, anyway. You cannot borrow the man's body and mind. That is why man and woman anyway practice hard, and we are already buddha, that is why we can do it. We can do it. But we don't see it. We always see the man, woman in terms of a sense of value, evaluation, in terms of certain *ism* or ideas. That is why it is very difficult to know how you become buddha, how you can live in peace and harmony. To live in peace and harmony means you should become buddha ...
