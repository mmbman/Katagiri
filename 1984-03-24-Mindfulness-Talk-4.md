First let me read the next part of...

> Studying in such a manner, in the time of demons-becoming-buddha we subdue demons and make buddha with demons. In the time of buddhas-becoming-buddhas we are mindful of buddhas and make buddhas with buddhas. In the time of people-becoming-buddhas, we bring harmony to people and make buddhas with people. We should study the truth that there is an approach to buddhas where we are taking advantage of. 

> Studying in such a manner, in the time of demons-becoming-buddha we subdue demons and make buddha with demons.

First of all Dogen Zenji mentions “studying in such a manner”. That is a point we studied yesterday, but briefly speaking, a body is that which is completely beyond a sense of purity or impurity. That is your body. And through the practice of mindfulness you should observe or contemplate the body of this kind, not the body as a sense of purity or a sense of impurity. We should at any cost observe or contemplate the body beyond the concepts of purity or impurity. This is the practice of mindfulness. That’s why this mindfulness says observing the body as not-pure, because the whole body is completely filled with supreme purity. Nothing to compare. At that time, not necessary to emphasize particularly or strongly the the presence of purity. So purity drops off. 

For instance, when you are perfectly healthy, I don’t think you should emphasize your health. All organs, your body, your mind, working smoothly, at that time no perception of health. So perfect health beyond health or not-health is expressed by the term not-health, because it’s not necessary to say in particular “I am healthy.” That is called your body, your mind is completely filled with health, no space to bring any other ideas into it. That is called Buddha, we say Buddha. Buddha is completely beyond purity or impurity. That is called truth, which is omnipresent, we say. Buddha is omnipresent. So when your health is omnipresent throughout your body, throughout your mind, your perception of health drops off. So how can you express it? No health, not-health. So that’s why here it says, “Observing the body as not-pure.” That means body is supreme purity, so-called Buddha. We have to observe, contemplate the body of this kind. 

So body doesn’t mean your own body. If your body is Buddha, beyond purity or impurity, body-being means right now, right here be in the presence of your body is nothing but manifestation of the buddha. Som...sambodhi we use a big term, sambodhi or bodhi, that is Buddha and Buddha. And also that body works every day in each area of a day. Morning when you wash your face, this is also body manifesting its own function, so-called washing the face. So washing the face is not washing your face, washing your face is manifestation of Buddha, beyond idea of purity or impurity. That practice of washing the face is called Buddha’s practice; we say Buddha’s practice, or practice Buddha. Buddha practice or practice of Buddha, we say so. So washing your face is not usual action, human action, it is Buddha’s action, Buddha’s activity. So washing your face, and putting your dress on, and coming to the zendo, and having breakfast, zazen, all things are nothing but body and mind manifesting as not-pure, so every day you can really manifest Buddha’s life. 

That is, here it says, “studying in such a manner.” We have to study, we have to practice, we have to contemplate, we have to observe that the body of this kind in our everyday life, whatever happens. But in the usual life, in human society, we don’t take advantage of human activity like this. We don’t do it. When you wash your face, just wash your face; that’s it. No meaning. 

But apparently you wash your face or the other person washing their face are almost everyone doing the same thing, but the quality is completely different. And also you can manifest your life in a completely different way from others. It’s not a matter of discussion, you know? Because creating the world, creating life is always going on right now, right here. Every day you have to do it. How to wash your face? Washing your face just like a bird bathing in the lake? It’s also washing your face; it’s not different from washing your face by Buddhas and by Dogens, you know? Dogen washing your face, Buddha’s patriarchs did it in the same way as we do. Or a bird, bathing the lake, same thing. But quite different. 

Anyway, that’s why Dogen Zenji says “studying in such a manner.” We have to study, observe, contemplate, and research our life in this way. That is called deepening your life. Not seeing your life in the flat dimension. Seeing your life in the flat dimension, that life is very realistic, reasonable, but very thin. Not so deep.

> in the time of demons-becoming-buddha we subdue demons and make buddha with demons

Well this is a big question for you, because demons-becoming-buddha, that one word, means demons are not demons, demons are Buddha. Completely beyond the send of purity or impurity. Anyway demons, Buddha. That’s why Dogen Zenji uses one word. Demons-becoming-buddha means demon is exactly buddha, buddha is demon. Exactly one; no gap, no space between. So that’s why it’s one word. “In the time” means everything: tape recorder becoming buddha, tape recorder is buddha, floor is buddha, your nail is also buddha, your hair is buddha, so that is the presence of your hair is hair-being. Hair-being is great opportunity of manifestation of buddha. So that’s why in the time of demons-becoming-buddha, at that time what kind of world appears? He says, “we subdue demons and make buddha with demons.” So when you are in demons’ world, you have to be there with the demons, taking the form of demons, and then you should subdue them and become buddhas, make buddhas. You say immediately, “Demons are something wrong, bad.” The moment when you see the demons, you handle the whole world not as a buddha, you handle demons, tape recorders, whatever. Yesterday I mentioned in terms of sense of body. That’s why it’s good or bad, cold, warm, et cetera. But we don’t practice ... let them put the microphone, tape recorder, demons, trees, birds, equality, before you judge, evaluate. Put them all in peace. And then, as best as you can, you should deal with them. But more or less, the judgement, evaluation opens. That’s why as best as we can, we try to deal with tape recorder, microphone, you, clothes, tissue paper, toilet paper, whatever it is. Before you judge, evaluate, let’s use, let’s deal with all sentient beings as Buddha. But usually we don’t immediately handle with sense of body or evaluation, judgement. Then next moment, something happens: that is affective preferences. That makes you busy. So finally you completely forget the most important practice: so-called let’s observe, let’s contemplate all sentient beings as Buddha. We completely forget, because appearance very busy. Because emotions comes up, and like or dislike, and fighting, and screaming, and hatred; many things come up. And also by the hatred, by the emotions, you really create a ghost, practically, every day. That’s why we completely forget it. Not on purpose, you know; the circumstances makes you forget, because busy. 

So that’s why Shakyamuni Buddha, patriarchs, constantly we have to say “we are Buddha.” But good or bad, right or wrong, and purity or impurity are nothing but the virtuous quality. The tape recorders, demons, themselves don’t have any particular label, so-called “bad” or “good,” or “purity” or “impurity”. Originally it’s not, they don’t have any ideas. 

For instance, your blood. Your blood circulates [through] your bodies. When the blood is with you, and then blood becomes warm. If it is separate from you, blood becomes cold. What does it mean? Can you say “blood is warm”? No. Blood itself doesn’t have any sense, any ideas. Completely beyond warm and cold, good or bad. It’s pure, supreme pure. That is called Buddha. And then, when the blood is with you, circulating your whole body, and its blood showed its own virtuous quality, so-called warm. Next moment, blood separate from your body, and then blood shows its own virtuous quality, so-called cold. That’s it. And also when the blood is blood stains on your clothes or somebody’s clothes, and then says, “dirty”. So blood shows its own virtuous quality, so-called dirty. 

You know rice, food. Food is beautiful because you eat. Very pure, clean food. But food itself doesn’t have any ideas. When you have food on your bowl, and then handle in appropriate way, food always shows its own virtuous quality, so-called clean. Next moment, you make a mistake, and your bowl stumbles over and the food scatters on your floor. At that time, people come in, and how do you see it? It’s dirty. You don’t eat. You don’t want it. So when the food separates from the bowl in the appropriate manner, then it scatters on the floor. At that time, food shows its own virtuous quality, so-called dirty food. So food themselves is really Buddha. Nothing. 

You know you eat the food, and sometimes you should look at the inside of your stomach. It’s raelly dirty, because all food comes together and is digested, you know? But if you see it through the six consciousness you say, it’s dirty, but it’s not dirty, because it supports your life. So food itself, digestion itself, doesn’t have any sense, dirty or good or bad, right or wrong, purity or impurity. Completely digestion is digestion. We have to observe, contemplate food as not-pure, as a Buddha. This is ... 

You smoke a cigarette. I used to smoke a cigarette. But cigarette itself, smoke itself, doesn’t have any sense, any ideas. 

So I think because by the cigarette there are some individuals who attain enlightenment. There are some individuals who really confused with cigarettes. There are some individuals who really fight with the cigarette, because it’s related very closely with his or her business, so always fighting. But there are some individuals who really attain enlightenment, and quit smoking cigarettes, keep his or her body healthy. So where is the ... The cigarette itself is really Buddha, anyway. When the cigarette belongs to a certain particular person, the cigarette shows its own virtuous quality, so-called bad. On the other hand, when old men who died, I forgot his name, who lived in Chicago for many, many years, 96 years old, but he smoked, he loved smoking, and drinking, he loved so much. But he lived to 96 or 97 years old. *[He laughs.]* So for him, what is a cigarette? The cigarette is nothing to damage his body.
