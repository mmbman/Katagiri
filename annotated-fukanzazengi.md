#### Annotations by Kikan Michael Howard

#### Updated August 4, 2025

Katagiri Roshi discussed *Fukanzazengi*, Zen Master Dōgen’s “Universal Recommendation for Zazen,” in many of his talks. On this page, I go through *Fukanzazengi* line-by-line and add notes and links to talks where Katagiri Roshi discussed the line or lines in question. 

For the translations, “(SZ)” indicates the [Sōtōshū translation of *Fukanzazengi* (external link)](https://www.sotozen.com/eng/zazen/advice/fukanzanzeng.html), which is used by many English-speaking Zen centers. “(KR)” indicates alternative translations by Katagiri Roshi, where they are available. 

English translations of *Fukanzazengi* vary widely, and no single translation should be taken as authoritative. For a comparison of six English translations of *Fukanzazengi*, see [“Fukanzazengi: 6 translations” (external link)](https://zendogen.es/textos-zen-pdf/Fukanzazengi-6-translations.pdf). If six isn’t enough, see the [twenty translations organized by Fábio Rodrigues](https://artecontemplativa.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Fukan-Zazengi-Eihei-Dogen-20-translations-Fabio-Rodrigues.pdf). Beyond that, compare [the translation at Confluence Zen Center](https://www.confluencezen.org/fukanzazengi/).

This document is a work in progress. I will update this page as I transcribe talks and find additional references.

### 普勸坐禪儀
### *Fukanzazengi*

> 原 夫道本圓通、  
>  
> (SZ): The Way is originally perfect and all-pervading. 
>
> (KR): The origin of the way is perfect and all-pervading.

- Katagiri Roshi translates this as, “The origin of the way is perfect and all-pervading.” See [“Fukanzazengi: Dōgen's Universal Recommendation for Zazen – Talk 1”](1979-06-09-Fukanzazengi-Talk-1) at [56:36](1979-06-09-Fukanzazengi-Talk-1#5636), and also the start of [“Fukanzazengi: Dōgen's Universal Recommendation for Zazen – Talk 2”](1979-06-10-Fukanzazengi-Talk-2) and at [34:20](1979-06-10-Fukanzazengi-Talk-2#3420).
- "The Way" is *tao* or *dao* (道), or in Japanese, *dō*. Dōgen Zenji’s name, *Dō*-*gen* (道元), means “Way Origin.”
- For an explanation of what “the Way” means in Buddhism, perhaps the best place to start is [“Principles of Practice, Talk 1: The Purpose of Practice”](1986-03-19-Principles-of-Practice-Talk-1), from the beginning, followed by the whole [“Principles of Practice”](principles-of-practice) series.

> 爭假修證。  
>  
> (SZ): How could it be contingent on practice and realization? 

- “Practice and realization” is a translation of *shushō* (修證). This important term appears several times in *Fukanzazengi*; here it is also translated as “practice-realization” and “practicing and realizing.” Elsewhere it is sometimes translated as “practice-enlightenment.”
- The meaning of *shō* (證), often translated as “realization,” should not be taken for granted. Katagiri Roshi gave an entire talk on the meaning of *shō*, and its distinction from *kaku* and *satori*, which are sometimes translated as “awakening” and “enlightenment”: see [“*Shōbōgenzō Bendōwa*: Dōgen's Questions & Answers – Talk 5”](1987-03-15-Bendowa-Talk-5). This is also discussed in [“*Diamond Sutra*, Talk 9: Emptiness”](1979-08-01-Diamond-Sutra-Emptiness), in  [“*Genjokoan*: Talk 2 (Consciousness)” at 1:08:08](1987-06-06-Shobogenzo-Genjokoan-Talk-2#10808), and probably in other talks yet to be transcribed.
- The oneness of practice and realization is often presented as a key point of Dōgen’s teaching, if not his key point, period. A well-known statement from *Bendōwa* is, “To think practice and realization are not one is a heretical view. In the buddha-dharma, practice and realization are identical.” Also, Katagiri Roshi states that “... this is not [just] Dōgen Zenji’s idea, this is the essential point of Buddha’s teaching.” About this, see [“*Shōbōgenzō Bendōwa*: Dōgen's Questions & Answers – Talk 4”](1987-03-14-Bendowa-Talk-4). 
- See also the commentary on these lines in *Each Moment Is the Universe*, Chapter 6, “The Root of the Buddha Way.” This chapter is derived from more than one talk, which may or may not be available in the archive.

> 宗乘自在、何費功夫。  
>  
> (SZ:) The true vehicle is self-sufficient. What need is there for special effort? 
> 
> (KR:) The dharma vehicle is free and unrestricted, why should we expend sustained effort?

- Katagiri Roshi translates this as: “The dharma vehicle is free and unrestricted, why should we expend sustained effort?” See [“*Blue Cliff Record* Case 2: The Ultimate Path Is Without Difficulty, Talk 1”](1980-01-19-Blue-Cliff-Record-Case-2-Talk-1), especially to clarify the meaning of *dharma vehicle*.

> 況乎全體逈出塵埃兮、孰信拂拭之手段。  
>  
> (SZ): Indeed, the whole body is free from dust. Who could believe in a means to brush it clean? 

- “Dust,” “brush it clean,” etc. is a reference to [*The Platform Sutra*](platform-sutra) and the well-known story of the “poetry contest,” which is considered a foundational story in Chinese Buddhism. In the story, the top student Shen Hsiu (Japanese: Jinshū) writes a verse comparing Buddhist practice to brushing dust from a mirror to keep it clean, and the student Hui Neng (Japanese: Daikan Enō), who becomes the Sixth Ancestor, composes a responding verse. For the story and its interpretation, see [“*Platform Sutra* – Talk 1”](1987-03-06-Platform-Sutra-Talk-1). 
- Although these lines might initially seem to be supporting the verse attributed to the Sixth Ancestor Hui Neng over the verse attributed to Shen Hsiu, note that the very next words in *Fukanzazengi* are, “And yet.” As Katagiri Roshi states in [“*Platform Sutra* – Talk 1”](1987-03-06-Platform-Sutra-Talk-1) and on many other occasions, these perspectives are two aspects of the same reality, and they work together. They are two sides of the same coin, and Dōgen’s “and yet” is basically him flipping the coin. 
- Partly because of the *Platform Sutra*, it is commonly understood that there was a “Northern School” and a “Southern School” in early Zen, and that the Northern School represented “gradual enlightenment,” while the new Southern School represented “sudden enlightenment,” and the Southern School is regarded as superior. However, this does not exactly seem to be Dōgen Zenji’s understanding, nor Katagiri Roshi’s. Note that in *Shi-zen Biku* Dōgen refers to the Platform Sutra as “a forged writing,” and in *Sokushin Zebutsu* (“This Mind Itself Is Buddha”) he approvingly quotes one National Teacher Dazheng, who criticizes “folk stories” added to *The Platform Sutra* that “erase” the true meaning of the Sixth Ancestor’s teaching. There doesn’t seem to be anything subtle or complicated going on here: basically, it has always been understood that the *Platform Sutra* contains revisions by more than one person, some of which are problematic. This is discussed in [“*Platform Sutra* – Talk 1”](1987-03-06-Platform-Sutra-Talk-1), in the beginning and at [54:25](1987-03-06-Platform-Sutra-Talk-1#5425). On more than one occasion, Katagiri Roshi says that we should strive to understand the true teaching of both Hui Neng and Shen Hsiu.
- For a Western historical analysis of the “poetry contest” story, see John R. McRae’s *The Northern School and the Formation of Early Ch’an Buddhism*. The introduction to McRae’s posthumously released *Zen Evangelist: Shenhui, Sudden Enlightenment, and the Southern School of Chan Buddhism* sums up the general point: “McRae's meticulous analysis of the Northern school materials reveals the distortions and biases of the received tradition. To pick a single example, McRae takes to task the standard narrative that Northern teachers advocated a gradual path—that they viewed Buddhist practice as constituting a step-by-step ascent toward awakening. Instead, McRae shows that Northern teachers taught something closer to ‘constant practice’ —an approach that anticipates later Sōtō Zen teachings in Japan. For the Northern school, Chan practice was not a means to achieving liberation so much as a moment-to-moment re-cognition and affirmation of what is already the case, that is, of one's abiding *bodhi*.” This is perhaps not far off, except it should be understood that the teaching of the unity of “sudden” and “gradual” did not disappear with the “Northern School” and re-appear with Dōgen – it was present all along. Study for example *Song of the Jewel Mirror Awareness*, or any number of koans in the *Blue Cliff Record* (a Rinzai text!). Indeed, this teaching probably goes back at least to the time of Bodhidharma (“Two Entrances”) – and if so, presumably it goes back even farther than that.
- See also Katagiri Roshi’s commentary in [“*Blue Cliff Record* Case 45: Chao Chou’s Seven-Pound Cloth Shirt, Talk 1”](1983-05-25-Blue-Cliff-Record-Case-45-Talk-1) at [30:00](1983-05-25-Blue-Cliff-Record-Case-45-Talk-1#3000) (and note the historical shift in the assignment of “sudden” and “gradual”): “Zen history says Sōtō Zen is ‘gradual enlightenment,’ Rinzai Zen is ‘sudden enlightenment.’ It’s ridiculous! *[He laughs.]* If you talk about this, it’s ridiculous. If you’re really crazy about this discussion, you don’t understand Zen Buddhism, you don’t understand Buddha’s teaching, you don’t understand human life. *[He chuckles.]* History is history. Don’t worry about it. If you see someone who is interested in history, let him do that. But don’t be involved in it too much.”
- For a deeper dive into the meaning of *mirror* in Zen, see Katagiri Roshi’s commentary in “*Shōbōgenzō Kokyo*: Form and Mirror” – not yet available, but coming soon-ish.

> 大都不離當處兮、豈用修行之脚頭者乎。  
>  
> (SZ): It is never apart from this very place; what is the use of traveling around to practice? 

> 然而毫釐有差天地懸隔、違順纔起 紛然失心。  
>  
> (SZ): And yet, if there is a hairsbreadth deviation, it is like the gap between heaven and earth. If the least like or dislike arises, the mind is lost in confusion. 

- In Katagiri Roshi’s talks, discussions of the idea of *separation* or *discrimination* – and its opposite, which would be *samadhi*, “one-pointedness,” or “total acceptance,” etc. –  are probably too numerous to cite. A random example would be [“*Blue Cliff Record* Case 50: Yun Men’s Every Atom Samadhi”](1984-01-04-Blue-Cliff-Record-Case-50) (the talk I happen to be transcribing at the time of writing), which lines up very well with this discussion.
- Similarly, “like or dislike” appears too many times to be enumerated here – probably in over ten percent of Katagiri Roshi’s talks.
- The specific term “hairsbreadth deviation” appears in the *Song of the Jewel Mirror Awareness*. The *Song of the Jewel Mirror Awareness* also alludes to the legacy of the *Platform Sutra* with its reference to “sudden and gradual.” Although not publicly available, KR’s commentary on this is complementary with what can be found in [“*Platform Sutra* – Talk 1”](1987-03-06-Platform-Sutra-Talk-1).
- “Between heaven and earth”: see “*Blue Cliff Record* Case 51: Hsueh Feng’s What Is It? – Talk 1” at 51:32 (in progress).

> 直饒誇會豐悟兮、獲瞥地之智通、得道明心兮、擧衝天之志氣、雖逍遙於入頭之邊量、幾虧闕於出身之活路。  
>  
> (SZ): Suppose you are confident in your understanding and rich in enlightenment, gaining the wisdom that knows at a glance, attaining the Way and clarifying the mind, arousing an aspiration to reach for the heavens. You are playing in the entranceway, but you are still short of the vital path of emancipation.
>
> (KR): Suppose one gains pride of understanding and influences one’s own enlightenment, glimpsing the wisdom that runs through all things, attaining the way and clarifying the mind, raising an aspiration to escalade the very sky. One is making the initial partial excursions about the frontiers, but is still somewhat deficient in the vital way of total emancipation.

- This is extensively discussed in [“*Shōbōgenzō Bendōwa*: Dōgen's Questions & Answers – Talk 5”](https://katagiritranscripts.net/1987-03-15-Bendowa-Talk-5).

> 矧彼祇園之爲生知兮、端坐六年之蹤跡可見。少林之傳心印兮、面壁九歳之聲名尚聞。古聖既然、今人盍辦。  
>  
> (SZ): Consider the Buddha: although he was wise at birth, the traces of his six years of upright sitting can yet be seen. As for Bodhidharma, although he had received the mind-seal, his nine years of facing a wall is celebrated still. If even the ancient sages were like this, how can we today dispense with wholehearted practice?

> 所以須休尋言逐語之解行、    
>  
> (SZ): Therefore, put aside the intellectual practice of investigating words and chasing phrases, ...

> 須學囘光返照之退歩。  
>  
> (SZ): ... and learn to take the backward step that turns the light and shines it inward. 

- “Turn the light and shine it inward” is *ekō henshō* (回光返照). This key phrase is translated and understood in slightly different ways. 
- One way Katagiri Roshi translates this line is, “To learn the backward step that turns your light inwardly to illuminate yourself.” Another translation is, “To learn that one withdraws one step and turns the light inward on oneself.” 
- According to Katagiri Roshi, “the backward step” means to “return to the very inception of the moment.” It implies “cutting off the root of discriminative thought.” It does not mean “to withdraw,” nor “to escape from.” See [“Principles of Practice, Talk 4: Faith”](1986-03-22-Principles-of-Practice-Talk-4) and [“Principles of Practice, Talk 5: Direct Transmission”](1986-03-23-Principles-of-Practice-Talk-5). 
- The meaning of this line is probably simple, yet it seems to be easy to misunderstand. For example, the Sōtōshū’s *Shōbōgenzō Volume 8: Introduction and Supplementary Notes* states that “turn the light around and shine it back (*ekō henshō*)” is “a common idiom used in reference to Buddhist practice as the investigation of one’s own mind, as opposed to the external world.” While perhaps not wrong, this kind of statement may be easy to misunderstand as saying something like “shutting out the world,” which is probably why Katagiri Roshi clarifies that the backward step is “not [to] withdraw” and also “not escaping from.” Another way to say it might be that it’s taking a step back from our grasping after things and a step toward life as it is. On the other hand, sometimes this is indeed described as “coming back to oneself.” For a good example, see “*Blue Cliff Record* Case 52: Chao Chou Lets Asses Cross, Lets Horses Cross – Talk 1” (in progress). The point seems to be that when we return to ourself, the whole world is present. 
- Note that “turning the light around to shine within” immediately leads to the next line: “Body and mind of themselves will drop away, and your original face will manifest.”
- “The backward step” is closely related to *prajna* (“wisdom”). See [“*Platform Sutra* – Talk 2”](1987-03-20-Platform-Sutra-Talk-2), where the backward step is discussed as the function of *prajna*.
- In [“Principles of Practice, Talk 5: Direct Transmission”](1986-03-23-Principles-of-Practice-Talk-5), the backward step is also considered as *reflection*, in relation to *ignorance*.
- In [“Karma: Karmic Retribution in Present Life”](1980-07-10-Karmic-Retribution-in-Present-Life) at [50:45](1980-07-10-Karmic-Retribution-in-Present-Life#5045), Katagiri Roshi discusses the backward step of *ekō henshō* (回光返照) in relationship to the word *ekō* (回向, from Sanskrit *pariṇāmanā*) which means “dedicating the merit.” He says that *ekō* is “turning the merit to all beings, instead of holding on to it by yourself,” and that *ekō henshō* is similar. This might seem to be almost the opposite of “investigation of one’s own mind as opposed to the external world.”
- There is a clear statement of this in [“*Fukanzazengi*: Dōgen's Universal Recommendation for Zazen – Talk 1”](1979-06-09-Fukanzazengi-Talk-1) at [56:36](1979-06-09-Fukanzazengi-Talk-1#5636): Katagiri Roshi says that *shikantaza*, or the zazen of *Fukanzazengi*, “... is really helpful. That is really a way of helping people: offering your merit, the merit of your practice, to all sentient beings.”

> 身心自然脱落、  
>  
> (SZ): Body and mind of themselves will drop away, ...

- “Body and mind of themselves will drop away” (身心自然脱落) is related *shinjin datsuraku* (身心脱落), or “casting off body and mind,” one of Dōgen’s most well-known and frequently used terms. The specific term *shinjin datsuraku* is discussed in  [“Zazen: Dropping Off Body and Mind”](1987-01-24-Zazen-Dropping-Off-Body-and-Mind) and in [“Zazen: Entry to the Buddha Dharma”](1987-03-07-Zazen-Entry-to-the-Buddha-Dharma). In particular, [“Zazen: Dropping Off Body and Mind”](1987-01-24-Zazen-Dropping-Off-Body-and-Mind) is an important talk where dropping off body and mind is discussed in relation to *compassion*.
- Note that the additional characters “自然” which are translated as “of themselves” are more often translated as “naturally.” As an aside, it might also be observed that Katagiri Roshi uses the words “very naturally” repeatedly in almost all of his talks. Whether there is a connection there must be left to the reader/listener to decide.
- “Body and mind of themselves will drop away” is extensively discussed in the [*Fukanzazengi*](fukanzazengi) series. Particularly see the beginning of [“*Fukanzazengi*: Dōgen's Universal Recommendation for Zazen – Talk 4”](1979-06-12-Fukanzazengi-Talk-4): “In shikantaza, all delusions drop off from the first. That is dropping off body and mind, body and mind dropping off. That is zazen itself.” And also: “Dōgen Zenji says, ‘Zazen is dropping off body and mind.’ Remember this. In your whole life, you should remember: ‘Zazen is dropping off body and mind.’ It means all delusions drop off.” 
- “Body and mind dropping off” is discussed from the standpoint of Buddhist psychology in [“Fukanzazengi: Dōgen's Universal Recommendation for Zazen – Talk 6”](1979-06-14-Fukanzazengi-Talk-6).
- Another clear reference is in [“Principles of Practice, Talk 4: Faith”](1986-03-22-Principles-of-Practice-Talk-4): “So that is, if you put your body *right there*, then you can drop off your body and mind, drop off, you can be free from the root of discriminating mind. That means you can be exactly one with the very minute vibration of the mind. And then, no concept of the minute vibration of the mind.”
- “Dropping off body and mind” is closely related to “from the first, dullness and distraction are struck aside.” This is mentioned in [“Zazen: Entry to the Buddha Dharma”](1987-03-07-Zazen-Entry-to-the-Buddha-Dharma). See also the notes for “dullness and distraction are struck aside” below, closer to the end.
- A good search term in KR’s talks is “drop off.” There are many references to things that “drop off”: delusions, dullness and distraction, verbal explanations, all unwholesome things, all unwholesome human behaviors, thought and discursive thinking, ideas, the “concept of wondrous practice which you have realized” ... and so on.

> 本來面目現前。  
>  
> (SZ): ... and your original face will manifest. 

- “Original face” is discussed in connection with *total personality* and *buddha-nature* at the beginning of [“*Fukanzazengi* – Talk 2”](1979-06-10-Fukanzazengi-Talk-2). See also [“*Fukanzazengi* – Talk 6”](1979-06-14-Fukanzazengi-Talk-6) after [1:16:36](1979-06-14-Fukanzazengi-Talk-6#11636), and [“Blue Cliff Record Case 25: The Hermit of Lotus Flower Peak Holds Up His Staff, Talk 2”](1981-11-22-Blue-Cliff-Record-Case-25-Talk-2) after [1:00:05](1981-11-22-Blue-Cliff-Record-Case-25-Talk-2#10005). 
- Just as “dropping off body and mind” is closely related to “from the first, dullness and distraction are struck aside,” “your original face will manifest” is closely tied to “the right dharma is manifesting itself.” This is implied in [“*Fukanzazengi*: Dōgen's Universal Recommendation for Zazen – Talk 1”](1979-06-09-Fukanzazengi-Talk-1); where it’s discussed as “the original nature of the self is manifesting” and “manifesting the original nature of existence.”

> 欲得恁麼事、 急務恁麼事。  
>  
> (SZ): If you want to realize such, get to work on such right now.

- A better translation might be, “If you want to realize *suchness*, practice suchness immediately.” To “get to work on” something generally implies that there is a goal.

> 夫參禪者、靜室宜焉、  
>  
> (SZ): For practicing Zen, a quiet room is suitable. 

- The words “practicing Zen” are a translation of *sanzen* (參禪, or 参禅 in simplified Chinese). Katagiri Roshi leaves the term *sanzen* untranslated, because the word *practice* in English “doesn’t hit the mark” of what *sanzen* means. He comments on the actual meaning of *sanzen* extensively. See:
   - [“Zazen: Dropping Off Body and Mind”](1987-01-24-Zazen-Dropping-Off-Body-and-Mind)
   - [“Zazen: Entry to the Buddha Dharma”](1987-03-07-Zazen-Entry-to-the-Buddha-Dharma)
   - [“Principles of Practice, Talk 1: The Purpose of Practice”](1986-03-19-Principles-of-Practice-Talk-1)
   - [“Principles of Practice, Talk 2: Bodhicitta”](1986-03-20-Principles-of-Practice-Talk-2)
- “A quiet room is suitable” is discussed as “arrangement of the sensory system” in [“*Fukanzazengi*: Dōgen's Universal Recommendation for Zazen – Talk 1”](1979-06-09-Fukanzazengi-Talk-1) at [36:23](1979-06-09-Fukanzazengi-Talk-1#3623), and in the rest of the series, along with additional details from *Shōbōgenzō Zazengi* (which is distinct from *Fukan Zazengi*).

> 飮飡節矣。  
>  
> (SZ): Eat and drink moderately. 

- “Eat and drink moderately” (and also “breathe gently through your nose”) is discussed as “arrangement of the internal organ system” or “gut system” in [“*Fukanzazengi*: Dōgen's Universal Recommendation for Zazen – Talk 1”](1979-06-09-Fukanzazengi-Talk-1) at [42:38](1979-06-09-Fukanzazengi-Talk-1#4238), and in the rest of the series.

> 放捨諸縁、休息萬事。  
>  
> (SZ): Put aside all involvements and suspend all affairs. 

- “Cast aside all involvements; cease all affairs” is discussed as “arrangement of circumstances” in [“*Fukanzazengi*: Dōgen's Universal Recommendation for Zazen – Talk 1” (34:20)](1979-06-09-Fukanzazengi-Talk-1#3420) and in the rest of the series.
- “Cease all affairs, all involvements” is discussed in [“*Blue Cliff Record* Case 40: Nan Ch’uan’s It’s Like a Dream, Talk 1”](1983-01-26-Blue-Cliff-Record-Case-40-Talk-1)
- “Throw away all affairs” is discussed in [“Arts and Buddhism”](1983-10-29-Arts-and-Buddhism)
- “Throw away all worldly affairs,” et cetera is discussed in [“*The Awakening of Faith* – Talk 38”](1986-05-02-Awakening-of-Faith-Talk-38)

> 不思善惡、莫管是非。停心意識之運轉、止念想觀之測量。莫圖作佛、豈拘坐臥乎。  
>  
> (SZ): Do not think "good" or "bad." Do not judge true or false. Give up the operations of mind, intellect, and consciousness; stop measuring with thoughts, ideas, and views. Have no designs on becoming a buddha. How could that be limited to sitting or lying down?

- This is discussed as the “arrangement of the brain and nervous system” in [“*Fukanzazengi*: Dōgen's Universal Recommendation for Zazen – Talk 1” (44:56)](1979-06-09-Fukanzazengi-Talk-1#4456) and in the rest of the series.
- Here Katagiri Roshi uses the Norman Waddell and Masao Abe translation: “Do not think good or bad; do not administer pros and cons.” “Cease all the movements of the conscious mind, the gauging of all thoughts and views. Have no design on becoming a Buddha.”

> 尋常坐處、厚敷坐物、上用蒲團。或結跏趺坐、或半跏趺坐。謂、結跏趺坐、先以右足安左腿上、左足安右腿上。半跏趺坐、但以左足壓右矣。寛繋衣帶、可令齊整。次右手安左足上、左掌安右掌上。兩大拇指、面相拄矣。乃正身端坐、不得左側右傾、前躬後仰。要令耳與肩對、鼻與臍對。舌掛上腭、唇齒相著。  
>  
> (SZ): At your sitting place, spread out a thick mat and put a cushion on it. Sit either in the full-lotus or half-lotus position. In the full-lotus position, first place your right foot on your left thigh, then your left foot on your right thigh. In the half-lotus, simply place your left foot on your right thigh. Tie your robes loosely and arrange them neatly. Then place your right hand on your left leg and your left hand on your right palm, thumb-tips lightly touching. Straighten your body and sit upright, leaning neither left nor right, neither forward nor backward. Align your ears with your shoulders and your nose with your navel. Rest the tip of your tongue against the front of the roof of your mouth, with teeth together and lips shut. 

- This is discussed as the arrangement of the “movement system” in [“*Fukanzazengi*: Dōgen's Universal Recommendation for Zazen – Talk 1” (39:42)](1979-06-09-Fukanzazengi-Talk-1#3942) and in the rest of the series.

> 目須常開。鼻息微 通。  
>  
> (SZ): Always keep your eyes open, and breathe softly through your nose.

- “Breathe gently through your nose” is discussed as “arrangement of the internal organ system”; see “eat and drink moderately,” above.

> 身相既調、欠氣一息、左右搖振。兀兀坐定、思量箇不思量底。  
>  
> (SZ): Once you have adjusted your posture, take a breath and exhale fully, rock your body right and left, and settle into steady, immovable sitting. 

- “Settle into steady, immovable sitting” might be translated as “sitting in zazen silently and immobile” (see [“*Fukanzazengi*: Dōgen's Universal Recommendation for Zazen – Talk 1” at 39:42](1979-06-09-Fukanzazengi-Talk-1#3942)). Here *immovable* or *immobile* has a meaning beyond simply staying still physically, because mind and body are closely connected. This is discussed in [“*Fukanzazengi*: Dōgen's Universal Recommendation for Zazen – Talk 2”](1979-06-10-Fukanzazengi-Talk-2): “*Immobile* means just sit physically, and also mentally, psychologically, you must be completely one with sitting.”

> 不思量底、如何思量、非思量、此乃坐禪之要術也。  
>  
> (SZ): Think of not thinking, "Not thinking --what kind of thinking is that?" Nonthinking. This is the essential art of zazen.

- “Don’t think anything” is “think not-thinking”: see [“*Diamond Sutra*, Talk 8: Provisional Being”](1979-07-25-Diamond-Sutra-Provisional-Being”).
- For *shujo shin* (“one-mind”) as *non-thinking*, see [“*The Awakening of Faith* – Talk 33”](1986-03-07-Awakening-of-Faith-Talk-33).

> 所謂、坐禪非習禪也、唯是安樂之法門也、 究盡菩提之修證也。

> (SZ): The zazen I speak of is not meditation practice. It is simply the dharma gate of joyful ease, the practice realization of totally culminated enlightenment. 

- The “dharma gate of repose and joy” or “dharma gate of repose and bliss” is discussed in [“Shōbōgenzō Bendōwa: Dōgen's Questions & Answers – Talk 3”](1987-03-13-Bendowa-Talk-3) at [55:17](1987-03-13-Bendowa-Talk-3#5517) and [1:11:57](1987-03-13-Bendowa-Talk-3#11157).

> 公案現成、籮籠未到。若得此意、如龍得水、似虎靠山。

> (SZ): It is the koan realized; traps and snares can never reach it. If you grasp the point, you are like a dragon gaining the water, like a tiger taking to the mountains. 

> 當知、正法自現前、昏散先撲落。  
>  
> (SZ): For you must know that the true dharma appears of itself, so that from the start dullness and distraction are struck aside.
>
> (KR): For you must know that just there, in zazen, the right dharma is manifesting itself, and that from the first, dullness and distraction are struck aside.

- This line is extensively discussed in [“*Fukanzazengi*: Dōgen's Universal Recommendation for Zazen – Talk 1”](1979-06-09-Fukanzazengi-Talk-1) as “a sort of conclusion of the main subject in *Fukanzazengi*,” and as “[the real] meaning of *shikantaza*.”
- “Dullness and distraction” are meant to exemplify all kinds of delusions. See [“*Fukanzazengi*: Dōgen's Universal Recommendation for Zazen – Talk 3”](https://katagiritranscripts.net/1979-06-11-Fukanzazengi-Talk-3).
- "Dullness and distraction" are extensively discussed in [“*Fukanzazengi*: Dōgen's Universal Recommendation for Zazen – Talk 3”](https://katagiritranscripts.net/1979-06-11-Fukanzazengi-Talk-3), and also [Talk 5](1979-06-13-Fukanzazengi-Talk-5) and [Talk 6](1979-06-14-Fukanzazengi-Talk-6).
- This is synonymous with “body and mind of themselves will drop away.” See above.

> 若從坐起、徐徐動身、安詳而起、不應卒暴。  
>  
> (SZ): When you arise from sitting, move slowly and quietly, calmly and deliberately. Do not rise suddenly or abruptly. 

- A practical example of moving calmly and deliberately appears in [“*Shōbōgenzō Bendōwa*: Dōgen's Questions & Answers – Talk 2”](1987-03-12-Bendowa-Talk-2) at [55:32](1987-03-12-Bendowa-Talk-2#5532)

> 嘗觀、 超凡越聖、坐脱立亡、一任此力矣。  
>  
> (SZ): In surveying the past, we find that transcendence of both mundane and sacred, and dying while either sitting or standing, have all depended entirely on the power of zazen.
>
> (KR:) In surveying the past, we find that transcendence of both un-enlightenment and enlightenment, and dying while either sitting or standing, have all depended entirely on the strength of zazen.

- This is extensively discussed in [“*Fukanzazengi*: Dōgen's Universal Recommendation for Zazen – Talk 4”](https://katagiritranscripts.net/1979-06-12-Fukanzazengi-Talk-4)

> (SZ): In addition, triggering awakening with a finger, a banner, a needle, or a mallet, and effecting realization with a whisk, a fist, a staff, or a shout --these cannot be understood by discriminative thinking; ...
> 
> (KR): In addition, the bringing about of enlightenment by the opportunity provided by a finger, a banner, a needle, or a mallet, and the effecting of realization with the aid of a hosu (that is, a whisk), a fist, a staff, or a shout cannot be fully understood by one’s discriminative thinking.

- This is discussed in [“*Fukanzazengi*: Dōgen's Universal Recommendation for Zazen – Talk 6”](1979-06-14-Fukanzazengi-Talk-6) at [21:38](1979-06-14-Fukanzazengi-Talk-6#2138).
- “The opportunity provided by” is omitted from the Sōtōshū translation, perhaps to streamline the sentence, but this is a questionable choice. The difference is whether the referenced devices bring about enlightenment directly, or they provide an opportunity.
- “Opportunity” is *ki* (機), which comes up again in “pivotal opportunity of human form”; see below.

> 豈爲神通修證之所能知也。可爲聲色之外威儀、那非知 見前軌則者歟。

> (SZ): ... much less can they be known through the practice of supernatural power. They must represent conduct beyond seeing and hearing. Are they not a standard prior to knowledge and views?
>
> (KR): It cannot be fully known by the practicing or realizing of supernatural power either. It must be deportment beyond one’s hearing and seeing. Is it not the principle that is prior to one’s knowledge and perceptions?

- This is discussed in [“*Fukanzazengi*: Dōgen's Universal Recommendation for Zazen – Talk 6”](1979-06-14-Fukanzazengi-Talk-6) after [39:44](1979-06-14-Fukanzazengi-Talk-6#3944).

> 然則不論上智下愚、莫簡利人鈍者。專一功夫、正是辦道。  
>  
> (SZ): This being the case, intelligence or lack of it is not an issue; make no distinction between the dull and the sharp-witted. If you concentrate your effort single-mindedly, that in itself is wholeheartedly engaging the way.

> 修證自不染汙、趣向更是平常者也。  
>  
> (SZ): Practice-realization is naturally undefiled. Going forward is, after all, an everyday affair.

- “Practice-realization” is again *shushō* (修證); see above. 
- For a good look at the meaning of the term *undefiled* in Buddhism, see “*Blue Cliff Record* Case 52: Chao Chou Lets Asses Cross, Lets Horses Cross – Talk 1” (in progress). 

> 凡夫自界他方、西天東地、等持佛印、一擅宗風。唯務打坐、被礙兀地。雖謂萬別千差、秪管參禪辦道。何抛卻自家之坐牀。謾去來他國之塵境。若錯一歩、當面蹉過。  
>  
> (SZ): In general, in our world and others, in both India and China, all equally hold the buddha-seal. While each lineage expresses its own style, they are all simply devoted to sitting, totally blocked in resolute stability. Although they say that there are ten thousand distinctions and a thousand variations, they just wholeheartedly engage the way in zazen. Why leave behind the seat in your own home to wander in vain through the dusty realms of other lands? If you make one misstep, you stumble past what is directly in front of you.

> 既得人身之機要、莫虚度光陰。  
>  
> (SZ): You have gained the pivotal opportunity of human form. Do not pass your days and nights in vain. 

- “Pivotal opportunity” is *kiyō* (機要), according to the Nishijima and Cross translation of *Shobogenzo*, Volume 1. For commentary on *ki* (機), see [“Dealing with Death, Dealing with Life”](1989-01-07-Dealing-with-Death-Dealing-with-Life) at [33:32](1989-01-07-Dealing-with-Death-Dealing-with-Life#3332).

> 保任佛道之要 機、誰浪樂石火。加以、形質如草露、運命似電光。倐忽便空、須臾即失。  
>  
> (SZ): You are taking care of the essential activity of the buddha-way. Who would take wasteful delight in the spark from a flintstone? Besides, form and substance are like the dew on the grass, the fortunes of life like a dart of lightning --emptied in an instant, vanished in a flash.

> 冀其參學高流、久習摸象勿怪眞龍。  
>  
> (SZ): Please, honored followers of Zen, long accustomed to groping for the elephant, do not doubt the true dragon. 

- For the (presumably related) story of the blind men touching the elephant, see [“Karma: Taking Care of Karma”](1980-07-04-Karma-Taking-Care-of-Karma) at [45:24](1980-07-04-Karma-Taking-Care-of-Karma#4524), tied to the discussion of *saṃjñā* or “perception.”
- “True dragon” refers to the story of Seiko (or Shoko, Chinese: Yeh Kung-tzu), who loved images of dragons. But when a real dragon decided to visit him, Seiko was alarmed, and either scared the dragon off or ran away, depending on who’s telling the story.

> 精進直指端的之道、尊貴絶學無爲之人。合沓佛佛之菩提、嫡嗣祖祖之三昧。久爲恁麼、須是恁麼、寶藏自開、受用如意。    
>  
> (SZ): Devote your energies to the way of direct pointing at the real. Revere the one who has gone beyond learning and is free from effort. Accord with the enlightenment of all the buddhas; succeed to the samadhi of all the ancestors. Continue to live in such a way, and you will be such a person. The treasure store will open of itself, and you may enjoy it freely.

- “If you follow this practice, your treasure chest will open of itself and you can use it at will” is discussed in Q&A in [“Shōbōgenzō Bendōwa: Dōgen's Questions & Answers – Talk 4”](1987-03-14-Bendowa-Talk-4) at [1:16:15](1987-03-14-Bendowa-Talk-4#11615).
