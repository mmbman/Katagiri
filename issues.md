This is an ongoing list of issues discovered in the online audio files. Some of these might be problems with the original recordings, but many might be fixable.

### Blue Cliff Record, Case 33: Ministry President Ch’en Sees Tzu Fu
### November 10, 1982

The audio in the archive for this talk is a duplicate of Case 32 from the previous week. 

### [Blue Cliff Record, Case 37: P’an Shan’s There Is Nothing in the World](1982-12-15-Blue-Cliff-Record-Case-37)
#### December 15, 1982 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi

The beginning and ending of this talk are missing, and what exists in the audio file appears to be a single tape side repeated three times. The same audio repeats at 39:00 and 1:18:31.

### [Blue Cliff Record, Case 38: Feng Hsueh’s Workings of the Iron Ox – Talk 2](1983-01-05-Blue-Cliff-Record-Case-38-Talk-2)
#### January 5, 1983 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi

This talk seems to include only the first side of the tape. Any discussion of the verse or notes is missing.
