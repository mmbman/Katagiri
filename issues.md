This is an ongoing list of issues discovered in the online audio files. Some of these might be problems with the original recordings, but many might be fixable.

### [Blue Cliff Record, Case 37: P’an Shan’s There Is Nothing in the World](1982-12-15-Blue-Cliff-Record-Case-37)
#### December 15, 1982 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi

The beginning and ending of this talk are missing, and what exists in the audio file appears to be a single tape side repeated three times. The same audio repeats at 39:00 and 1:18:31.
