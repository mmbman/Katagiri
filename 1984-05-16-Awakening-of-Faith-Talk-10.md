**Katagiri Roshi:**

[...]

Everyone has their book? 

So from that book, maybe you can get the spirit of Buddhistic faith. [...] 

Well, the other day, I explained a little bit about phenomena. Phenomena is the samsaric world. And the samsaric world is the world where we are related very closely with discriminating mind. That world is called *time*. The world is going by the time. The samsaric world is time. 

So in common sense, if you look at your life, where you are, it goes without saying that we are always in the present. Okay? So I say *nowness*. So we are *now*. 

So the other day I explained about nowness. Do you remember? What did I say? 

... 

#### 11:30

So you should understand this one through the practice, anyway. For instance, you, yesterday I mentioned, your activity must be on schedule, constantly. At that time, you believe your life is really tossed away by the schedule. So you believe you don't have subjectivity. But you must be subjective. Even though you are always on schedule, you must be yourself. You must be subjective, constantly. That point is not a matter of discussion. You have to do it, every day. You should learn what it is. I can tell you, I can explain it like this, but that is my experience. So you should taste it from your practice. 

So what is the nowness, which is called eternal? What is it? Why do you have to practice mindfulness? If you are always in the samsaric world, why do you have to do it? 

Okay, that's why the other day I mentioned, nowness is that which is always in the present. That present is not the present in relation with the past and the future, which is called samsaric world. Because you are practicing mindfulness. In other words, samadhi. You are constantly dwelling in samadhi there. At that time, it is eternal. It is eternal. 

So this eternal world, so-called nowness, comes from which is always, always eternal in the nowness. If you are always nowness in the nowness is, okay? Can you explain that nowness? Maybe so. But no matter how long I explain, that is nothing but the explanation of nowness. But that nowness is not, even though explanation of nowness, it doesn't hit the mark. So very naturally nowness is, you can explain the nowness , if you experience, but explanation of nowness is doesn't hit the mark. So very naturally, no matter how long you speak of nowness which is eternal, it's nothing. So it's really [sneaky]. 

So speechless speech. Real nowness is is speechless speech. That means, there is no nowness, no conception, no perception of nowness, but you can be always in nowness. So, in the words, no nowness. But practically, you are there. 

Ignorance, you don't know what the ignorance is. Later today I will explain. But it's very vast, [...]. But always there, in your life. The same applies to the nowness, eternal life. Eternal nowness is, you don't know what the eternal nowness is. But you are here. You can do it. 

So that's why it's speechless speech. Real nowness is with speechless speech. Always talking about nowness, real nowness, through your body and mind, if you practice it. If people can feel that, people can appreciate this, the practice you do. 

So, that is really nowness. And the Buddha himself, if you say Buddha, Buddha has that nowness constantly, ok? Nowness constantly. Which is silence, which is quiet. Because it's speechless, but it's there. Speechless speech. You know, the real nowness as the speechless speech is always stored in the Buddha's heart. And then this Buddha, physically, [is] connected with all sentient beings. When he connected with all sentient beings, he is not in the [consolatory], he is always in the nowness. Always in the nowness. If you are always in the nowness, your effort is not effort. Your energy is coming up naturally as it is. Just like a stream of water, gushing out of the stream, just like that. But in the samsaric world, unenlightened human beings always try to make an effort. So it makes you exhaust. But Buddha himself is  always standing in nowness. And then connected with all sentient beings. So physically, connected with all sentient beings, but he is always in nowness. Not in the samsaric world. But according to our eyes, we say, "Oh, Buddha is in our life, our world." Because Buddha always connected with all sentient beings. Helping. But attitude, spiritual attitude, spiritual security is just going naturally as they are. So, no problem. No samsaric world. But in terms of our eyes, we believe, "Oh, Buddha is just like us, living in the human world." And then we become familiar with the Buddha. And then we want to approach to this kind of Buddha. That is called Buddha's skillful method. Do you understand? To save all sentient beings. But Buddha himself is very straight, very straight. Whatever you say, whatever you express your being, oh, you are Buddha. You are just like a me, just like a human being. Thanks. Whatever you say, Buddha is always in the nowness. Otherwise, Buddha cannot help. 

For instance, if you are psychologist, if you are a teacher, to help somebody, if you are tossed away by, or if you really jump into the other’s suffering, then you cannot help. You have to jump into, connected with the person, but you must be always standing up in nowness. Do you understand that one? You must be you. But it's not always creating a gap. You connected, you jump into, but you are always quiet. And then you can help. 

But as a third eye, if you see that situation, oh, that he as a psychologist always jumping into the human suffering and helping. He has been jumping into the samsaric world in his suffering and helping. But I don't think so. He is always [...] in nowness. And then at that time, he can see overall picture, panoramic of human life, human suffering. Okay?

This is Buddha. That is called skillful mind, skillful method. Buddha shows that. 

You can show that. If you really want to help or educate somebody, you must be Buddha. Like this. 

But more or less, you can experience. This is Buddha. 

So that's why Buddha is not something extra or apart from you. You are Buddha. Anyway, you are all... The Buddha is always operative, anyway, constantly, in each of us, each one of us. Because you have to connect with all sentient beings and help. How can you help? 

So, that is Buddha's skillful method to save all sentient beings. 

And then, that's why in the Buddha statue, Buddha statue always Buddha, but the Buddha statue has always human shape. But a Buddha statue is something more than human shape. But if you don't make the Buddha following the human shape, you don't feel familiar with [it]. Because the Buddha becomes something different from human beings. That's why you don't feel, you don't want to approach. So that's why Buddha appears as a human being. But on the other hand, if you look at the Buddha statue, Buddha, there is something more than human shape. That's why that Buddha statue becomes object of worship. 

If you want to make a Buddha statue, with wood or metal, whatever, you have to, anyway, carve human shape, simultaneously you should put the spirit there. Not Buddha's spirit that some other people have; your spirit, as a Buddha. Simply put into. At that time, you can create human shape; simultaneously, there is something more than human shape. 

Well, even the gassho, this is you do. So very naturally, Katagiri’s gassho, but there is something more than Katagiri’s gassho. But that gassho, more than Katagiri’s gassho, cannot be explained. But it's there, if you do it. 

So whatever you do, that is always important. You must be Buddha, but you cannot always stay with the Buddha, without connecting with all sentient beings. You must be always Buddha, but you have to connect with all sentient beings. At that time, how you connect with all sentient beings? You constantly Buddha. 

So, today, that is nowness, okay? That's why the practice of mindfulness and also be present right now, right here, is important. It's not a kind of religious teaching, which is washing your brain, okay? Or which make your consciousness blind. If you practice like this, your mind becomes more clear. More clear. Finally, your consciousness starts to work. But if you people don't believe. If I always suggest to do that, that is kind of the army training. But I don't think so. 

So, this is nowness. In the common sense, you are always in two kind of nowness. And then, which would you like? Which would you like to choose? Nowness while being in the stream of time, or nowness you operate time. It really depends on you. Whatever you may be. And then, that practice, it creates quite different human life, which is blooming in the future. From moment to moment. 

But usually look at the human beings, human world. Always people are just struggling only in the realm of nowness in being in the stream of time. That's it. 

So, that is in the common sense, if you look at yourself, where you are, this is nowness. Always in nowness, but you have to know what the nowness is. That's why I explain a bit. 

And then today I want to say a little bit [more about] time, because nowness is time. So how does Buddhism look at time? 

In the *Abhidharmakosha*, it says that time doesn't have its own nature, its own substance. But time is produced by all beings. *All beings* means all things, so-called *dharmas*. With the 's', dharmas. Time is produced by the dharmas, that is all beings, all things. 

So, what the dharmas, all things means, do you understand *all things*? Time doesn't have its own nature. Doesn't have its own nature. Well, what is time? Do you understand this time? Time has a kind of a... if time doesn't have its own substance, can you explain what [is] the source of time? Is it possible for us to say the source of time, [anything] about the source of time? Yes? Can you? About that. Any other? Don’t think so? 

**Someone:** Can you say whatever exists is time? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Well no, I am talking about the statement of time according to *Abhidharmakosha*, saying time doesn't have its own substance. If so, can you explain about the *source* of time? Can you see the source of time? Or can you believe that there must be a kind of a source of time? 

**Someone:** If there isn’t any time, how can it have a beginning?

**Katagiri Roshi:** Mm-hmm. Pretty good.

**Someone:** I think that it is something that we sort of come up with in our minds to [...] in our minds. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Any other? 

**Someone:** It arises from beginningless [...]. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Mm-Hmm.

What does it? *[He laughs, and others laugh.]*

That means that it doesn't have its own substance. 

**Someone:** Right, *[unintelligible]*...

**Katagiri Roshi:** It doesn’t have a source. Don't you think so? 

**Someone:** What kind of time are you talking about, Roshi? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Well, according to the *Abhidharmakosha*. Time is not produced by a certain source of time. No, no, not source of time... time doesn't have its own substance. That's why time is produced by the change of all things. Alright? 

So that's why I say... Do you understand? Is that alright? If so, “time is produced by all things” means, for example, what do you mean? By all beings, all things. For example? 

**Someone:** *[Unintelligible.]*

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yes. How about this: time is produced by change of all things. What do I mean, for example? 

**Someone:** Well, everything that has substance has a beginning and an end [...] appears and disappears. So the duration of its manifestation would be time. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Mm-hmm. Well, what's change? What change? 

**Someone:** Well, anything that has... 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Subject or object? 

**Someone:** Object. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Object. All things. Okay? Do you understand? 

All things you can see... The change of all things, time is produced. That is what *Abhidharmakosha* says. Alright? 

If so, for example... This kind of thing is, according to Buddha's teaching, that is called "All things are impermanent." Like this. So your objects are impermanent. All right? 

Or... This is kind of... change of the objects you can see through the six senses, and also change of four seasons, change of nature, and also evolution of creatures. 

And then, by, for example, in other words... in other words, okay? By evolution of creatures, or the change of nature, change of four seasons, time is produced. Alright? If so, this time is kind of time in physics. [...] physics. According to Buddha, Buddha says, "All things are impermanent." Alright? 

So, let's, the other, the... [Vijnanabhava], which means the "Discourse on Mere Consciousness." Vijnanabhara. That is the "Discourse on Mere Consciousness." Which means that is the "Discourse on Mere Consciousness." M-E-R-E. Mere Consciousness. Or, this, the *Daijōkishinron*, "The Awakening of Mahayana Faith." According to this, the "Discourse on Mere Consciousness," and also this book, "The Awakening of Mahayana Faith," they understand that time is produced by the change of the consciousness. Alright? The change of the consciousness, the change of discriminating mind. That is most important in this book.

So, from this point, the change of the mind, by change of the mind, time is produced. This is very natural, okay? According to the 24 hours through your clock, watch, you can see the time, but clock is your object. But if you don't have a clock, you cannot know the time. But even though you don't have a clock, you can know, you can notice the time. How? How can you notice the time? Even though you don't have a watch, how can you notice? 

**Someone:** *[Unintelligible.]*

**Katagiri Roshi:** This is also pretty good idea of time in physics. Don’t you think so? Yes. ... if there was no time. Because if you are confined in a jail, which is dark, complete dark, nothing, how can you know time? 

**Someone:** It changes.

**Katagiri Roshi:** What changes? 

**Someone:** *[Unintelligible.]*

**Katagiri Roshi:** Sure, that's true. Sure. Change of your what? Your body. 

[...]

Yes. You feel hungry, even though you are in a dark room where you cannot see the sun, where you cannot see anything, you cannot think anything, but you still feel time, because when you feel hungry, it's time to have a meal, so-called lunch, dinner, et cetera. But that is physical body, just physical body is just a physical body, you know, just working. But who knows you are hungry? Who knows you are hungry? 

[...]

You do, yes. 

[...]

Mind. Yes, consciousness, discriminating mind, anyway knowledge, you are hungry. 

So, even though you are always in a dark room, still you can know the time, because change of mind. 

**Someone:** Is that a source of time?

**Katagiri Roshi:** No, no, not source. I am talking about how, what is time, what is time like? It has its own source, or substance, or it doesn't have a source? If it doesn't have a source, how is a time produced? Do you understand? So, that's why I am talking about this one. 

But if you faint – what's happening? What happens if you faint? Hmm? 

**Someone:** Time disappears. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Disappears. Right. Don't you think so? If you faint, time disappears. Your time disappears. What do [I] mean, time disappears? 

**Someone:** You have no recollection of time? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Mm-hmm.

**Someone:** Consciousness.

**Katagiri Roshi:** Consciousness, yes. When time disappears means your consciousness, stream of consciousness stops. Do you understand? Blocked, and then time goes. So, that's why time is produced change of the mind, consciousness. Alright? That's very true, don't you think so? 

So, this book is very interesting because the human beings can be seen, can be understood in terms of change of consciousness. That is the point this book always concentrates on. But, unfortunately, this book doesn't mention how the human mind works, how human mind work in the human society when you join the member of society. It doesn't mention. Just analyze, just understand human beings in terms of consciousness. So, it's wonderful understanding. But, not a concrete way of living. When you join to human society, it doesn't explain. So, just understanding human beings in terms of consciousness. That is very nice book. So, that's why time is produced by the change of consciousness. Alright? 

#### 43:37

And then look at the consciousness, our consciousness. So, consciousness is always going, moving, constantly, or whatever you feel. Under all circumstances, consciousness is always working. Operating. This is wonderful in a sense, because this is, that's the continuation, continuous, continuous, you know, the working of a human consciousness creates human culture, the discriminating mind, et cetera. But, on the other hand, very difficult. Because, under all circumstances, still you can create the human culture, you can go any place. But a human body doesn't develop under certain circumstances. If you become sick, it's very difficult to think wonderful world, because you cannot develop yourself, you know? So if human body becomes sick, so-called under circumstances, very difficult to develop human life. 

But on the other hand, conscious world is quite different from physical world. Alright? Even though you are sick, or even though under the unfavorable situation, or even though under very dangerous, very dangerous situation, still you can think, you can develop your life, develop human life. That's why we create constantly human culture. But on the other hand, it's wonderful, because it's giving the vitality to live...

*[Tape break.]*

... It makes you be up in the air always. Far from realistic way of life. But on the other hand, that consciousness always gives you vitality to live. That's wonderful. 

So, the characteristic of consciousness is constantly working. So, but it is good, but on the other hand, it is not good. That's why we have to make our mind calm, and understand human life. The calmness of your mind makes you stand up straight, right now, right here, constantly. That is nowness, you operate time. 

So, that's why we do zazen. But if you do zazen, do you think your mind can be completely calm? Can you believe? 

**Someone:** [...] Why couldn't it be? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Why? 

**Someone:** Why would not be possible? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** It's possible. 

**Someone:** Oh, I see.

**Katagiri Roshi:** It's possible. But I am talking about your experience. *[He laughs.]* Your consciousness. I am talking about your consciousness. Can you believe the mind becomes calm when you do zazen? 

**Someone:** *[Unintelligible.]*

**Katagiri Roshi:** Ah. *[He laughs.]* Any other? 

Well, consciousness is... yes, if you do zazen, your mind becomes calm. Okay? But right in the middle of calmness, still you don't believe, you cannot know what calmness is, because it's pretty tricky. You don't know what the calmness is. If you get the calmness, it's not calm. Don't you think so? You say, "I get a calmness!" At that time it's not calm, *[he laughs,]* because you stirred up calmness.

Can you see that kind of mind operating constantly like this? Do you understand? If you do zazen like this. So, the more you try to make your mind calm in zazen, the more you can see the operation of your mind. Alright? 

And in this book, we have to make your mind calm, but the more you make your mind calm, the more you can see the mind which you cannot make calm. In other words, your mind seems to be calm, but they are not calm actually, it means there are the minute, the functioning of the change of the consciousness there. Minute. Do you understand? Minute. Alright? 

Then, right in the middle of calmness, you immediately say, "I get the calmness!" Then that is really minute change, very minute, you know, change of consciousness. And then next moment, forget it. *[He laughs.]* Okay? Forget it. Forget it and then sit constantly. Still there is there. It means you have to continually say, "Forget it. Forget it. Forget it." Okay? So that minute, the most minute change of consciousness, still being, can be recognized in samadhi, in calmness of your zazen.

This is called *moment*. In this book, this is called *moment*. Because time is produced by change of the consciousness. So still there is, you are living constantly in the stream of time. Alright? So [...] it is very difficult to take initiative activities right in the middle of stream of time. Because still, always, there are, there are the most minute change of consciousness always there. But more or less, you can do it. So constantly, that's why you have to know how consciousness is changing. You have to realize through and through in zazen.

That's why the most minute change of consciousness recognized by your calmness, by your zazen, is called moment. That's why Dogen Zen says, "You should realize the moment.” You should understand the moment through and through. Otherwise you cannot arouse, otherwise you cannot awaken the body-mind. Do you understand? 

So, this is the moment in this book. So moment is the very delicate, continuous change of consciousness, still there. 

So, the most minute change of consciousness is still recognized even though the consciousness is tranquilized to the maximum. Therein, moment can be recognized. This is called moment. 

And this moment, how this moment produced, that is called the most, most minute change of consciousness. That minute, most minute consciousness is called *ignorance*. 

So *moment* is *ignorance*. You don't know from where the moment comes. That moment is, in terms of that change of the most minute change of consciousness can be seen in terms of the time, it is called moment. And then when you try to see the thought of the moment from where it comes, at that time it is called *ignorance*. And that ignorance is happening always, constantly, suddenly. 

So, look at the page 50 of this book. The second paragraph. It says, 

> What is called the essential nature of Mind is always beyond thoughts. It is, therefore, defined as "immutable". When the one World of Reality is yet to be realized, the Mind is mutable and is not in perfect unity with Suchness. Suddenly, a deluded thought arises; this state is called ignorance.

Real nature of consciousness is completely that which is unborn or immutable, impenetrable, but it is closely connected with ignorance, so-called discriminating mind, constantly. So that discriminating mind leaves constantly a trace of the minute change of consciousness behind you. Or, right in the middle of calmness, still there is minute change of consciousness there. That is called *moment*. Then you realize moment. You realize the time. Then, psychologically if you look at this, this is called ignorance. 

And then, this ignorance happens with no reason. No reason. Only time is arranged, conditions are ripe, it happens. So, very naturally, Buddhism doesn't say from where ignorance comes. It is beginningless. 

So, ignorance is not exactly, not absolutely, not the idea of original thing. Some people misunderstand ignorance as original thing. So, ignorance is no beginning. We don't know from where it comes. Means, source of ignorance is really vast. Alright? It's vast. So, no “avocado seed”, something like fixed source, no fixed source. It's vast, beginningless. But, if so, if it's doesn’t have a source of the ignorance, we don't know from where it comes. So, if so, it's impossible to have ignorance right now, because it doesn't have any source from which it appears now. Intellectually. Do you understand? But, intellectually it's impossible, but [actually there]. So, always there. 

Do you understand this one? Always there, ignorance is there, but if you try to look back to the source, we try to trace to the source of the ignorance, we don't know from where it comes. It's vast. So, completely it's not original thing. It's not something controlled by a third person. 

For instance, there is fourteen people there, comparing to the watch. One person is here, and two try to make all same watch. And then one person controls. So-called the everyone, in order to make all watch in the same watch, there is one common universal person, characteristic, that is called ignorance, alright? It's thinking that way. And then you can make same watch. At that time, well it's easy to, if you think that ignorance, you don't like that ignorance, it's very easy to destroy, because you can know who makes it. So, you can argue, you can sue that person. Do you understand? But if you don't, if you don't know who makes it, who you should sue? Who you want to sue? Nobody. So, nothing; only one thing you have to know. You have to know that, you have to, the characteristic of ignorance which is appearing, disappearing, constantly in your everyday life. Through and through. That's it. You should handle this. 

That is the point that this book [says], okay? So, in this section, the mind in terms of phenomena, we have to research this minute change of consciousness, ok? It's very interesting. That is because this is ignorance, so-called. But this ignorance is completely no trace, beginningless. But it's always there. 

Hai.

**Question:** Could you say something about the storehouse consciousness that this book mentioned in page 47? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yeah, [...] maybe next time I can explain storehouse consciousness, alright? That is exactly same idea as tathagatagarbha. Buddha is operating constantly in every one of you. Not only human beings, all sentient beings. But this buddha-nature is still connected with all sentient beings. It means that buddha-nature is not separate from the human world. That buddha-nature is total dynamic working. Where it works? It's in the samsaric world. That's why Buddha connects to outside world. Alright? 

But in terms of human beings, human eyes, if you look at that human consciousness, you say consciousness is dirty. But I don't think Buddhism doesn't see in that way. Still, the nature of the consciousness is very pure. That's why the pure nature of all consciousness. It's really. But this is, problem is this pure nature of consciousness is covered with delusion, discriminating mind. But this pure nature of consciousness, own-consciousness, is never contaminated by discriminating mind. This is called *tathagatagarbha*. Okay? And then how it's connected, this book explains. That is called defilement, defiledness, undefiledness. They’re both connected. This is tathagatagarbha. And then if it's connected in human life, how can we be free from this? Combination of the defiledness or undefiledness. This is the teaching of this book. 

So, if you understand a little bit the idea of time, okay? Time mean actually nothing. Nothing. *[He chuckles.]* Actually, no time. But when you are human being, time is there. So who creates time? *You* create. That's why you have to take initiative: because *you* create time.
