**Katagiri Roshi:** I think most of you have lots of questions, or big doubt, to practice the *shikantaza* we do, “just sitting,” if you attend various workshops, various seminars of yoga and Christianity, many other things. Because the practice we do is *too simple* to touch the heart. It’s very difficult. On the other hand, if you attend workshops, seminars of other things, you can see very clearly lots of benefits, instructions. So immediately you think, why do you do *this*? It's wasting time. 

This is natural. Most of people have these questions. 

And then most people try to ignore this kind of simple practice, and then get to the fascinating spiritual life, and mysterious experience of spiritual life, in order to satisfy individual desires. But on the other hand, the true reality would be completely reversed. Whatever kind of experience you have, good feeling or bad feeling, the true reality would be completely reversed, because it is constantly changing. So you never touch what is the true reality you live in, in your life. So still the experience you feel through the workshop, zazen, whatever you do, doesn't hit the mark, because it's very shaky. Because if you feel good through zazen, then next moment what kind of a good feeling have you had? Is it very stable? Next moment, it's gone. So whatever kind of feelings you have experienced through the practice, I think whatever experience is very shaky, changeable. So that's why people are more restless, and then are more greedy to get something to let them settle down. But unfortunately, the more you try to settle yourself, the more [...] you feel [...] unstable feeling, always. That's why endlessly you have to do. This is called, we say, *samsara*. [The] circle of repetition, always. 

But finally, no matter how long you do [it], that's fine. Individual, okay? That's fine. You can make a choice. But I think finally what you come to the conclusion of is how to live, right now, right here. That's it. Completely beyond understanding what your life is, or even though you don't understand what the life is. Even though you don't have any knowledge of life, Buddhism, religion, psychology, yoga, anyway, the question is, how do you live in peace and harmony, day to day, right now, right here, with inpeturbable state of mind. That's it. This is life. This is death.

So in Buddhism, life and death are not different. Life is exactly death, death is exactly life. So what is death? Can you do something? Is there some benefit to make your life feel relief by [a] teaching, by your experience, by somebody else? Can you? Nothing. So all you have to do is, be present in the stream of death, and also make your life stable, and just live there. 

What is that? Is there anything beneficial from outside or inside, or spiritually, or philosophically, or psychologically – can you get something? 

Pay careful attention to this, okay? I tell you: nothing, exactly nothing. 

What you can do is, there is one thing you can do: that is how you can live, right now, right here. Right in the midst of the stream of death, how can you live? That's all you can do. Nothing else. This is life. 

When you sit down, how can you live? Right in the middle of *doing* zazen, in peace and harmony with the people, with the whole world, how can you do this? Not an analytical matter of zazen, or not an analytical understanding of the self who is doing zazen. No. 

Analysis of Zazen, analysis of the self, philosophy of the self comes *after* you [are] really living in peace and harmony day by day. Then, it's coming up. That is called *teaching* or *thought*. 

So, I understand. I don't ignore [that] you want to learn something else in order to get the benefit for your life. Of course, you can do [it]. But remember, human beings are pretty weak, but on the other hand, human beings are strong, but on the other hand, human beings are not so strong. So if you start to do something else from which you can really feel good, you are completely tossed away, you go off from the right course, so-called living in peace and harmony, day to day, step by step. You completely go off. Finally, you forget, and then you become crazy, the teaching beneficial, and et cetera. This is human world. We look at this.

People say that the truth is one, so whatever kind of religion you believe, that's fine. I think religion is not so simple.

Of course you can make a choice, because truth is one, and all kind of religion try to get that truth. But a point is, different religions are exactly different ways to reach that point, *one*. So you have to make a choice, what kind of way to reach that peak. 

But if you make a choice one way, can you go [the] straight way, without going astray? Can you go [the] straight way to the destination, to the peak? 

No. If there are ten people, ten people accept the one way in ten different ways. And also, in the process of the moving toward the peak, circumstances [are] changing, your feeling, emotions are changing, and then we don't know what happens next moment. So very naturally, *no one* can go straight exactly, without going zigzag. Do you understand that? 

Now Buddha teaches us, you should go straight. Okay? Here is this shore, the other shore there. How can you reach there? That is Buddha's teaching. But when you start to walk, we don't know when we can reach. But we can see over there, we can see the destinations. So we try to move. But there is no guarantee when we can reach [them]. No. But all we can do is, we have to move toward that destination, if you can see the, you know, peak. Because Buddha mentions. So anybody wants to go, if you see. 

So I think religion is not so simple. Even though you make a choice of one way to reach the peak – so-called Buddhism, or Christianity, or yoga, whatever, you choose one – it's not so simple. 

So what makes your life not simple? That is *you yourself*, who takes care of a way to reach. So what is the problem? Problem is this person, *you*. Everyone. Who has emotions, feelings, karmas – anyway heredity, education... This person is very important. 

You know that [person] in the Minneapolis, president of Humphrey Institute in Minneapolis. I forgot his name. I think the last month, he wrote an interesting essay in the newspaper. He mentions, he tried to find something wonderful without government, you know, he tried to find what is the best way to live in the human world without government. *[He laughs.]* Well, it's nice, you know? But anyway, he said that lately, the amazing fact to him is that the United States has been supported by information, almost 90%, you know, information [of] the whole world. Can you believe it? Yes it is. 

So how much information comes? Not only from the United States, whole world. Immediately United States can get lots of information, and then she can know how to live. So that is the development of United States in the political sense, in economical sense, in many ways. This is modern civilization. 

But still there is a question. *[He laughs.]* Okay? This question is not yet solved. That is, person who takes care of information, how does a person deal with this enormous information? That's it. If you make one mistake – it's a *big* mistake coming up. 

This is modern civilization. Look at the computers. If you make one mistake, it's a huge problem. 

You know, when I came back from Japan this time, in May, you know, the computer always checks my ticket, whether it was right or wrong. She checked my ticket, but she couldn't find my name. So she said, “You cannot take this airplane.” Why not? In the morning of that day, I called the airport to make a confirmation, and she said fine, I found your name. Then I went to the airport and then the stewardess put in the key, you know, of the computer, but she couldn't find my name. So she said you couldn't get this airplane. And then I said why? Because she said, now this airplane is already booked up. But my name is one of the passengers by whom that airplane has been booked up, you know! *[He laughs.]* But she couldn't find the name, so my name is completely the outside of the passengers in the list. So finally, I always emphasize, please find anyway. I don't understand your reason, you know? So finally the many people were murmuring... *[Laughter.]* I heard the murmuring says, “Probably his ticket is too cheap.” *[Laughter.]* That's ridiculous! Finally she said, “Maybe, his ticket is too cheap, that's why.” Well, I was very surprised! *[He laughs.]* But anyway, I want to get that airplane, because it's already booked, you know, I got the information from the airport! And then finally she said, “I'm sorry, computer didn't work.” Computer mistake. That's it. 

So even though you can get the lots of information, but *who* takes care of [it]? If you make one mistake when you [key in the information], then it's a big problem. 

So I think still there is a big problem. We have to find the perfect solution, is this person, human, okay? Who really wants to deal with that information. 

Not only the computer. Particularly when you sit down, you can know how much information comes from your head. So your head is not a small head, your head is really extending into the past, present and future. So your head starts to spin. *[He laughs.]* And getting lots of thoughts. [Don’t you notice this]? And then finally, what do you do? Can you believe your zazen, what you are doing right now, right here? Nobody. Because completely the person who is sitting right now right here, and seeing and getting lots of information from the past, present, future, and then he or she is completely carried away by information. Where is the subjectivity? No subjectivity who [is] taking care of the information. The person is already confused by the information, so how can you deal with the information properly? 

So that is a big problem, okay? That's why in zazen, whatever you think – throw away good and bad, pros and cons. Throw away, anyway. All you have to do is just sit down right now, right here. But you cannot do it, you don't believe it! When you are in the stream of doing zazen, this is exactly same as the state of death. When you are dying, what can you think? Whatever you think, nothing helps you. 

This is zazen, when you do it. 

At that time, the only one way you can do it, and also open, completely open for everyone, whoever you are, that is you can do. How do you live right now as you? Without being carried away by lots of information from your head, from the past, future, and present. That is the state of the posture of zazen. That's why it is too simple to know. It's really pretty close. Very important matter of life and death. But people don't believe.

#### 20:55

I think that we often compare the thoughts in our head to clouds in the vast openness of sky. 

The clouds in the sky sometimes come and go with fascinating clearness. Sometimes the black clouds run wild in the sky. There is a storm... tornadoes... Sometimes we think such a wonderful thing in our head that we put the buddhas, bodhisattvas, wise men, and saints to blush. *[A few people laugh.]* Sometimes we think such a horrible thing that we put the murderer into the shade. 

The sky embraces any kind of clouds and lets them play freely. The sky is never carried away by the clouds of our thought. Imperturbability in living our life, day to day, from moment to moment, settles in the vast openness of sky. This is zazen. 

We are not puffed up with pride because of the experience of seeing the fascinating cloud of the Buddha's face, and the beautiful bodhisattva's face, and *satori*, and enlightenment, mysterious experience, et cetera. We are never puffed up with pride. We are not discouraged because things do not turn out as we wish. 

The point is, that we should constantly keep the posture straight, in seeing both sides: experience of *satori*, experience of not-*satori*. We have to constantly see both. But basically, you should keep your body and mind completely in balance. 

In other words, you should constantly put yourself in the vast openness of sky, which is never tossed away by many thoughts. *Thoughts* means experience of *satori* or not-*satori*. Thoughts means that there is much information from the past, present, future – what you have experienced, what you are experiencing, what you will experience. Whatever it is, [much] information coming up if you sit down. Immediately. Your body is very small, okay? Occupying small square cushions. But how much information comes, from how vast it comes? It's huge. The whole universe, it's coming, constantly. That's why you can think of planets which you have never been to. Even though you don't know what the planet is, you can think of it. If you sit down, you are amazed what is the contents of your head, what is the contents of your life. It's amazing! It's huge information coming, constantly. Something more than teletype. Very quick. You can never stay with one information, because the information comes one after another, from moment to moment, so you have to deal with it. So that's why you become very busy with dealing with all those informations. Finally, we don't know how to deal with [them].

Of course, we have to deal with the information, but the point is not within the information, but the point is within *you* who takes care of the information. That's why you shouldn't be carried away by the information. *First* you have to settle yourself in the vast openness of sky. *Then* you can see the clouds. 

Fascinating clearness of sky. Sometimes, completely black clouds. You have to see both. 

So, this is the sitting zazen we do. I don't mean I should ignore what you want to do. Yes, you should do it. But remember, if you start to do something, you are slowly – or sometimes quickly – going astray, going off from the main point of life and death. You don't know. Because it's fascinating! It makes your life fascinating, if you start to do something. 

That is a teaching. So teaching always gives you lots of information. If you don't believe, study the *Abhidharmas*, and the *Avatamsaka Sutra*, the [*Vijnana Bhairava*], whatever. Fascinating teaching there. Even in Buddhism, you are completely carried away by those teachings. You don't know how to deal with the *mind*, consciousness. It's amazing, you don't know. It's huge. That's why you have to constantly poke your head into the consciousness, and try to research what the consciousness is. That's too much! Because you go far, far away from the key point: how to live day to day. 

[...] Some teaching tells us anger comes from a certain portion of your body, and then, when you sit down, please pay attention to that portion, and then anger turns into energies of your whole body, so you feel good. Yes; you can do it. But I don't think it is a final conclusion. No. Because anger is really something alive. So all of a sudden anger is coming up, you don't know why. Do you understand? 

You sit zazen there, apparently peaceful, but I don't think inside it's peaceful. You don't know what's going on there. You don't expect it before you do zazen. But something happens, and also anger from the bottom of your life coming up. How can you deal with that anger, hatred? 

It's not a matter of discussion. Right in the middle of anger – even though you can see the shadow of anger, please sit down in peace and harmony, *right now*, even for a moment, without being carried away by the shadow of anger. 

Do you understand that? This is life and death. You see always the shadow of death, when you are in the stream of death. This is human beings. If you are there [and] you don't see the shadow of death, you are not human beings. 

If I see you, maybe I feel some emotions. Sure, it is true! If you don't feel anything, you are not human beings. 

So Buddha says you should accept *first* feeling, but don't be carried away by second feeling. It’s pretty important, this one. Okay? How many feelings? Second, third, fourth? *[Laughter.]* Finally, you don't care! *[He laughs.]* Because pretty enjoy. So finally, people say, “forget it,” you know, “just enjoy.” People say so! And then if you say “just enjoy,” you completely fall away first emotions, first feelings. 

But a first feeling can be accepted by *anybody* if you're human beings. You cannot ignore. But even though you see the shadow of death through that first feeling, all you have to do is, don't be tossed away by second, third feeling of death. Do you understand that? “Not being tossed away by second feeling of death” means to live. To live fully, now. That's all you can do. 

To be free, right now. It's *so* simple... but it's not so simple for us, because human beings are *very* complicated. I don't know why. It is already. [We are that way already]. So you should take care of it. You should learn that human being, okay? 

So someone says Zen Buddhism ignores the human emotions or feelings. No, I don't. It's not correct. Okay? If you practice Zen Buddhism like this, very naturally you can understand very deeply human feelings, human emotions. And then you can share your feelings, your emotions with the people. Okay? 

But it's very difficult for you to understand this, because you have never experienced before. But even though you don't understand, I have to continue to [talk] about this, and also I want to encourage you to do this practice. Okay? 

So that's why we need help. Just like a baby. Baby is stumbling, but she or he cannot stop walking. So that's why by the baby, fathers, mothers, daughters, brothers must watch. Let's walk together. 

This is compassion, okay?

[...] Today I have my son's wedding, from one o'clock. I didn't invite all of you, but in my heart I really want to invite all of you, because I really appreciate all of you very deeply. Anyway, it's time for my son to get married. When he came to Minneapolis, he was six... no, twelve...

**Someone:** Ten.

**Katagiri Roshi:** Oh, ten. Thank you. *[Everyone laughs.]* Now, he is 25. I really appreciate all of you for your kindness, to help to support my life and my son's. Thank you very much.
