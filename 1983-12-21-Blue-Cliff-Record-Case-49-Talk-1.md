**Katagiri Roshi:** The Pointer:

> Piercing, penetrating, one takes the drum and captures the flag. Fortified, entrenched, one inspects the front and oversees the rear.

First one: “piercing, penetrating, one takes the drum and captures the flag,” means offense of the fortress, as an example. Second one, “fortified, entrenched, one inspects the front and oversees the rear.” It means defense of the fortress. 

The “piercing, penetrating, one takes the drum and captures the flag.” [...] Defense and offense, both exist simultaneously in our lives. “Piercing, penetrating”: when you try to educate, when you try to teach somebody, anyway, you have to pierce. “You have to pierce” means you have to hit the drum, and take away the flag of [egoism]. Means we have to, with the word piercing means, even if you use one word, one word must be pierced into the human heart. And also, that education must be penetrated to others, that means your education with words, with the mind, with the attitude, must be based on *compassion*, otherwise you cannot penetrate. 

So, here it says one takes the drum, that means using the expedient ways, expedient methods: words, physical actions, and also thinking. Anyway, we can approach to the people, and teach, and educate. Simultaneously, that way, the expedient method, must penetrate the other’s life. So that is *offense*, offense of the fortress.

When you teach, positively you have to teach, you have to educate. Initiatively, you have to move toward. For this, that education or teaching requires kindness, compassion. In other words, true heart, looking to human life for the long run. And then teach, you have to teach. Even though you use one word which is very piercing into the other people’s heart, but it is not something “piercing,” because it is based on compassion. Compassion lets you see human life, your life and others life for the long run. Otherwise, your education, your teaching, your presence doesn’t penetrate others. 

That’s why, anyway, positively you have to take care of your life, and also you have to teach others’ life. 

In order to teach others, simultaneously you have to, what would you say, defend yourself. Against external, internal attacks. That means, externally, internally, there are many things. So you have to know, you have to know, there are many things externally, you have to know many things internally. Means you have to know yourself, your past life, and present life, future life, and also front and back, and to the right, to the left – you have to know many things. And then you can defend yourself against external and internal attack.

If you read the *Diamond Sutra*, it always mentions bodhisattva’s life, which they always are careful to take care of their life, watching over the many things externally, internally. So they don’t fall into a pit for own purpose, anyway, or consciously. Even though you are very careful of taking care of your life, watching over the front and back, and to the right, to the left, nevertheless you easily fall into the pitfall before you are conscious of them. So this is very common. Before you are conscious of them, you fall into the pitfall. In other words, multiple obstacles. 

Well, I was pretty often asked by the people to try to test a new one, you know, something drugs. Particularly in the 1970s, people tried to let me experience drugs and marijuana, et cetera. But fortunately, I knew a little bit what is marijuana and any kind of drugs that people were interested in. That’s why I didn’t take it. Well, if you know something pretty well, before you act toward that, well, it’s not necessary to do. But many people believe that you should experience everything. No, you cannot experience everything, okay? If you try to experience everything, it makes you confused. Because if you act, the result of your action becomes ghost, anyway. Something more than you have expected. That is actions. So, if you know something very clearly, [something] dangerous, something unwholesome, I don’t think it’s necessary to go there. If you go there, sometimes you become the insect in the summer, jumping into the fire. So, committing suicide. It’s very common. That’s why people are very suffering anyway, suffering from their life very much. 

So, “Fortified, entrenched, one inspects the front and oversees the rear.” That is a bodhisattva life, to watch over many things in front and in the back of your life. And then, nevertheless, there are lots of obstacles, dangerous situations there. So, if you know pretty well human life, not only the many things you can see objectively or externally, you have to learn yourself, surrounded by the countless number of feelings, emotions going on inside of your life. That is a human being. And those feelings are acting very subtly, and also sometimes very [greedily], sometimes very wonderfully, or sometimes painfully. So, you should know the human feelings, human emotions. 

So, many things going on inside. So, that’s why, “fortified, entrenched, one inspects the front and oversees the rear.” And then, if you understand yourself, at that time you can accept yourself as a human being, looking at yourself for the long run. And then you understand others too. 

So, very naturally, you can accept yourself smoothly. And if you accept yourself, which is called “defense of your fortress,” then very naturally you act initiatively, you can live yourself initiatively. That is “offense of the fortress” in your life. 

When I was a child, I had a very bad habit. Particularly in the winter, I went to the school, but it was cold – not much, not like this in Minneapolis, it was pretty mild, but lots of snow. And then on the way to the school, I felt my foot cold, so I quit going to school, and crying, and went back home. I was always scolded by my father. And also, that is one point, the second point was that I always felt tired. I always felt tired when I came back from the school, so I sat down at the bottom of the stairs, and then always I sighed loudly. So my father scolded me: “Don’t sigh! Stop sighing.” 

And after that, when I went to the high school, I practiced *judo*. That practice of judo was pretty good for me, because I can use myself very initiatively, instead of waiting for something to do, or always accepting myself, you know, not initiatively, always withdrawing, looking at myself objectively. That’s why consciously, unconsciously, I criticized myself, so that’s why criticism made me tired. Even a child does in that way. So, that’s why my father scolded me very much, but I didn’t understand. So, when I went to high school, we had to practice judo with no excuse. That was pretty good medicine for me, because I did something positively, initiatively, using my life. There was no chance to look at myself objectively, criticizing myself. So, that was pretty good for me. So I realized, I can do something. I can do something positively. I can do something pretty good. So since then I didn’t feel tired so much. The practice of judo was very hard work, physically, but I didn’t feel tired. So, since then, I really understand myself, that I should do something positively. Positively or initiatively, anyway – moving towards something by myself. Concentrating on jumping in there, and finish, achieve something. Even though I cannot do it. Well before you do, always there is two questions: I can do, I cannot do. But anyway, let’s do it. But don’t do it blindly. As best as you can, you have to know, you have to understand something, well, as clearly as possible, as much as possible. But still you cannot see the clear answer, [whether] you can do or you cannot do. But you should start to do. And then it’s pretty good for us. 

But most of people don’t do this. Always criticize, because always try to get some answer, clear answer. I can do, I cannot do. Sometimes. Sometimes you can see; sometimes there is something you cannot know. 

So, since then, even the answer, “yes, I did,” always the answer loudly and “yes” and positively, very much. But even the answer is very important. If you say “yes,” that’s it, you know. Very naturally your life is something like that. But if you say yes, very positively and loudly, with confidence, you can do it. You can do something. So that spirit is very important. 

So, for this, you should accept totally yourself, who you are. Pretty weak. Human beings are pretty weak. And human beings possess lots of karmic life you don’t know, anyway. Karmic life leads you to go in a completely different direction which you have never thought before. That is karmic life, anyway. When you are born, immediately there is a karmic life with you. From this point, you cannot escape from your karmic life, which something set up, exactly. For this, you have to accept totally karmic life. In that time, you can defend yourself against attack, externally or internally. And then, simultaneously to defend yourself means to do something positively. 

So that is, it says, “Piercing, penetrating, one takes the drum and captures the flag. Fortified, entrenched, one inspects the front and oversees the rear.” So defense and offense are not two. Simultaneously there; if you defend yourself, it is simultaneously you do something positively. If you do something positively, well, that is simultaneously you defend yourself against. In other words, you protect yourself. For long run, looking at your life for long run, you protect. 

#### 22:40

> One who sits on the tiger’s head to take the tiger’s tail is not yet an adept. 

“One who sits on the tiger’s head to take the tiger’s tail” is to do something perfectly. To act, to achieve something perfectly. That is, to sit on the tiger’s head to take the tiger’s tail. When you teach somebody, your teachings, your actions, is perfect. But, even though it is perfect, it’s not good enough. Because... if you believe that your life is perfect, simultaneously you create cracks, from which the core air blows in. Because there is no space, which is called flexibility. You have to see both offense and defense, defense and offense. Both working simultaneously. But if you always believe that your life is perfect, at that time, you always see the one side of your life, so-called offense. So, there is no compassion. You have to defend. To defend yourself means to have compassion. Understanding deeply yourself and others. At that time you can defend yourself. Then you can teach, you can go toward others. 

So, that’s why here it says, “One who sits on the tiger’s head to take the tiger’s tail is not yet an adept.” It’s not perfect. It’s not good enough. 

> Though an ox head disappears and a horse head returns, this too is not yet extraordinary.

The ox’s head disappears and a horse’s head returns means to do something very quickly. Very quickly, very smartly. Very swiftly, rapidly. You can teach, you can give some impression to the people with a word. 

Well, you can see such a person. [...] he is very smart. He uses words very good, very good. So, people are very impressed by his words. So, that is a teaching, pretty good. Very quickly. If you read this koan, then you have to give the words, you have to act very quickly, rapidly. But, it is perfect. It can really piercing into the people’s heart. But here it says nevertheless, it is not good enough. 

> But say, how is it when a man who has passed beyond measurements comes? To test I’m citing this old case: look!

#### 28:07

> San Sheng asked Hsueh Feng, ...

San Sheng was one of the Linji’s, Rinzai’s master. 

> ... “I wonder, what does the golden fish who has passed through the net use for food?”

That means, when you attain enlightenment, when you become Buddha, or when you become a saint, what kind of food do you eat? Do you eat air? Or do you eat the usual food other people do? What kind of food do you eat? So, that is the question. “I wonder, what does the golden fish who has passed through the net,” means passed through the net of the Buddhas, and enlightenment, or delusion, or ordinary people, or Buddha, and may completely go beyond. And then you can experience so-called freedom, perfect freedom, or peace. So, that is a golden fish. At that time you become a golden fish. So, what does the golden fish who has passed through the net use for food? 

> Feng said, “When you come out of the net I’ll tell you.”

San Sheng’s experience saying like this was wonderful, very smart, and sharp question, because he experienced this one: nirvana, perfect preedom. But Feng said, “When you come out of the net, I will tell you.” Means, his answer was pretty basic, it’s not a real answer. But, he said like this means that, he realized that San Sheng already sat on the chair of his enlightenment, even for a moment. But, he didn’t realize it. 

For instance, Gungyo Zen Master was asked, Zen Master was asked by the monk, saying, “I have nothing to carry on my back, what should I drop off?” In other words, he attained enlightenment, so-called nothing. “I have carried nothing.” And then the Zen Master says, “Put down that nothing.” But, he said, “I have already carried nothing on my back, what should I put down?” The Zen Master says, “Please go home with carrying that one.” Do you understand? “Go back home with nothing.” Means, he didn’t understand nothing. Nothing to carry, but he already carried enough something, so-called nothing. Do you understand? 

For instance, I say, “Don’t think.” So, you try not to think, it means already thinking. Same thing, same applies to this, the question. “I have nothing to carry,” but the Zen Master says, “Put down nothing here.” But, he says, “I have nothing to put down, what should I put down?” So, Zen Master says, “If you think so, well, you should carry it back to your home.” If you think how important nothing is for you. So, he always carried the nothing. But, not to carry the nothing means no more nothing. It’s already something. 

So, same applies to here too. So [San Sheng] experiences that wonderful [nirvana], freedom. So, he said, “What does the golden fish who passes through the net use for food?” Means, already he carried. He has carried the golden fish. 

So, that’s why Feng said, “When you come out of the net, I will tell you.” Once again, you should come out of the net. 

#### 34:03

And then,

> Sheng said, “The teacher of fifteen hundred people and you don’t even know what to say!”

At that time it is said that [Feng] had “twenty five hundred monks,” and many monks practicing under him. So, here says, “The teaching, that’s why you are a great teacher, because under you, there are many students practicing together.” So, he says, “The teacher of fifteen hundred people, you are a great Zen teacher, but you don’t know what to say.” That is really, what would you say... kind of mean. Meanness. 

But, 

> Feng said, “My affairs as abbot are many and complicated.”

It means, “My task as abbot makes me busy, so I don’t have enough time to discuss about it with you now.” So, he said he left. 

And that answer is, it’s not a real answer, but he exactly had great skillful methods, so-called [...]. Sometimes he had a skillful method, so-called, “thought.” On the other hand, “power.” What is “cape”? 

So, in the commentary, it says,

> When these adepts met, there was one capture and one release...

You have to capture, you have to take something, what you have to teach, you have to give. You have to give. In order to give, you have to take people, anyway, grasp him or her, and give. Simultaneously, you have to release. Let it go, anyway. 

So, that [is the meaning of], “When these adepts met, there was one capture and one release.” 

You can do it. For instance, a friend of mine, Yokoi Roshi, always taught me many things, but one side of his life taught me was very, what would you say, strict. Always, he captured me. When he captured me, he never released me. He immediately captured me. But on the other hand, he released me. He let me free, always. That means compassion, always there is compassion. 

So, I was pretty mad at him, but simultaneously I cannot escape from this, because there is a release. But he didn’t actually let me go, but I myself let go, because I can see his really deep compassion in his life toward me. So, that’s why, if you educate somebody, or if you teach, if you see somebody, if you meet somebody, anyway, you have to always take somebody. Otherwise, you cannot devote yourself to do something initiatively. So, you should take something, anyway, grasp it. But it’s not egoistic. You have to release it, let it go. It means, you need, it requires you, very deep understanding. That is compassion. And then you can feel, you can take a deep breath there, and also you can let the others take a deep breath. That is simultaneously there. And then you can teach. 

*[Tape change.]*

> ... – (each) acted weak when encountering strength and acted noble when encountering meanness. If you form your understanding in terms of victory and defeat, you haven’t seen Hsueh Feng even in dreams.

“Each acted weak when encountering strength.” When you see somebody always expressing his strength in front of you, you cannot fight, anyway. At that time, you should accept him very smoothly. In order to do this, you act weak. You cannot fight. If you fight with him or her, very naturally you express strength. So, strength to strength, always fighting – no end of fighting. So if you see somebody expressing his strength, you act weak. That means, don’t fight with him or her. Very simply, softly, you can do. 

On the other hand, each “acted noble when encountering meanness.” You can experience such a situation always. There are some individuals who are always mean to you. Fool yourself, fool others, using the meanness, words. 

I experienced that one, [...] seven years ago, when I was on Fifth Street, Southeast, one of the Japanese college students, University of Minnesota, who studied science. He came with his friends visiting me and said, immediately, one first words was that, “Are you a Zen master? If you are a Zen master, you attain enlightenment? You are enlightened person?” This is first  words. That is so-called “meanness.” *[Laughter.]* It’s really mean. If you fight with this kind of words, you become mean. So, no end of fighting. 

So, I said, in the life, there are two things simultaneously exist in your life, defense and offense. But, there is no sense of victory or defeat. That means you shouldn’t fight, anyway. When somebody really attacks strongly, well, you should withdraw. Withdraw is not withdraw, not lose. But, if some person is pretty weak, sometimes you should push. Push in or push out. Do something initiatively. Somebody really puts you down, well, you should be noble. Anyway, you should be very noble, gentle, compassionate, and patient. Around your life, there are many people who put you down always, don’t you think? With words, with action. At that time, you shouldn’t “bark” at him or her always. Don’t bark back. Even though people bark at you, don’t bark back. Them, or he or she, anyway. You should be always noble. 

So, that’s why Zen Master Feng said, “My affairs as the abbot are many and complicated.” And he left! Anyway, he left. 

So, both Zen Masters were pretty good in this koan. But, they are not discussing about the victory or defeat. Both are great Zen teachers. The important point is, you cannot fight each other. You shouldn’t fight. But both Zen Masters accept very smoothly a certain situation, expressing his noble attitude toward a person who is expressing meanness. Just accept the situation, instead of fighting. So, this is very important. 

So, from this point, San Sheng accepts his experience, but instead of expressing his strength, anyway, he should express nobility. Gentle, because, he expressed his strength because he really realized great nirvana, freedom. Which is strength. So, he expresses strength when encountering strength. That is called sitting on the chair of nirvana, enlightenment. You cannot do that. That’s why in Buddhism, always you achieve a certain stage, and you should stand up from that seat and move. Then you reach a certain stage, and you should stand up from *that* seat and move. Instead of always staying there. You cannot do it. 

So, constantly, you have to do it. If you do something, very naturally, you can get result, anyway. But you cannot stay with the result always. Even the good, even the bad. Stand up quickly, as soon as possible, and move. Walking straightly. 

So, that is the meaning of this case. 

Do you have a question? 

#### 48:47

**Question:** Hojo-san?

**Katagiri Roshi:** *Hai.*

**Questioner:** In several years of listening to talks about Zen, I have never heard talk about taking initiative before. I’m curious, why is it that this is the first time? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Zen is pretty... Zen is a kind of a way of living, of taking initiative. For instance, the expression is different, [but] Zen says, “Be master of yourself in whatever situation you may be.” This is a way to live your life initiatively. Do you understand? 

But taking initiative doesn’t mean to rush into a certain destination blindly. People usually say, “You should do something positively.” That means people always do something positively – pretty good, but they don’t understand the human life in the broadest perspective, [but] with pretty narrow understanding. And then if you take initiative in your life, it’s trouble. Do you understand the difference? 

#### 50:50

**Question:** I have a question. You said if you know something before, you don’t need to get into to experience about that. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Mm-hmm.

**Questioner:** But I was thinking that just the knowledge and experiencing something is a totally different thing. 

**Katagiri Roshi:**  Yes, totally different. But you should know also something which happens totally different, before you think, on the way to experience. On the way to experience, sometimes something happens totally different which you have never thought before. You should know this, too. 

**Questioner:** *[Unintelligible.]*

**Katagiri Roshi:** Experience is important. I don’t mean you *shouldn’t* experience. Sometimes you *have to* experience, even though you know what it is before you do. Okay? Sometimes you have to do. But sometimes, not everything. [...] So that’s why you have to consider carefully, well, something ... whether you should do it or you shouldn’t do it. Understanding yourself and also your object. Because, for instance, they take marijuana and drugs. One of the Zen teachers was forced by the students to take marijuana, and then he became a sick. Because he was interested in tasting. But he was sick. But I don’t think it’s necessary to become sick, anyway. So, if you know what the marijuana is, oh fantastic, wonderful, in a sense, wonderful. But you should know who you are, physically or mentally, anyway. Okay? And also you should know what the marijuana is. Sometimes people attain enlightenment, kind of enlightenment, by taking marijuana, of course. But it’s not universal, anyway. *[Laughter.]* It doesn’t fit to your life sometimes. 

Is that okay?

**Questioner:** ... Maybe this is a kind of stupid question, but about marijuana and, well, maybe there are some drugs. Assuming if you take that drug, you can attain enlightenment. And if you have enough of that drug through your whole life, so you can keep up your enlightenment, that’s your life. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Mm-mm. (No.) *[Laughter.]*

There is no guarantee. *[He laughs.]* 

**Questioner:** Yeah, but I just wonder, that enlightenment and the enlightenment by yourself, could be different? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Different from what? Enlightenment through Zen?

**Questioner:** Mm-hmm.

**Katagiri Roshi:** Oh... kind of. Pretty close, but not *exactly*. Pretty close. 

I know there are some people who attain enlightenment. I don’t know whether we should call it enlightenment or not. [...] Maybe there is some appropriate term, but I don’t know exactly. So, I say, let me say it, enlightenment. So, I know there are some people who attain actually anyway enlightenment through that. The point is that I mention always, whatever it is, you cannot sit on the chair of something. Okay? Always. Because always is, everything is changing. 

#### 56:05

**Questioner:** Hojo-san, I’m still confused by the question that... well, not necessarily marijuana or drugs, but just the thing of... how can you know about something before you’re dealing with it or have experience with it?

**Katagiri Roshi:** Through a book...

**Questioner:** Through a book? Well...

**Katagiri Roshi:** Through your common sense... You can know many ways. Can’t you?

**Questioner:** Sure. But then you can say, many people read about Zen before they come to Zen center or get involved. But when they’re reading, it’s not exactly it when you’re coming and are practicing. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yes, spiritual experience is something important to you, because you have to experience it. But religion is not always to taste water, always. Not to make experiments, always. Religion is to experience something, you should make experiment or you shouldn’t make experiment, both. Because you cannot make experiment of everything. Don’t you think? 

For instance, going to the moon. *[He laughs.]* How can you go to the moon? Now. Maybe next century, you will be able to go. If you survive. But now, no chance. But, you cannot ignore that situation, so in order to understand the human world, human beings very deeply, you have to know that human world, the human beings, which you can make experiment of them, and which you can make experiment, like going to the moon. Okay? 

*[Long pause.]*

Some people misunderstand Zen. Saying Zen teaching is to know by themselves, to know the water... to know that the water is cold. By drinking. Do you understand? It’s not Zen, anyway. Because to know something by your experience is something [parallel] to the human world, universe. Still there are many things you don’t know. But religion or Zen: if you say religion, religion must be something including the whole world, okay? You know, or you cannot know. Both. Anyway you should hold, include, whole thing. Nevertheless, you cannot be tossed away, you cannot [panic], even though you cannot know many things. But, you have to walk, stably, day to day, step by step, always. This is religious practice. And then learn, every day, step by step. 

*[Closing chant.]*
