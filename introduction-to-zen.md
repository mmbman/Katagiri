title: "Introduction to Zen"
---

This is a collection of talks in which Katagiri Roshi introduces the fundamentals of Buddhist practice, particularly of the Zen of Eihei Dogen, the 13th century founder of Soto Zen in Japan. Katagiri Roshi gave many other such introductory talks, but most of them are not yet available in the online audio archive. However, these few might serve as an entry point – perhaps a somewhat bracing one –  into the study of Dogen and the practice of Zen.

Topics covered here include fundamentals such as the meanings of the terms *zazen* (“sitting meditation”), *sanzen* (commonly translated as “the practice of Zen”), *shikantaza* (“just sitting”),  *sunyata* (or *kū*, “*emptiness*”), *shinjin datsuraku* (“dropping off body and mind”), and *zenki* (“the whole works”).

Ironically, the most challenging talk for Westerners, and perhaps even for those in other branches of Buddhism, might be the talk titled “Introduction to Buddhism” – because it primarily concerns the meaning of the word *faith* in Buddhism. Challenging or not, *faith* comes up often in both Dogen and Katagiri’s teaching, so it’s important to understand what it means in the context of Zen. (“Faith” is probably most often translating the Sanskrit word *śraddhā*, and it does seem to be an accurate translation... if a frequently misunderstood one.)

##### [Dogen: Four Points](1987-01-10-Dogen-Four-Points)

Katagiri Roshi explains Zen Master Dogen’s teaching in terms of four points: *realization of impermanence*, *shikantaza*, *liberation in action*, and *the whole works*. This short talk focuses on *realization of impermanence* and the meaning of *shikantaza*: zazen as *practice*.

##### [Introduction to Buddhism](1985-06-22-Introduction-to-Buddhism)

An alternative title for this talk might have been, “What Is Buddhist Faith?” What does *faith* mean in Buddhism, where the central philosophy is *emptiness*? Buddhist faith is intimacy with total dynamic working. Katagiri Roshi discusses how “the way we should practice within the intimacy between our lives and emptiness” is “to bear up, to enjoy, to desire, and to be limpid and clear.” Along the way, he talks about quarks, and driving on the freeway in Los Angeles.
