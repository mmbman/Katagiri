This is an index to where references to [Dogen](glossary#dogen)’s works appear in [Katagiri Roshi's](glossary#katagiri) talks. 

**Note**: This is an early work in progress, and it only includes talks I have transcribed. I will update it as I add new transcripts.

Fascicles from Shobogenzo referenced in Katagiri’s talks are listed below.

## Genjokoan

Genjōkōan – "Actualizing the Fundamental Point" – is one of the first and best-known of [Dogen's](glossary#dogen) works, and appears as an early chapter in [Shobogenzo](#shobogenzo). Genjokoan is both an introduction to and overview of Dogen's teachings, and as such is of primary importance in [Zen](glossary#zen) study.

# Eihei Koroku

Eihei Koroku is a collection of [Dogen Zenji](glossary#dogen)’s Dharma Hall Discourses (short dharma talks). 

There is now an English translation of the Eihei Koroku, but at the time the talks were given, there was not. Where Eihei Koroku discourses appear in the talks, it seems like that Katagiri Roshi translated them himself. 

The titles for these discourses are taken from [“Dōgen’s Extensive Record: A Translation of the Eihei Kōroku,”](books#eihei-koroku) translated by Taigen Dan Leighton and Shohaku Okumura. The titles did not originate with Dogen, but are useful for reference.
