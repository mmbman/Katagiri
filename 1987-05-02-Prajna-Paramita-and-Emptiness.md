In the Prajnaparamita Sutra of the 8000 Gatha. In other words, 8000 Gatha Prajnaparamita Sutra. Translated by Dr. Conze. Chapter 18, title is "Emptiness". There is an interesting discussion between the Buddha’s disciple and also Buddha. 

Subuti asked the Buddha, "How can one say that he begets the greater merit, since the Lord has described all accumulations as the result of false discrimination?" This is a question. How can one say that he begets the great merit since the Lord has described all accumulations as the merit of false discrimination? 

So if you practice the Buddha’s teaching then you can have a merit. Then the more you practice, the more we want to see that we can accumulate the merit. But that idea of accumulation of the merit is kind of a false understanding of Buddha’s teaching that [...] mentions. But he says, the Buddha says, if you practice the Buddha’s way you can accumulate merit, something like that. 

So that's why this is a question. Is that ok? And the answer, 

The Lord said, in that case also the accumulation of merit on the part of a bodhisattva who causes imperfect wisdom must be described as just empty, worthless, insignificant and unsubstantial. To the extent that a bodhisattva goes on contemplating all dharmas in this manner, to that extent he becomes one who does not lack imperfect wisdom. And to the extent that he doesn't lack imperfect wisdom, to that extent he begets an immeasurable, incalculable heap of merit. 

Let me read once more again. 

The Lord said, in that case all the accumulation of merit on the part of a bodhisattva who causes an imperfect wisdom must be described as just empty, worthless, insignificant and unsubstantial. To the extent that the bodhisattva goes on contemplating all dharmas in this manner, to that extent he becomes one who does not lack imperfect wisdom. And to the extent that he does not lack imperfect wisdom, to that extent he begets an immeasurable and incalculable heap of merit. 

I think in the *Prajnaparamita* we tend to usually think, we say, “Avalokiteshvara when he practices deeply the Prajnaparamita,” something like that. The me see... 

Avalokiteshvara bodhisattva when practicing deeply Prajnaparamita perceives that all five skandhas are empty and was saved from all suffering and distress. 

And toward the end we say, *gate gate pargate parasamgate bodhisvaha*. 

So in the Prajnaparamita two important points here. One is, Avalokiteshvara bodhisattva practices deeply Prajnaparamita. This is one point. The second, in this Heart Sutra, the last one, *gate gate pargate parasamgate bodhisvaha*: “gone, gone, gone beyond, gone altogether beyond.” According to the translation by Conze, it says “gone, gone, gone beyond, gone altogether beyond, oh what an awakening! All hail! This completes the heart of perfect wisdom.” This is a translation of gate gate: gone, gone, gone beyond, gone altogether beyond, oh! What an awakening. All hail! This completes the heart of perfect wisdom.”

 So two important points, okay? Bodhisattva has to practice Prajnaparamita. According to Conze's translation, he says “Avalokiteshvara bodhisattva as a symbol of compassion, or contents of Buddha's teaching, that is compassion. Avalokiteshvara was moving in the deep course of Prajnaparamita. He translated like this. That is one point. That is a very important point. Then you can experience something. 
 
If the participating in deep course of the Prajnaparamita is described as empty. Okay? Empty, insignificant and unsubstantial, something like that. So emptiness is secondary. Anyway. First important point is you have to participate in the deep course of Prajnaparamita. And then, if you do this, secondly you can describe this practice as emptiness. In other words you can describe, you can taste emptiness. 

Emptiness is a very delicate teaching. Emptiness: you cannot practice emptiness, you don't know what emptiness is, because always emptiness. So you don't know how to practice emptiness. So I think most important point in the Prajnaparamita Sutra, I think you have to participate, you are moving in the deep course of Prajnaparamita. Then, it is described as emptiness. Insignificant, worthless and unsubstantial. Like this. 

And then the second point is, you never separate from Prajnaparamita. You cannot lack, you cannot lack in perfect wisdom. So always you are with, you are with Prajnaparamita, always. This is the second point. 

So, first of all, Prajnaparamita, you have to move in the deep course of Prajnaparamita. That is perfect wisdom, we say. Well, deep, very deep, deep understanding. And then naturally you can love, you can share compassion naturally. If you really understand deeply, constantly deeply. You have to deepen your understanding again and again, day by day, whatever it is: good understanding, bad understanding, don't stay with a certain understanding of your own. Constantly you have to deepen. That's why the last sentence, “gate gate paragate parsamgate” means “gone, gone, gone beyond, gone altogether beyond.” Not only you, for all sentient beings, you have to go beyond. 

Why do you have to go beyond? If you understand something, then usually people are stuck in it. Or people always hold on their own understanding, believing this is right. Well, that is fine, but I think you shouldn't stay with a certain understanding. The point is to deepen constantly your understanding. For what? For you, and for all beings. That's why “gone altogether beyond,” you have to do. In order to live in peace and harmony in the human world, you have to do it. Beyond [whether] you like or you don't like. Anyway, this is our practice. That is Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva. That is moving in the deep course of prajnaparamita. 

Then you love it, you love others. Naturally, you love it. *You love* means you can share compassion with the people, which means you can be one with your object. And then, you can act. You can act. *You can act* means you can be one, practically, with people, with your object. Naturally, if you understand the trees very deeply, deeply in nature, you really share your compassion with the tree. Next, you can act. In other words, you can project your compassion into the tree. So you can be one with the tree at that time. What? That practice can be described as a poem, or as an art. Something like that. 

So, [the] important point is you have to constantly deepen, deepen every day, from day to day, your understanding, and then you can love. You can be one with the object. Naturally. Naturally you can share. It's vice versa. If you understand deeply, naturally you can love it. You can be compassionate to others. And [...] next, you can act, that means you can walk hand in hand with people. This is our actions, activities. 

So, understanding, compassion, and actions. Three become one. Interrelated, interpenetrated, naturally. This is moving in the deep course of Prajnaparamita. 

For instance, this is kind of a dancer, or any art. Think first of all of the dancers, the ones making the [birth] manifest itself in his or her performance. That is first. Second, the mature capacity manifests itself in his or her performance. That is the second. Third, ones making and performance improves, and achieves the consummation of the stabilized beauty. So, your dance becomes beautiful, beyond the word. 

So, three points. You have to understand, you have to deepen your understanding, your actions, your dance, your object, constantly. With your makings by birth, everyone is buddha. So, in the religious practice in the Zen monastery, whoever you are, if you are in the Zen monastery, you have to behave as a buddha. Beyond your self-centered ideas, like or dislike. Anyway, please, behave as a buddha. Buddha is very compassionate. Buddha is a person who really awakens deeply. Human world, human beings, trees, pebbles, and all living beings. And then, very naturally, buddha can love you and share, and then walk hand in hand. This is a buddha. So we have to behave as a buddha in the monastery as long as you are there. 

So, very naturally, the makings, your makings by birth, called buddha-nature, buddha. Great, great being beyond human speculation can manifest itself in your behavior, in your actions, in your everyday life. That is in monastic practice, everyday you do it. When you go to bathroom, gassho and bow, you sit. 

So, always you do it, and then naturally you can get the capacity which is very mature. So, mature capacity naturally can manifest itself in your everyday life. Naturally. 

In other words, if you practice tea ceremony, in the beginning you always try to manifest yourself according the rules and regulations. But if you continue to practice, naturally you don't pay attention to the rules. Rules makes you make something, even though you don't think. So, your capacity becomes mature. So, beyond the rules and regulations, naturally beautiful actions in tea ceremony manifest itself. 

So, if you continue to do it, very naturally, the dancing in action is perfectly beautiful. Perfectly beautiful. Beyond the like or dislike, it's beautiful. You don't know why. 

And then, this is the three points you can do. If you practice as a dancer like this, if you practice as a Zen student in a monastery like this, exactly, then you can see your life, how beautiful it is. 

Then, next, three points, ok? Three points must come together, and work together. 

At that time you must be always just like a bow and wind. Just stand up, and practice, and leave. Just like a wind: very breezy, just a breeze in summer. Feel cool, and then another breeze comes in. Ok? And then it leaves. Then another breeze comes. That is moment after moment you do. Ok? 

So, if you practice karate, judo, aikido, whatever, your body must be just like a bow and your action must be flexible. You have to move. 

So, your practice must, just like a, your practice is going like a wind, ok? And then, audience are fascinated by the realization of this subtle vision and performance. And then the audience and dancers come together and something happens between them, just like an electric, you know, what to say, spark? Just like an electric spark. That is spiritual communion, you say. *[He chuckles.]* Spiritual communion between dancer and audience, composers, past, present, future, all come together and working together. And then you are completely charmed by music, dance. Speechlessly. Nothing. 

That is called participating. Ok? Moving in the deep course of Prajnaparamita. 

In order to understand the world, human beings, you have to practice like this, constantly. If you don't understand first, why don't you share the love with the people, compassion with the people, anyway. Or, even though you cannot know how to share the compassion with the people, anyway let's walk hand in hand with the people, practically. Just do it, with whole sincere heart, with warm heart. Anyway, let's walk day by day with the people. And then, you can feel love, compassion. And then, you can understand the people. 

Then very naturally there is some communion. So that is spiritual, in Buddhism, in Japanese, we call it *kanno doko*, means spiritual communion between a person and buddha, person and the whole universe. In the intellectual sense, you don't understand this one. But practically, everyone experiences this one. Otherwise, your life is never supported by the universe, you never survive. 

Then if you take care of your life with sincere heart, naturally you can experience this one. Then, how can you describe it? I don't know. Then, moving in the deep course of Prajnaparamita is described as *empty*. That’s it. 

But, if you describe *empty*, do you say *nothing*? No. You never separate from Prajnaparamita. Perfect wisdom means you are never separate from all living beings, the whole universe. Even though you don't know, even though you hate it, even though you try to run away, you never separate from Prajnaparamita, the whole world, with love, with compassion, constantly. You never forget, you never leave compassion. 

So, that is this what this Prajnaparamita Sutra says. That's why it here it says that, “to the extent a Bodhisattva goes on contemplating all dharmas in this manner” – in this manner means participating in the deep course of perfect wisdom. Constantly make every possible effort to understand deeply into the world, day by day, instead of staying with a certain understanding of your own. Understanding, and move, go ahead. 

The other day someone asked me, if you keep going does it mean to escape from something? But I don't think so. For instance, if you see the anger, anger appears and the whole world angers. Whole world is occupied by anger. So you never escape from anger, the world of anger. So, you have to be there. But, the point is, *to keep going* means, “gone, gone beyond, gone altogether beyond” means right in the middle of, you know, anger, you shouldn’t stop living. You have to maintain the same pace as you have had. Constantly living, okay? Constantly going ahead. 

You know, I told you before probably, one of my friends one day made a *big* mistake, everyone knows. Everyone is critical toward him. He was a great teacher and great Zen priest, but he made a big mistake. But his personal life never changed. I was very impressed by him. But people around him were always critical and always put him down. Never respect. How can you live at that time? Can you live in peace and harmony? It's pretty hard. But he never changed. His attitude, his behaviors, he always kept going, in the confusion of suffering and pain and criticism, but he never changed. I was really impressed. 

So, keep going doesn’t mean escape, because you *never* escape. Whatever you experience, whatever you manifest yourself, I think you are always there. If you feel happy, you [and the] whole world becomes happy. So your life is right in the middle of the happy. But don't stay with it. If you stay with it, very naturally your life becomes limited by a certain idea of happiness you want to get. But happiness is completely freedom. Happiness is kind of great energy to support your life, to maintain your life, going ahead always. Enjoy, make your life joyful – this is happiness. If so, there is no reason you have to stay with the certain happiness you have had. Anyway, right in the middle of happiness, let's make your life fully alive. 

That is “gone, gone, gone beyond.” For what? For all living beings. Gone altogether beyond. 

At that time, it says, "What an awakening! All hail!" This is called enlightenment, awakening. This is awakening. If you awake, you really understand. If you wake up, you understand pretty well. If you understand, you cannot help being compassionate and being a friend to all living beings. Next, you really want to hold, embrace, in action. 

So that's why it says here, "Oh, what an awakening! All hail! This completes the Heart of Perfect Wisdom.” This is the essence of how to live in this world. 

But if you describe, it is meaningless. Because words don't hit the mark. 

What do you mean? What do you mean “the performance body must be like a wind?” What do you mean? I don't know. And also, why is the audience fascinated? By what? Beauty of the performance? Yes. What is the beauty of performance? We don't know. But audience is fascinated by the realization of his or her performance, including composers, past, present, future, audience, all circumstances. *How?* How do all come together, work together in his or her performance? We don't know. 

But there must be same and one ground where performance, audience, past, present, exist together there. That is called *emptiness*, we say. That is called emptiness, that is a place where all living beings are present there, and also working together, and also walking together. It's really wondrous. We don't know, but it's there. All are there. 

So, that's why emptiness is your experience, or emptiness is description of your practice. 

So if you want to experience the emptiness, you have to practice, participate in the deep cause of Prajnaparamita. This is called Avalokiteshvara. *Avalok* means to observe and to be observed. To observe the world and to be observed by world, to meanings there. Avalokiteshvara, Avalok. So Avalokiteshvara means “bodhisattva who listens to the cry after closely observing the world.” And then Avalokiteshvara can constantly listen to that cry, the sound – many sounds, many cries there. 

And then, the world needs Avalokiteshvara. Avalokiteshvara needs the world. I need you, you need me. So, awakening is all beings are interconnected, interpenetrated. This is the truth. 

So, don't see your object only by one way. In other words, don't stay with your own understanding. Because if you see the world, the world see you. So your understanding should be put aside for while, and then you should be a good listener to the world. If you want to be a good see-er, you have to be good listener to the world. And then, there is communication, communion between you and the whole world takes place. Otherwise, it's pretty difficult to practice together in peace and harmony. 

This is the meaning of Prajnaparamita here. 

So that's why I read this paragraph. “In that case, all the accumulation of the merit on the part of bodhisattva who causes imperfect wisdom must be described emptiness, just emptiness, worthless, insignificant, insubstantial. This is the basis of existence. It means you are free, completely free, liberated. 

“To the extent that the bodhisattva goes on contemplating all dharmas in this manner, to that extent he becomes one who does not lack imperfect wisdom.” So you can get the merit, if you practice, but that merit is described as emptiness, meaningless, worthless, unsubstantial. But that is accumulation of the merit, immeasurable merit there. So, what is the real merit? Real merit is to get the merit and then give it to all living beings. In other words, understand it, face the object, and taste it, experience it, then next, give away your experience to emptiness, to the whole world. 

In other words, be a good listener. “You must be a good seer” means you have to see the object, you have to get in touch with the object constantly. At that time you can be a good seer. Next, you must be a good listener, that means you put aside your understanding, your experience. And then if you become a good listener, you can deepen your experience constantly, you can deepen your understanding constantly. This is not an idea, this is not a philosophical teaching, this is a *practice* you have to do every day. Day by day, you have to do. 

You know, they always happen in such a good situation, no problem, but in unfavorable conditions, everyone is pretty easy to despair and disappointed, and then the whole world is separate from you, you can't believe in that way. It's very difficult to move ahead. So at that time you should remember this sutra, the teaching of the sutras: move ahead, keep going, constantly keep going. It's very hard, but by hard experience, your ego-centered ideas are dropped away, by stumbling, called *pain*. That is a unique way to be free from self-centeredness. Otherwise, there is no other way to be free from self-centeredness, egoistic. Human beings are very egoistic. How do you be free from ego? It's pretty hard. That's why people want to practice alone, be alone, be present alone – don't touch me, okay? *[He chuckles.]* Always you say don't touch, and then if you practice together, it's really painful, much, much, much painful. That's why people don't want to do. But this is important. That pain makes you practice exactly egolessness. 

So again and again, you have to practice together like this. If you practice alone, it seems to be wonderful, but I don't know if it is good or bad. So that's why this is important, why “we have to practice together” means not only for you, for all living beings. In order to build up peaceful world, peaceful living – that's why you have to do it. You have to live together, you have to practice together. Whatever kind of pain you experience, this is a very unique way to be free from ego.
