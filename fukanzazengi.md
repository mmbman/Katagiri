##### [*Fukanzazengi*: Dōgen's Universal Recommendation for Zazen – Talk 1](1979-06-09-Fukanzazengi-Talk-1)
###### June 9, 1979 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi

Katagiri Roshi begins a series of talks on *Fukanzazengi*, Zen Master Dōgen’s universal recommendation for practicing zazen (seated meditation), by examining the meaning of the line, “For you must know that just there, in zazen, the right dharma is manifesting itself, and that from the first, dullness and distraction are struck aside.” He introduces a six-component system for understanding zazen, and also the three core points of *samadhi*, *egolessness*, and *no design on becoming Buddha*. Another important point is *faith* or *belief*, which is understood somewhat differently from how Westerners often hear those words. By arranging circumstances and practicing these points, we can sit down in the core of our *total personality*, which is *buddha-nature*.

###### June 10, 1979 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi

Katagiri Roshi reviews the six-component system for understanding zazen that he introduced in the previous talk, and further discusses the relationship between regulation of body and mind, *samadhi* (one-pointedness), *egolessness*, *shikantaza* (wholehearted sitting), and *total personality*. The distinction between “religious zazen” and philosophical or psychological zazen is explored. There is an extended question and answer period.

###### June 11, 1979 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi

Katagiri Roshi examines the meaning of the line “from the first, dullness and distraction are struck aside” from another angle, discussing Hashimoto Roshi’s statement that “if you sit down even for a moment, you become Buddha.” He talks about three different kinds of zazen (sitting meditation), and why *shikantaza* is not a means to an end. He also explains what it means to accumulate merit and virtue, how to understand and work with past karma, and why we have to aim at the life after next life. There is a story about a commando who visited the Zen Center. Also: what to do when death taps your back.

##### [*Fukanzazengi*: Dōgen's Universal Recommendation for Zazen – Talk 4](1979-06-12-Fukanzazengi-Talk-4)
###### June 12, 1979 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi

Katagiri Roshi discusses the meaning of the line, “In surveying the past, we find that transcendence of both un-enlightenment and enlightenment, and dying while either sitting or standing, have all depended entirely on the strength of zazen,” using the example of *Blue Cliff Record* Case 46, “Ching Ch’ing’s Sound of Raindrops.” He talks about life and death, and how to “cease fire” in zazen. There is a story about a machine that reads brain waves, and he discusses whether there are any real Zen teachers in the United States.

##### [*Fukanzazengi*: Dōgen's Universal Recommendation for Zazen – Talk 5](1979-06-13-Fukanzazengi-Talk-5)
###### June 13, 1979 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi

Katagiri Roshi talks about the difference between zazen itself and seeing zazen *before zazen* or *after zazen*, using the example of Gensha Shibi in “One Bright Pearl.” In an extended question and answer period, he explains the difference between physical and psychological exhaustion, how to work with the “vomit” of the mind, and why we should do zazen for future generations. Does the world disappear during zazen? Are there techniques in Zen? And is Zen the simplest, most “pure” way?

##### [*Fukanzazengi*: Dōgen's Universal Recommendation for Zazen – Talk 6](1979-06-14-Fukanzazengi-Talk-6)
###### June 14, 1979 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi

Katagiri Roshi explains “body and mind dropping off” from the standpoint of Buddhist psychology. This talk focuses on *samskaras*, which is often translated as “impulses” or “formations,” but here is discussed as the “together-maker.” In relation to this, Katagiri Roshi explains a key line from Dōgen’s *Genjokoan*: “Oneness is not like moon reflected in the water; when one is bright, the other one is dark.” He also discusses the lines from *Fukanzazengi*, “It cannot be fully known by the practicing or realizing of supernatural power either. It must be deportment beyond one’s hearing and seeing. Is it not the principle that is prior to knowledge and perceptions?” During a discussion of the “forces” of *prāpti* and *aprāpti*, he tells a story about the 1948 Fukui earthquake in Japan.

##### [*Fukanzazengi*: Dōgen's Universal Recommendation for Zazen – Talk 7](1979-06-15-Fukanzazengi-Talk-7)
###### June 15, 1979 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi

The conclusion to this series of talks on *Fukanzazengi* takes place during a thunderstorm, the sounds of which Katagiri Roshi integrates into the talk. The Buddha does zazen during a thunderstorm, but he is not disturbed by the sound of the thunder. Katagiri Roshi discusses why the purpose of zazen is not to reach a state of no consciousness, and the meaning of the term *jijuyu* (usually translated as “self-fulfillment”) in *Bendōwa*. Also: How to play guitar with two hands and two feet. A Rinzai Zen Master plays a Bach concerto in the zendo. And what does Manjushri do, anyway?
