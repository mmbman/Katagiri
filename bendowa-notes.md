> SZ: Talk on Pursuing the Way

- “The Way” is *tao* or *dao* (道), or in Japanese, *dō*. Dōgen Zenji’s name, *Dō*-*gen* (道元), means “Way Origin.”
- The term “Way” is discussed extensively by Katagiri Roshi; perhaps the best place to start is the [“Principles of Practice”](principles-of-practice) series.
- For more on the term “Way” see [“Notes on Fukanzazengi”](fukanzazengi-notes)

> 諸佛來、ともに妙法を單して、阿菩提をするに、最上無爲の妙術あり。 これ、ただほとけ、佛にさづけてよこしまなることなきは、すなはち自受用三昧、その標準なり。
> 
> SZ: The buddhas, the tathagatas, all have a wondrous skill, supreme and unconditioned, for uniquely transmitting the wondrous dharma and verifying *anuttara-bodhi*. The reason this [method] is transmitted only from buddha to buddha, without deviation, is that the *samādhi* of receiving and using the self is its standard. 
> 
> EB: Buddha-tathagatas all have a wonderful means, which is unexcelled and free from human agency, for transmitting the wondrous Dharma from one to another
without alteration and realizing supreme and complete awakening. That it is only transmitted without deviation from buddha to buddha is due to the *jijuyu* samadhi, which is its touchstone.
>
> MD: All buddha tathagatas, who directly transmit inconceivable dharma and actualize supreme, perfect enlightenment, have a wondrous way, unsurpassed and unconditioned. Only buddhas transmit it to buddhas without veering off; self-fulfilling samadhi is its standard. 

- Katagiri Roshi reviews these lines in [“*Bendōwa*: Dōgen’s Questions & Answers – Talk 3” at 33:16](1987-03-13-Bendowa-Talk-3#3316), introducing them as Dōgen Zenji’s statement of “the key point of the zazen we are practicing.” 
- *Jijuyu zanmai* (自受用三味) – *jijuyu* samadhi, “the *samādhi* of receiving and using the self” or “self-fulfilling samadhi” – is discussed particularly at:
    - [“*Bendōwa*: Dōgen’s Questions & Answers – Talk 1” at 48:44](1987-03-11-Bendowa-Talk-1#4844) - as “wow” or “self-joyfulness” 
    - [“*Bendōwa*: Dōgen’s Questions & Answers – Talk 3” at 33:16](1987-03-13-Bendowa-Talk-3#3316) - referring specifically to these first lines.
    - [“*Bendōwa*: Dōgen’s Questions & Answers – Talk 3” at 1:01:51](1987-03-13-Bendowa-Talk-3#10151) - specific question on why “self-enjoyment samadhi, noting that the translation is difficult and it’s not exactly “joy”.
    - [“*Bendōwa*: Dōgen’s Questions & Answers – Talk 5” at 24:10](1987-03-15-Bendowa-Talk-5#2410) - as being the same as *sho* or “realization,” or *buddha*. 
    - [“*Fukanzazengi*: Dōgen’s Universal Recommendation for Zazen – Talk 7” at 9:14](1979-06-15-Fukanzazengi-Talk-7#914) - here he translates *ji* as “of itself” rather than “self”. 
    - [“Taking Care of Karma” at 1:00:05](1980-07-04-Karma-Taking-Care-of-Karma#10005) - the connection with karma is noted.
    - [“*The Awakening of Faith* – Talk 37” at 22:20](1986-04-18-Awakening-of-Faith-Talk-37#2220) - with regard to ceremonies, particularly funeral services.
    - [“Turning the Three Poisons into Wheels” at 15:46](1986-06-28-Turning-the-Three-Poisons-into-Wheels#1546) - with regard to the precepts and the three poisons.
    - [“Zazen: Entry to the Buddha Dharma”](1987-03-07-Zazen-Entry-to-the-Buddha-Dharma) – as “wow!” or “ah”. 
    - [“Platform Sutra – Talk 7”](1987-04-24-Platform-Sutra-Talk-7) – on not understanding it.
    - [“*Baika*: Plum Blossoms – Talk 2” at 58:54](1988-12-03-Baika-Talk-2#5854) – on the connecting with (or equivalence to) *ki* or “momentum of time and energy.”
    - [“*Baika*: Plum Blossoms – Talk 5”](1988-12-06-Baika-Talk-5) - TBD.
