> SZ: Talk on Pursuing the Way

- “The Way” is *tao* or *dao* (道), or in Japanese, *dō*. Dōgen Zenji’s name, *Dō*-*gen* (道元), means “Way Origin.”
- The term “Way” is discussed extensively by Katagiri Roshi; perhaps the best place to start is the [“Principles of Practice”](principles-of-practice) series.
- For more on the term “Way” see [“Notes on Fukanzazengi”](fukanzazengi-notes)

> 諸佛如來、ともに妙法を單傅して、阿耨菩提を證するに、最上無爲の妙術あり。 
> 
> SZ: The buddhas, the tathagatas, all have a wondrous skill, supreme and unconditioned, for uniquely transmitting the wondrous dharma and verifying *anuttara-bodhi*. 
> 
> EB: Buddha-tathagatas all have a wonderful means, which is unexcelled and free from human agency, for transmitting the wondrous Dharma from one to another
without alteration and realizing supreme and complete awakening. 
>
> MD: All buddha tathagatas, who directly transmit inconceivable dharma and actualize supreme, perfect enlightenment, have a wondrous way, unsurpassed and unconditioned. 

- Katagiri Roshi reviews the first two lines in [“*Bendōwa*: Dōgen’s Questions & Answers – Talk 3” at 33:16](1987-03-13-Bendowa-Talk-3#3316), introducing them as Dōgen Zenji’s statement of “the key point of the zazen we are practicing.” 

-  In Chinese, *wu wei* (無爲) – translated here as “unconditioned” or “free from human agency” – is a philosophical term literally meaning “not-acting” or “not-doing,” according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei). In Japanese, apparantly the term is *mui*; it translates the Sanskrit term *asamskrita*, and has the same meaning as “unconstructed”. (*Moon in a Dewdrop*, glossary, p. 346.)

- *Shō* (證), translated here as “verifying” or “realizing”, is a key term that should not be overlooked. Katagiri Roshi spends an entire talk discussing it in [“*Bendōwa*: Dōgen’s Questions & Answers – Talk 5”](1987-03-15-Bendowa-Talk-5). For more references to *shō* see [“Notes on Fukanzazengi”](fukanzazengi-notes).

- *Anuttara-bodhi* (阿耨菩提) is short for the Sanskrit *anuttara-samyak-sambodhi*: “complete, perfect, supreme enlightenment.” Katagiri Roshi discusses this term specifically at: 
	- [“Principles of Practice, Talk 1: The Purpose of Practice”](1986-03-19-Principles-of-Practice-Talk-1) - as the “purpose of spiritual life,” in relation to *prajñāpāramitā*.
	- [“Principles of Practice, Talk 2: Bodhicitta”](1986-03-20-Principles-of-Practice-Talk-2) - as *bodhicitta* or bodhi-mind, or “one-mind of the Buddha.”
	- [“Three Collective Pure Precepts” at 15:02](1986-04-26-Three-Collective-Pure-Precepts#1502) - connection to the Three Collective Pure Precepts.
	- [“Diamond Sutra, Talk 9: Emptiness” at 11:27](1979-08-01-Diamond-Sutra-Emptiness#1127) – as identical with *sho*, “realization”.

> これ、ただほとけ、佛にさづけてよこしまなることなきは、すなはち自受用三昧、その標準なり。
> 
> SZ: The reason this [method] is transmitted only from buddha to buddha, without deviation, is that the *samādhi* of receiving and using the self is its standard. 
> 
> EB: That it is only transmitted without deviation from buddha to buddha is due to the *jijuyu* samadhi, which is its touchstone.
>
> MD: Only buddhas transmit it to buddhas without veering off; self-fulfilling samadhi is its standard. 

- *Jijuyu zanmai* (自受用三昧) – *jijuyu* samadhi, “the *samādhi* of receiving and using the self” or “self-fulfilling samadhi” – is discussed particularly at:
    - [“*Bendōwa*: Dōgen’s Questions & Answers – Talk 1” at 48:44](1987-03-11-Bendowa-Talk-1#4844) - as “wow” or “self-joyfulness.” 
    - [“*Bendōwa*: Dōgen’s Questions & Answers – Talk 3” at 33:16](1987-03-13-Bendowa-Talk-3#3316) - referring specifically to these first lines.
    - [“*Bendōwa*: Dōgen’s Questions & Answers – Talk 3” at 1:01:51](1987-03-13-Bendowa-Talk-3#10151) - specific question on why it’s referred to as “self-enjoyment samadhi,” noting that the translation is difficult and it’s not exactly “joy.”
    - [“*Bendōwa*: Dōgen’s Questions & Answers – Talk 5” at 24:10](1987-03-15-Bendowa-Talk-5#2410) - as being the same as *sho* or “realization.” Or earlier, noting that it is the same as *buddha*. 
    - [“*Fukanzazengi*: Dōgen’s Universal Recommendation for Zazen – Talk 7” at 9:14](1979-06-15-Fukanzazengi-Talk-7#914) - here KR translates *ji* as “of itself” rather than “self.” 
    - [“Taking Care of Karma” at 1:00:05](1980-07-04-Karma-Taking-Care-of-Karma#10005) - the connection with karma is noted.
    - [“*The Awakening of Faith* – Talk 37” at 22:20](1986-04-18-Awakening-of-Faith-Talk-37#2220) - with regard to ceremonies, particularly funeral services.
    - [“Turning the Three Poisons into Wheels” at 15:46](1986-06-28-Turning-the-Three-Poisons-into-Wheels#1546) - with regard to the precepts and the three poisons.
    - [“Zazen: Entry to the Buddha Dharma”](1987-03-07-Zazen-Entry-to-the-Buddha-Dharma) – as “wow!” or “ahhh.” 
    - [“Platform Sutra – Talk 7”](1987-04-24-Platform-Sutra-Talk-7) – on not understanding it.
    - [“*Baika*: Plum Blossoms – Talk 2” at 58:54](1988-12-03-Baika-Talk-2#5854) – on the connecting with (or equivalence to) *ki* or “momentum of time and energy.”
    - [“*Baika*: Plum Blossoms – Talk 5”](1988-12-06-Baika-Talk-5) - TBD.

> この三昧に遊化するに、端坐参禪を正門とせり。
> 
> SZ: To disport oneself in this samadhi, studying Zen in upright sitting, is considered the main gateway.
> 
> EB: To disport oneself freely in this samadhi, the right entrance is proper sitting in zazen.
> 
> MD: Sitting upright, practicing Zen, is the authentic gate to the unconfined realm of this samadhi.

-  *Yuge* (遊戯) is from Sanskrit *vikrīḍita* (विक्रीडित) – “play” or “sport”. Apparantly this appears as *yuke* (遊化) in a version of Bendōwa (EB, p. 129).

- *Upright sitting* (端坐): for the character *za* 坐, “sitting”, see [“Katagiri Roshi’s Zazen Instruction”](zazen-instruction).

- “Practicing zen” or “studying zen” is *sanzen* (參禪), another key term. Katagiri Roshi often leaves the term *sanzen* untranslated because the word *practice* in English “doesn’t hit the mark” of what *sanzen* means. He comments on the actual meaning of *sanzen* extensively; see:
   - [“Zazen: Dropping Off Body and Mind”](1987-01-24-Zazen-Dropping-Off-Body-and-Mind) - *sanzen* as “surrender to tranquility or simplicity (zen) in life.” 
       - The question, then, is what we mean by “tranquility”. One talk where *tranquility* is discussed in greater detail (pun more or less intended) is [“Principles of Practice, Talk 1: The Purpose of Practice”](1986-03-19-Principles-of-Practice-Talk-1), where the Japanese term *jakujō* is discussed.
   - [“Zazen: Entry to the Buddha Dharma” at 18:32](1987-03-07-Zazen-Entry-to-the-Buddha-Dharma#1832) 
   - [“Principles of Practice, Talk 1: The Purpose of Practice”](1986-03-19-Principles-of-Practice-Talk-1)
   - [“Principles of Practice, Talk 2: Bodhicitta”](1986-03-20-Principles-of-Practice-Talk-2)
   - See also [“Notes on Fukanzazengi”](fukanzazengi-notes)

- The term *shōmon* 正門 – translated as “main gateway”, “authentic gate”, or “right entrance” – appears later in Questions 1 and 2, and so – happily – the term is covered extensively by Katagiri Roshi, who uses the term *right entrance*: 
    - [“Zazen: Entry to the Buddha Dharma”](1987-03-07-Zazen-Entry-to-the-Buddha-Dharma) In his extensive commentary, Katagiri Roshi says, “*Right* means that you have to learn (or do) something straightforward[ly], without artifice or design, without intention or purposes.”
