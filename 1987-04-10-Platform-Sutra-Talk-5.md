> “Good Knowing Advisors, my Dharma-door produces 84,000 wisdoms from the one Prajna. Why? Because worldly people have 84,000 kinds of defilement...

> (From *The Sixth Patriarch’s Dharma Jewel Platform Sutra*, published and translated by the Buddhist Text Translation Society.)

The dharma doors produces 84,000 wisdoms form the one Prajna. 

I think, from the one Prajna. Dharma-door is the truth, the universe, produces 84,000 wisdoms from the one Prajna, one perfect wisdom. So one perfect wisdom is, the true wisdom is one truth. So, one truth. 

84,000 wisdoms. That is not only 84,000, [but] myriad, myriad wisdoms. Wisdoms of trees, plants, walls, fences. Myriad, myriad beings. As long there are myriad, myriad beings, there are myriad wisdoms. 

And then from those wisdoms are one truth, one wisdom. That’s here it says.
