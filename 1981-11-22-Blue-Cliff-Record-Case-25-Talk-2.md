[The pointer to the case:]

> If your potential does not leave (its fixed) position, you tumble down into the poison sea. If your words don’t startle the crowd, you fall into the streams of the commonplace.
> Suddenly, if you can distinguish initiate from lay in the light of sparks struck from stone, if you can decide between killing and giving life in the light of a flash of lightning, then you can cut off the ten directions and tower up like a thousand fathom wall.
> But do you know that such a time exists? To test I’m citing this old case: look!

> If your potential does not leave (its fixed) position, you tumble down into the poison sea.

Your potential means possibility. Possibility means that our nature is just like a vast expanse of ocean, from which the water comes up constantly. So potential is not something you don’t know, because it’s coming up. But you cannot grasp exactly what is the potentiality. A potentiality or possibility is something which you can verify right in the middle of the full aliveness of your life. Day by day. So at that time, potentiality or possibility coming up. So possibility appears and disappears. Many things appear and disappear, appear and disappear. That is possibility. And ... things coming: your capability, your knowledge, whatever it is, coming up. That is our original nature. So it is not a matter of philosophical discussion, philosophical world. Nothing but just function, process. So we say working, or function, according to my term it is *full aliveness*. So your potential means your full aliveness of your life doesn’t leave its fixed position. The full aliveness of your life actually doesn’t stay, doesn’t consent to stay with full aliveness, because full aliveness is constantly full aliveness. So if you fixed your life, immediately you stumble down into the poison sea, because your original nature is constant full aliveness, so-call potentiality, or so-called possibility, eternal possibility. Whoever you are. So constantly I always say lets give away your life to eternal possibility, constantly. That is just like pouring the water into an empty water pump. And then you move the handle of the water pump, and grab any water that comes out. So anyway all your life the bitterness and sadness and pleasures, all things, anyway, return to eternity, eternal possibility, just like pouring empty pump. And then it means work, it means nothing but functioning and full aliveness. It’s not a matter of philosophical world you can discuss. So day by day, you have to work. So very naturally water comes up. 

But if you don’t do this, it’s pretty hard to live in this world. If you look at existing religions, not only Christianity, even Buddhism, I always feel that existing religion always molds human life into certain patterns. “You should believe this” and then religion comes into existence. You believe this first. Of course belief is important for us, but what is belief? So always something give, and then your life has to be molded into this candle mold, and then you are a “good boy”. I don’t think so. You are not a good boy, you are a dry fish. *[Laughter.]* You are exactly dead, but you don’t know, you don’t realize. And then if you are happy, if you become a dry fish, you become a very obedient person. “Do this.” “Yes, sir!” “Do that.” “Yes, sir!” Very obedient. But in a sense, your intellectual, rational and theoretical knowledge doesn’t work. In many ways, existing religion always in many ways tries to mold your life into a certain pattern, narrowly believing in divinities. 

Look at Zen in the United States. Zen is always giving some koans, and then, “pass”. This is also you are already patterned. You are already formed into certain patterns. And then if you pass this koan, “next”. So again and again, religion giving something and molding your life into a certain pattern. At that time you are not dry fish, you are *smoked* dry fish. *[Laughter.]* We’re not satisfied with dry fish, so we try to smoke the dry fish. That’s interesting, isn’t it? That is existing religion, we do always. 

So dry fish of course it’s pretty tasty, but remember it is not real fish! It’s not alive. It’s dead. *[He laughs.]* You cannot get dead fish, because you are alive. But if you think you’re alive, ... 

*[tape problem]*

... cannot. That’s why you’re completely confused. And also if you become confused you try to give some way of mentioning to you and molding your life into a certain pattern, so-called many disciplines, and put your life into something, and then you become smoked fish. It’s tasty. Smoked fish is more tasty than dry fish. But still it is not real fish. Real fish is really alive. Remember this!

So that’s why you tumble down into the poison sea. Poison sea means the smoked fish. You become smoked dry fish. At that time it doesn’t work. It’s pretty hard to live right in the middle of human suffering, but remember, in suffering is already great proof you are alive. So we have to handle in many ways, day by day. And also, a point is the people around you are also important. The people around you are very critical, and people around you are dry fish or smoked dry fish, it’s very hard to live, don’t you think so? Like most of human society, if you go to work and people around you seem to be alive but not really alive, almost have dry fish, same smoked dry fish. It’s pretty hard, that’s why you feel hard. That’s why each of us be present around a certain person not as dry fish, as vivid real fish. At that time you can really help, whatever happens. That is very important. 

So that’s why here it says, “If your potential doesn’t leave it’s fixed position, you tumble down into the poison sea.”

##### 11:27

When you’re a child, it’s very easy to educate, “You should do this one,” “You should believe this one.” A, B, C, D, E. But when you grow into an adult, it’s pretty hard to escape from such education. It’s very hard because already such a way of life is rooted in the bottom of your life. So it’s very hard to be free from. To be free from means to be face to face with your life, real life. Regardless of whether you believe in something or not, directly we have to see what is real life. That is pretty hard, pretty hard.

Probably you may still have doubts. If it is true, why does Katagiri give [instruction] for zazen, shikantaza, “do it”, this is also you have doubt. Katagiri molds the students life into a certain pattern, so-called shikantaza. I don’t think so. Don’t misunderstand this. *[Laughter.]* 

Dogen Zenji says ... I don’t remember exactly, but he says, if you want to practice the Buddha Way, you should believe first. What should you believe? You should believe that life is completely in no confusion, no delusion, no perverted ideas. That means what? Nothing to grasp, so-called “I want to believe.” Nothing. So you should believe that you are in no confusion, no delusion, no perverted views, no mistaken understanding. What do you mean? Can you call “this is God?” It is not a certain idea. Anyway you should believe that you are in ... etc.  That means nothing. But believing in nothing means it’s not ... philosophical world, it is something *you* have to do. That is a practice. That’s all. 

That’s why shikantaza is.. What is shikantaza? I don’t want to mold your life into a certain pattern, so-called zazen, shikantaza. If you believe this, shikantaza becomes sort of, not a dry fish, but a gold dry fish. Putting gold around the dry fish, and the light comes up from the gold dry fish, and then you really believe, “Wonderful, wonderful.” So the dry fish becomes gold. But I don’t think this is Zen. If you believe zazen, shikantaza like this, it’s the same thing, looking at the wonderful angels coming down from heaven, “Please help,” you know? Something like this, exactly the same. But I don’t think so. 

Anyway, to do zazen is *you* have to do zazen. To do zazen means to believe in that you are in no confusion or delusion, no mistaken understanding. That is not the model of philosophical discussion. It is just be there, right in the middle of zazen. What is no delusion, no confusion, no mistaken understanding. Well *you* must be no mistaken understanding, right in the middle of zazen. What is that? Just zazen becoming one, as one, as with the zazen. So no confusion. No delusions. No mistaken understanding. But mind is always going fast, you know? Just like Spider Man or Super Man, you know: *pew*, that’s it. And catches something. And then bring it back, and then you say, “Oh, there is a mistake.” That is really the human mind, consciously, just like computers. Your brain is really a computer, a fascinating computer. It’s wonderful... but it’s trouble for us. It’s great, but... So anyway, if you do zazen but you don’t accept zazen *exactly as it is*, the zazen you accept is zazen you have “decoded.” You have *decoded* it, do you understand? You have *translated* it. So I say “Shikantaza; just sit down there.” “Yes, sir.” And then immediately, you translate it. By what? By your consciousness, you immediately translate it. So it’s pretty hard for us to accept zazen as it is, without decoding the zazen, or other’s words, language, whatever it is.

##### 17:41

I told you before, a woman had a facelift operation. And people praised her, one hundred percent perfect operation. People said, “Wonderful! You have one hundred percent successful face operation!” And then she didn’t feel good, because she accepted that wonderful praise, words, not strictly as it is. She decoded it as meaning she used to look ugly. So immediately she “decoded,” do you understand? [If you say,] “Katagiri is a wonderful teacher,” actually all I have to do is accept, but immediately I cannot accept “Katagiri, wonderful, thanks,” still I decode. Is it alright? *[He laughs.]* How about your past life? Why don’t you look at the past life? Always we do that. Of course we should accept the past and present and future. But anyway, we are going to the future, no going backward. 

Buddha is compassionate to all sentient beings, even though a person who kills nine hundred and ninety-nine people, in order to make rings of human fingers. You know that story? And then he became a monk anyway by Buddha Shakyamuni’s guidance, one day. And then he practiced begging the street; at that time people asked him to perform a Buddhist ceremony for delivering a child in safety. In India they have a custom, if you can get a priest to chant for the pregnant lady, at that time she can give birth to her baby in safety. So they asked this monk to chant, but he immediately accepted that request with decoding people, because he had killed lots of people. So he want back to Shakyamuni Buddha and asked, “What should I do?” Buddha said, “Tell her, ‘I do anything to kill anyone.’” So, just perform. That’s really *great compassion*. 

Immediately we decode. If you decode your life and decode others’ message or whatever, it’s pretty hard to make your life alive. So we have to practice like this constantly, without decoding, we have to do, day by day, we have to live with all sentient beings. To live just in your territory, it’s pretty easy to live vividly, but to live with people vividly is not so easy. 

That’s why here is says, “If your potential does not leave (its fixed) position, you tumble down into the poison sea.”

#### 22:14

> If your words don’t startle the crowd, you fall into the streams of the commonplace.

Words coming from that full aliveness. When your life is fully alive, day by day, even though holding the suffering, the pain, endlessly alive. And hoping... anyway, day by day. At that time, words coming up from very deep silence. So people are really educated by those words. 

I told you before, words should come not from your head, but from silence. Silence means the silent world behind you. Because the world we can see, the world of your life, I can see your world, but that is just a front. But behind your life, lots of stories, long stories, which are silent, very silent. It’s pretty hard to say. But this huge vastness of the world behind your life really works. At that time, word coming up, not only front, but that from the silence comes up. That word is not the word, so you shouldn’t understand just the word. So behind the word, there is a huge world. That’s why the word is important for us. 

Bodhidharma says, “Vastness and nothing holy.” That is a simple term. When Emperor Wu asks, “What is the essence of Buddhism?” Bodhidharma says, “Vastness and nothing holy.” Actually we don’t understand, but it is very sharp, very great, wonderful words coming from bodhisattvas, Bodhidharma, silent world. That’s why still from generation to generation, even though we don’t understand, still we have to think of it. Or we are captured by thinking of it. So that is important for us. 

So how can I get that word? There is no particular pattern. All we have to do is just practice day by day, basically. That is really planting a good seed day by day. And then the planting seed is what? Can you get some reward from planting the seed? Nothing. But planting seed is planting seed. But actually you cannot get the reward from, because day by day it is changing, so next moment, we don’t know. That seed grows or fruit? We don’t know. But planting seed is planting seed. And then next moment, it becomes silent. 

So this silence really affecting your life. But usually we plant the seed and then expect something. And then we want to let the seed grow completely. If it doesn’t grow, you’re really disappointed. Of course we should take of the seed you have planted. But we don’t know, actually. Nevertheless we don’t know what will happen. So we have to accept the seed which you have planted silently, totally accept. And silently we have to take care of the seed which you have planted. That is important. And then very naturally, your life is deepened. 

So “If your words don’t startle the crowd, you fall into the streams of the commonplace”. Commonplace means the very usual world. The word becomes very usual. Other people use. 

##### 27:16

Language is very interesting. 

I went to Omaha one day, and went to have lunch with people at Japanese restaurant named Genji. And a young lady was there, and really was very surprised to see me, because she had never seen a Buddhist priest in the United States since she came. So she was very surprised, and glanced at me. Are you a ... a priest? Yes I am. She said, you’re a priest. She was very happy to see me. And then she said, what kind of Buddhist school did you belong to? I said Zen Buddhism. “Well what do you do?” I said, “I do zazen.” *[Laughter.]* She knows the term zazen, so she said, “Oh, that’s terrible.” *[Laughter.]* “If I do zazen it’s painful, isn’t it?” I said, “Oh yes, it’s painful. But wherever you go, you can feel painful.” She was very surprised! *[He laughs.]* She was very surprised, and she couldn’t forget these words. Finally she came again later and just sat zazen with us. She was very impressed: “Wherever you may go, you feel painful.” Like sleeping in bed for all day and keeping the same posture – you feel painful. Without doing anything, just sleep. It’s very painful in many ways, wherever you may go. Pain is pain.

It’s very interesting, just a simple, usual word, but it depends on the speaker and listeners. How can the listener accept this word. If the listener is ready to digest a certain word deeply, it’s wonderful. But if you are not, if you as a listener are not ready to digest a simple word, well, just the usual common word, don’t you think so? So you must be ready to talk, and also you have to get people who are ready to accept your words. That is also a very interesting point. So we don’t know what is sharp, helpful, suggestive words. Any kinds of words become suggestive and instructive, very good words. It depends on you, and it depends on the listener. That’s why Buddha always uses the words according to individual personality and circumstances, et cetera. 

> Suddenly, if you can distinguish initiate from lay in the light of sparks struck from stone, 

That is just like according to being compounded with time, and also meeting with circumstances. You have to do something, you have to speak something. But it is not something you can do after your thinking or by your technique. No. It’s just coming up. So that’s why here it says “in the light of sparks struck from stone.” Zen, particularly the Blue Cliff Record, pretty often uses these kind of “light of sparks struck from the stone,” or “the flash of lightning” like this. Then you believe enlightenment is just like this. You should get enlightened, otherwise you are not a Zen student.  But I don’t think so. Don’t misunderstand. This is just a word. But flashing lightning comes up in many ways; you don’t realize it sometimes. It comes up very naturally. Sometimes you can realize it, but it’s very rare. If you realize just like a flash of light, it;s very rare. That is what is called satori. Satori: poof ...  But don’t expect satori always. If you cannot, forget it, never mind. Still you can live in the light of flashing lightning. Because you are in the middle of the truth. 

I told you, the truth is characterized by rebounding your life, constantly rebounding. Rebounding means if you touch it you cannot stay with it, and then immediately you have to rebound your life. That means shock, spiritual shock. If you really try to, you can have a shock. But if you don’t [have one], you don’t. But actually we are always touching, but our mind is very dumb, so we touch it but we don’t know. Always touching, rebounding our life... and how dumb our mind is, that’s why don’t [know]. Then practicing constantly, and someday you really catch it: *boom*. And then that is called *satori*, maybe. *[He laughs.]* But it’s very rare, very rare. But you believe satori is a sort of [sneaky], coming into your life. *[Laughter.]* And then when you realize “Oh – already I am!” But this is also satori, okay? Don’t worry. Never mind. *[Laughter.]*

##### 35:16

> if you can decide between killing and giving life in the light of a flash of lightning, then you can cut off the ten directions and tower up like a thousand fathom wall.

If you can decide between killing and giving life in the light of a flash of lightning, then you think just like a Nansen killing a cat: “Say something and then you don’t say, I will kill a cat.” Just like this – I don’t think so. It’s not Zen. It is a part of Zen, but it is very dramatic Zen. It’s not common. Don’t imitate it. 

In the Blue Cliff Record, there is another same sort of book, Shōyōroku, Book of Equanimity, this is very different from this Blue Cliff Record. If you read the Blue Cliff Record, always there is a fantastic enlightenment “show” in front of you. And then from the enlightenment, always words come up just like a flashlight. How is this? How do you like this? Always very fantastic and very sharp and dynamic energy here. But Book of Equanimity is very quiet. It’s very interesting. Using the same koan and same explanation, but a different feeling. 

So one Japanese Zen Master didn’t use the Blue Cliff Record, always using the other one, Shōyōroku. *[He laughs.]* Very interesting. I understand that one. But we should know this aspect of Zen teaching. But don’t imitate it. Zen must be something coming up from your heart. Digest Buddha’s teaching in your life. 

So, “you can decide between killing and giving life in the light of a flash of lightning,” that means you must be constantly alive, instead of being stuck in a certain pattern of your life which you have experienced, good or evil, whatever. You must be constantly alive. At that time you can really decide between killing and giving life in the light of a flash of lightning.

“Then you can cut off the ten directions and tower up like a thousand fathom wall.” You can really see the vastness of the human world without ... that means full aliveness, not dry fish. 

##### 

I told you yesterday, “I am thinking therefor I exist” Descartes said, one of the famous philosophers... 

*[Tape change.]*

And also Dogen Zenji says to learn Buddhism is to learn the self. And also Buddha says the self is something you can depend on. You can make yourself a light, you can make a self a light. So *self* is a light for you, a place for you to depend on.

I understand “I am thinking therefore I exist,” but this self is not the individual self. Dogen Zenji says “to learn Buddhism is to learn the self” is not the individual self. Universal self. Universal self means completely beyond “should I live or should I die.” There is nothing to discuss about this. Why do you live? What is the purpose of living? Maybe you have questions, why do we do zazen? To do zazen is really a question of to live. That is zazen. But anyway so if you want to know the reason why you have to zazen, it means you have to know the reason why you live. This is very basic. 

The reason why you live means not the model of discussing I should live or I should die. No. No preconditions, no sense of preconditions, no sense of presuppositions. A presupposition itself has a question, why? The reason why we have to live is pointing out to presupposition itself, before you think “I should live” or “I shouldn’t live,” or “I should die.” Completely beyond this. 

Because this is the original nature of the self. For instance, when you get cancer, or when you are about to die, this is a very good example, that’s why I told you. When you get cancer or become sick, can’t you die is a sickness, do you believe sickness in reality is something you can discuss? Should I escape or should I say, or should I live or should I die? No way. No matter how long you discuss this, sickness is going anyway. *Who* is sick? *You* are sick – not some other people, you are sick. At that time, do you discuss in your head, “I don’t like sickness” or “I love sickness.” Well it’s ridiculous. Even though you say so, if you like sickness, can you stay with sickness forever? No. You don’t like sickness? No I don’t like. Should you escape from this? Yes I want to. Well that is nothing but thinking with your head. Sickness is here. Who accepts this sickness? You accept it. This you is completely beyond discussion. That is what is called the self in absolute reality. So you have to learn the absolute self, beyond discussion of “should I live” or “should I die.” Completely beyond that. This is the real self. 

But you can experience this. But we have to learn this self. From this point, if you discuss “should I live, or should I commit suicide,” it depends on you. If you want to die, you can die. If you want to live, you can live. So strictly speaking, there is nothing external forcing you to live or to die. Nothing. Because real self is just going, completely beyond should I live or should I die. Completely this. This is the real self. 

Through zazen you can really taste this one. And that self is what? Dogen Zenji says, you should believe this one, self is no delusion, no confusion, no mistaken understanding. Completely beyond. What is this? You. Just depend on this you. That’s all. 

So it’s very absolute. That is nothing but the rhythm of your life. Jus the rhythm. Rhythm is not you should catch it, rhythm is you must be tuned in to the dial of this rhythm, and you should dance with it. That is your rhythm, completely beyond you like or you dislike, you should live or you should die. So when you really tune into the dial of this rhythm of the self, it is called truth. So truth is to follow the rhythm of the self in absolute reality. Completely beyond your like or dislike. So if you want to die, you can die. If you want to live, you can live. But you say, the soul, or lets do something that you like, because sooner or later we have to die. Or life is completely beyond good or bad, right and wrong, if so, why don’t you do something as you like? So even though it is alright to make a choice of unwholesome way of life, fine. It’s fine. Well is it alright to become a bank robber? It’s fine. But anyway if you become a bank robber, you have to accept something, so you must be in jail. Then at that time you say sooner or later we all die, so at that time all I have to do is just to die. But that is really cowardly, don’t you think so? It’s really cowardly. Because you are living in Buddha’s world, completely beyond you should live or you shouldn’t live. That is already you must be full aliveness. And then you make a choice, and something, so called bank robber. And then if you are put in jail, you say I can day, because sooner or later we have to die. But at that time you cannot die, because your pretty cowardly. 

Cowardice means you don’t realize where you are, what is living. You don’t. And then always you justify yourself in a certain aspect. So we say “We are Buddha.” Oh, we are Buddha, why don’t you do something as you like? But it’s really a conceptual way of life, very dry fish. 

##### 49:56

Death, or life, death is not something you can think. When something happens all I have to do is to die, and I am ready to die – well you can say so, because death is something you have to accept not as a dry fish, you as a human being accept death or life, good or bad, many things. All we have to do is facing opportunity and meeting circumstances, and then we have to keep our eyes open to deal with everything carefully. As much as possible, let’s live with people instead of hurting and interrupting others. That is all we have to do. Because if you choose many things, you can becoming a bank robber, but you don’ feel good if you become a bank robber. Even though by your determination you make a choice of your life, but actually you don’t feel good. And also you make yourself a trouble to yourself and also others. So it’s not a peaceful life. Full aliveness is to live in peace and harmony. If you don’t live in proper way, you don’t feel good, so your mind is very wavy, waves. So that is pretty hard, but if you always tune into the rhythm of life, rhythm of the self, so-called in the absolute reality, beyond you think I should live or I should die, at that time, you can feel peaceful, very peaceful. That’s why we have to open our eyes to see opportunity and meeting circumstances and take care of our life, because everything is changing constantly. 

So if you want to do zazen, you can do zazen. If you don’t want to do zazen, it’s not necessary to do zazen. But there is nothing external to force you to live or to die, or to do zazen or not to do zazen. Nothing external to fore you. That means, you can do anything. 

##### 53:38

> But do you know that such a time exists? To test I’m citing this old case: look!

“Do you know that such as time exists”: This is always the question: do you know that such a way of life exists. Yes, it is. Only you are ready to see it. IT’s there, constantly there. 

Do you have any questions? 

##### 54:30

**Question**: Are you talking about following the rhythm of our life in ... the truth ... how deeply are you talking about? On what level?

**Katagiri**: Absolute self means ... absolute means taking care of the big self. 

**Same person**: 

**Katagiri**: That’s why I gave the example about sickness. Sickness or death. IF you face if you are about to die, there is the self in absolute reality, that is absolute self, big self. That big self, the absolute self is not completely should I die or should I live long life. Completely there is absolute self going. All we have to do is keep tuning into the dial of this rhythm of absolute self, day by day. But mind is not, mind is always screaming, crying, shouting, and helping – trying to get something. I understand this is a human being, but all we have to do is tune in the dial to this. Anyway listen to absolute self, the self in absolute reality. That is call the truth, we say. Truth is not something far from us, truth is just focusing on the rhythm of self in absolute reality. It’s not so easy, but from now on, particularly in the 21st century, we have to live in that way, because everything is done away with means civilized, the more human beings are complicated. So your intellectual sense is very sharp, you can go any place. So you cannot make rational sense of life blind. So we have to know, we have to use it for this. Through this, using the rational sense of human life, and emotional and many things, and then we have to think how to live. In order to do this, we have to realize the self in absolute reality. Because everyone can live. Not can; everyone already everyone lives in a such a way. 

I took care of a young man who was about to die. At that time he screamed an shouted. He was very wild at that time, because he didn’t want to die. Well right before he died, he became quiet, because nothing to do. And also I was just by his bed, but I could not do anything, just be there. So I thought there is something big I cannot take care of, just going. And all he has to do is from moment to moment I watched him, well he was just tuning into the dial of the real reality, but on the other hand is head is screaming, but totally screaming is also in the rhythm ... of just going. But he didn’t realize. So all is going in a big river, just going. If you realize, it’s not giving up your life or death, we just jump into it, and realize it, and live, fully. Instead of become dry fish, so called death, or life. So we can do it, we can do it. 

##### 1:00:05

**Question**: Hojo-san? Yesterday you talked about the abbot of the Asian monastery who became paralyzed, and he said “well it’s my karma”? Had he become a dead fish or a dry fish, in saying that? 

**Katagiri**: I don’t know. We should invite him to ask. *[Laughter.]* Well it doesn’t matter, anyway, he already died. 

**Same person**: Well I guess I didn’t understand your point yesterday. I wasn’t quite clear about your criticism. 

**Katagiri**: Oh. At one point what I wanted to tell you was that ... yesterday I told that for many many years we don’t realize the rhythm of nature, the sun coming up in the east and setting in the west. We don’t realize just becoming one with it and without any doubt. For many, many years. But sooner or later, we have mind and start to think, “Why is the sun coming up in the east? What is the earth?” And then we try to explain that rhythm of nature with which human beings completely became one with it, without any questions. But when you have mind, you have to think, and then explain it. That is myths, stories, philosophy, psychology, etc.. And then finally we really enjoyed the story of myths and creating the story of myths countlessly, endlessly. So if you explain, endlessly we can go like this. So no end. This is a wonderful world, depending on the myths and philosophy, psychology, but there are nothing but explanations of oneness with nature, rhythm of nature. The rhythm of nature is exactly one with us, so it’s not necessary to think. So primitive people don’t have any ideas to think, just tuning in constantly, just like animals. Animals are instinctively tuning in, so they’re very happy, you know, compared to human beings. Or completely beyond happy or unhappy, just tuning in, day by day. Human beings can do that, but human beings have consciousness, so we always tune in just like animals, but immediately we have to think and explain. That is culture, coming up. And then we depend on juts the culture and myths, and philosophy, psychology, forgetting oneness with the rhythm of nature. Do you understand? 

And then we try to find out what is living, what is life, what is death. But life and death is going, so finally we try to get something we can depend on very strongly – that is happiness, position, fame, power, lots of things. And then if you get the power, you get the social status, then you think “This is all I wanted.” And then you say, “I am a happy boy,” you know? But finally, no one knows. You have to die how? ... becomes paralyzed. But that sickness paralyzing his body is something he didn’t expect before. But for Abbot of Eiheiji monastery, realize that he practiced for a long time, that’s why he said “Its my karma.” Well he accepts it very quietly. But the other person very confused, saying, “I didn’t know there was such a big trap to fall into,” because so far he believe becoming happy, a better life, is the final thing we wanted to do. But finally there is sickness, or paralyzation in this case. And then he couldn’t do anything. So that was a big disappointment, huge hole he has to fall into. 

Yesterday I told you this point, anyway. So I told you we have to return to the original nature of the self, so called we are born with nakedness, we die with nakedness. That means the self in absolute reality, just going. Nothing to put into anything extra. This is the basic rhythm of life. Do you understand?

If you have a certain position, regardless of whether you have capability to explain some aspect of Buddhism or not, if you are in a certain position, you have to do it, you have to sit down here and talk. *[He laughs.]* And teach. That’s pretty hard, don’t you think so? If you have enough capability to teach, that’s fine. But if you don’t, or even though you don’t satisfy completely, so endlessly we don’t feel satisfaction completely. But in the self in the absolute is going. Your life, the zen center, Minneapolis, my life, including all things, just one big rhythm of life, going. So I must be there, basically. But my head is always “no, don’t come.” Even once a week, “no, don’t come please.” But everyone comes! *[Laughter.]* So I cannot sleep in, you know? *[He laughs.]* I have to get up for you. SO my head is always screaming, “Help, please.” “Don’t come.” and “I want to sleep more,” but my life is going. That is the self in absolute reality. That’s wonderful. So all I have to do is tune into this rhythm. And the head screaming, fine, just like a flashing light, you know? Screaming, and then disappears the next moment, because the rhythm is going. I have to be just right on there, day by day. 

So according to Zen term of “original face”: big term there. Buddha Nature, and original face of the self, and big terms there. But practically speaking, it’s very realistic. Practically you have to do anyway, it’s not philosophical discussion.

**Question**: Yesterday you talked about the importance of having hopes ... and earlier this week you talked about less desire being full absorption in the present, ... How do you have a big hope without having lots of desire and lots of distraction and lots of suffering? 

**Katagiri**: If you have a big hope, you should have big trouble, anyway. *[Laughter.]* You should be prepared, anyway. You should have preliminary ... possibility of troubles, if you have big hope. If you want to have a big business, there is lots of trouble there. You should accept. 

*[Tape change]*

Because that’s also big trouble, don’t you think so? So you cannot say “I want to have big hope, but I want to have less trouble.” That is egoistic. So for instance I tell you puffer fish is very delicious. Very clean meat, transparent meat, very beautiful. If you go to Japan you can have it. But you have to cook it in proper way. If you make a mistake in the cooking, you die. It’s very quick, in a minute, you can die. So I want to eat puffer fish, but I don’t want to cook it in the proper way, because you need lots of trouble, regulations, and certificate, credentials from the city as cook. So you have to train, and it’s big trouble anyway. So it’s basically hard to get a job there. So I want to eat the pufferfish but I don’t want to cook it in the proper way. Same thing we do always in our life: I want to be happy, but I don’t want to do zazen, you know, because it’s painful. If you want to be happy, if you want to deepen your life in a big scale with the universe, why don’t you do it? That’s pretty good. 

So if you want to run a big business and make big money, you have to have big money, but simultaneously that money doesn’t stay with you constantly. Money is coming in and leaving you, next moment. Coming in leaving. That is circulation of the money. At that time you can run a big business. Look at the Zen Center is San Francisco. Actually they are not rich, they are very poor. In the end of the month, they don’t have any money! At the beginning of the every month, money is coming in; at the end of the month, all the money is gone. *[Laughter.]* But they have great ... and green restaurants, bakery, bookstores ... business. So money comes in, leaving, coming, leaving. But when you leave, it’s pretty hard, painful. We don’t want to leave the money anyway, we want to keep it. But at that time you cannot run a big business. If you want to have a big hope, anyway we should accept.

**Question**: Hojo-san, your example of yourself, you would like to sleep in in your mind, you said screaming. But it’s not your whole mind that screams, is it? Only part of your mind. *[Laughter.]*

**Katagiri**: Because I am teacher? 

**Same person**: Alright, here’s a question, if the whole mind is screaming, what do we tune into? And who does the tuning?

**Katagiri**: Well, you. I have to do it. 

**Same person**: Well that’s ...  So it’s not your whole mind screaming. 

**Katagiri**: Not whole mind, no. Just a part of my mind. As a whole, all I have to do is, to kill my life, or to give life. Do you understand? To give life in the light of a flashing light. So ... your life is going, so get up, and wash your face. If you feel sleepy, pour cold water on you. But sometimes I don’t like it. But, just do it. From moment to moment, that’s all. Is that okay?

**Same person**: Partly, I was thinking that, when I was sick for a couple weeks, or other people I have seen some part resist very much, you know? Sickness or getting up, or anything. But another part doesn’t seem to care either way, it’s just always the same. Just calm, you used the term calm or quiet. And I’ve experienced that and I’ve seen some people ... For example I worked a bit with the Indian people in Alaska, and in there tradition they had no religion, they were just hunters and fishermen. And when I got there there was lots of trouble: no work fro the men, and there was pain, and not enough food. But one thing that was striking was, I came from California Berkeley, and big difference was these people were as unhappy as people I left in the cities, but they didn’t seem to be as upset. I mean they were unhappy, but they were much calmer. I don’t know how to explain it exactly. 

**Katagiri**: I understand. 

**Same person**: So I mean they were hungry but they didn’t seem to care so much. They cared, but, you know, somebody died, but it wasn’t such a big deal as with people in the city. So some part was always just quiet. And I have seen the opposite in people, on the one hand scream, but on the other hand some part just goes. That’s what my question to you was about.

**Katagiri**: Yes, but for instance, Japan when it was temples, and the temperate was very cold, it was exactly same as outside in the winter, no heating system. I didn’t feel happy or unhappy, because I had never experienced wonderful house with perfect heating, I believed this is my life, so just accept. So no trouble. But if I *know* this... *[Laughter.]* My goodness!

Just two days ago, lights gone. Oh!

So if you don’t know, it’s something different from your situation, which you are there. At that time, no troubles, because we don’t know. But if you know, it’s big trouble. 

Buddhism is not discussing about that. Buddhism is anyway you have to know that happiness, no trouble, when you are right in the middle of unhappiness, because don;t know what is real happiness. So right in the middle of unhappiness, they are not confused.
