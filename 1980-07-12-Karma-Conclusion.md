This is my last talk on karma during this *[unintelligible]*. 

The term *karma* is popular for people who start to study Buddhism, but usually karma is translated as *action*. If I use English term *action*, it is a little different from the word karma in Sanskrit. Karma is not actually action. If you use the term karma, strictly speaking it emphasizes unmanifested karma, unmanifested action, unmanifested karmic impression left by your doing. If you use *action* in English, that is manifested karma which appears. If you understand karma like that, your life becomes decadent – because manifested karma always appears and disappears, appears and disappears, it doesn’t stay for long. But as you know pretty well, as you feel something related with human action through your reality, through your daily living, you can realize there is always something continued from yesterday, from the past up till now, and also which will continue toward the future, too. So you can realize this, something being continued from the beginningless past to the future. 

And also we always have big questions related with the problem of life and death. Does our life in this world end, or not? Will this life continue to the future or the next life, or is this life exactly the end? Well, this is a big question... that’s why from century after century we try to know what happens after death, discussing whether life continues or not. Even though we don’t understand, we don’t realize, we don’t find definite proof, yes, life is eternal. But no one finds proof, intellectually, or according to science, or whatever. Religiously or metaphysically, no one can find this proof. But still there is something you cannot ignore, because if you say this life is exactly the end, you really feel unstable, you can’t stand up there. And also, if I say, “Yes, life is eternal,” still you don’t feel comfortable, because you want to know what eternity is. So whatever I say or Buddha says about the problem of life and death, still there is a question. Even though you don’t understand, through your daily living you cannot ignore [that] life seems to continue. If you say this life is exactly the end when death comes, well you cannot have hope, you cannot have any effort to do something for all sentient beings, so your life is very naturally decadent, [stale], no hope, cold. 

So even though we cannot find definite proof whether life is eternal or not, we can feel something. If you ignore this feeling, you cannot stand up in the human world. So from century after century, [we ask] what is eternity? What’s going on after death? How can we explain this feeling in which we believe life is eternal? How can we explain? Century after century human beings have thought about this. Finally, in Buddhism, we find the teaching of karma. 

#### 

In ancient times, when the Buddha was alive, already Buddha used the term karma. But this karma he didn’t explain logically or metaphysically about karma, very simple statement in the *Sutta Nipata*, and *Dhammapada*, in ..., very simple explanation against the caste system. Do you remember about the caste system? If you were born in a noble family, you became a noble person from the beginning to end. You couldn’t be married with a soldier, etc., you have to marry a noble person. The four categories or castes were priests, and soldiers, and also slaves, and one more I forgot. Human classification. But Buddha was very against this system. That’s why yesterday I read, “Birth neither a brahman nor non-brahman makes. Life and conduct molds the brahman true.” So what is it that makes your life ... as a priest, or  slave, or ..., anything else: a painter, or sportsman, et cetera. Only by conduct, as karma – human action. If you act just like a ballplayer, at that time, you are a ballplayer. So by karma your life is defined. This is Buddha’s opinion. 

But if you say it like this, the term karma is used in the simplest way, because within this statement there are two things, cause and effect, simultaneously together there. If you act as something, then you become something, so that is the result. If I steal ten dollars from your pocket, I become a robber. That is effect and also cause. 

But cause and effect come from what? This is very important for us. Effect is not only the manifested karma, but also we have to think of unmanifested karma. Because even though you do something, you cannot say that there is always a result. That’s why there are three kinds of retribution: retribution experienced in ones’ present life, in the next life, in one’s subsequent life. Because you do something and [sometimes] immediately you can get the result, but this is pretty rare. So still even though you don’t get the result, still you can get the result with this life, next life, or life after next life.

That’s why with the development of Buddhism in history, the term karma is very ... popularized, using just action. That’s why people misunderstand karma. It’s not just action. That’s why when Buddhism is systematized by *Abhidharmakosha-shastra* – this is oldest Buddhist psychology, where all the terms are very carefully defined – very naturally there is a systematized explanation of karma. Because people use karma in wrong ways, as just action, but it’s not just action. Action is something that appears and disappears, but simultaneously [karma] is still remaining toward the future. Even if you don’t know, you can realize this through the reality. So finally, *Abhidharmakosha-shastra* says karma is divided into two: that is manifested karma and unmanifested karma. 
  
This unmanifested karma is continuing forever. It appears as retribution in this life, or next life, or in the life after next. From this point, the karma you have done never disappears. 

####  

Don’t misunderstand. If you understand human life according to karma which never disappears, at that time people fall into fatalism. But I don’t think so. That’s why yesterday I said that karma is sort of just energy. Because without karma, you cannot get into human life. Karma is *samskaras* according to twelvefold causation: this is the very basic human movement which leads you to get into the gate of the human world. So that is just like *vitality* in life. You don’t know what [it is], but already you are there, you are in the human world.

Why you are born as an American? Why was I born as a Japanese person? I don’t know. Why my mouth is just like this? I don’t know. *[Laughter.]* Someone asked me why my mouth is like this. I don’t know. *[He laughs.]* But already you are here; already there is your presence. Why? It’s very common, [the] vitality of life. That why vitality of life is just energy. 

This energy is nothing but dynamic motion. From this point, unmanifested karma is stored in individual life. But unmanifested karma is completely nothing but energy. Return to energy. Whatever you do in the past, good or bad or neutral, all actions return to you and are stored in your life. As beyond nature of good or bad or neutral. This is energy. But that energy stored in your storage. That storage is completely a closed door. No one can touch that door, no one can open it, but there is only one thing that can open it: time and occasion and conditions. By conditions, time and occasion, the door of storage opens and something comes up, just like a bubble. 

Time and occasion and conditions are very complicated, because you have to understand that time and occasion and conditions are related with all sentient beings, these are the conditions. But conditions are completely free. So you can create conditions, you can create opportunity... you can create time. All we can do is [decide] what kind of opportunity or condition we should create. That is always the point. Because karma is something continuous, forever, but it is already stored in your life, beyond the category of moral sense. But it appears sometimes. How? By your effort? No, by the conditions or opportunity you make. And then, it comes up. 

So condition, time, and occasion really are something free. Wherever you may go, you can create new conditions from moment to moment. For instance if you come here and attend a two week sesshin, and you feel good today, [but] tomorrow you don’t feel good, so you can go away. If you like, you can stay; if you don’t like, you can go away, any time, anywhere. Or if you want to scream here, you can scream. But you already have [the karma of an] intellectual, or noble, or smart, or clever person, so you cannot scream. But maybe if you are crazy, you can scream. *[Some laughter.]* 

There are always conditions and opportunities, open to everybody. It is always free. That is your life. If you like Zen, you can study it. If you don’t like it, please leave, any time. [It is the same for] Christianity, or whatever it is. 

So that is what is called emptiness, if you use the technical term. Or *interdependent co-origination*; you can use this term. But that term is pretty big, so that’s why I explain it simply like this. 

#### 

If we use the term [karma] according to my talk, the first characteristic of karma is [that it is split into] manifested karma and unmanifested karma, which never disappears, and also this unmanifested karma is yours, as property, as inheritance. You can never get away. ... this individual life. If you try, you cannot. This is one point.

The second point is, karma is emptiness. Karma is nothing but energy, or occasion and condition. That’s all; nothing but that.

So from this point you can say karma is your inheritance or your own property, but on the other hand karma is empty. So it’s very contradictory. 

But if you use the term karma is emptiness, at that time we misunderstand karma. “Oh, karma is emptiness? Why don’t you do as you like.” *[He laughs.]* I don’t want to explain the koan Dogen Zenji explained in *Sanji Gō*, *[Karmic] Retribution in the Three Times*, but let me explain this.

I want to say something about Buddha’s karma today. Buddha’s karma is not empty; karma is emptiness, or karma is not something inherited, what would you say, which seems to be a kind of ghost, haunting over your head. *[He laughs.]* “That’s your dark karma.” If you believe you have this karma, you did in the past, and it continues forever, at that time karma becomes monsters, ghosts... it’s really scary. So Buddha’s karma is. .. you cannot attach to that karma as inheritance, or you cannot say karma is emptiness. Because if you say “karma is emptiness,” well first of all you believe that karma should disappear. And then, it appears here. At that time emptiness is already an idea, opposed to karma. It doesn’t mean that. Emptiness is completely freedom. 

So Dogen Zenji points out this ... [???] One of the monks asks [Changsha] Zen Master (Chōsha Keishin), what is karmic hindrance? [Changsha] Zen Master says, “karmic hindrance is nothing but emptiness.” And then the monk says, “What is emptiness?” [Changsha] Zen Master says, “karmic hindrance.” So the monk didn’t understand what is karmic hindrance, [Changsha] said, “it’s emptiness.”

That’s why this is two ideas already: karmic hindrance, and emptiness. If you see the karma opposed to emptiness, or if you see the emptiness opposed to karma, already you have to destroy [the other] one of them: emptiness, or karma. Do you understand? ... Otherwise you don’t understand. There are two ideas of karma: karma is something inherited, so you never destroy it. And the other one is karma is nothing but conditions and opportunity and time; at that time, it’s emptiness, free. You like freedom. But if you attach to this, immediately a ghost appears. If you try to destroy the ghost, immediately freedom comes up, because we have to live toward the future, even though you see the ghost today, “I don’t like my karma,” but you cannot stop living in this world. You have to move from moment to moment toward the future. So even if you don’t want to, something compels you to move forward. So finally, if you attach to either one of them, you are confused. 

This is not karma as Buddha. Karma as Buddha is really something helping you, and you can learn something. You can learn about being human, and help all sentient beings. So from this point, practically, Buddha’s karma is not the idea of mythical matter, not a metaphysical entity you can discuss – Buddha’s karma is actual practice you have to do. Accepting both karma is inheritance, property, never destroyed, [and on the other hand] still karma is freedom for you. From this point, you have to accept both in your daily living. How? According to karma as inheritance, it is completely reflection as practice, reflection upon [yourself]. It is not being guilty; if you feel guilt, that is sort of a ghost appearing.

So karma is going on constantly from your past life to the future, that is you really see the depths of human life, the deep state of human life. So very naturally, even though for instance you say, “I’ll do it by myself, I don’t want anyone to help me,” et cetera – of course you can do [this]. Or you say, “I do something good always, I never make a mistake,” – of course, you can do [this]. But is that true? Are you sure? [No.] If you believe this, you seem to be strong, but it’s not strong, it’s just like a dog [barking]. It’s very cute, but it’s always barking at human beings. That barking is really two aspects: it seems to be demonstrating strength by barking – but on the other hand, it’s really weak. In order to protect weakness, you have to bark. That is *[unintelligible]*. But it’s very cute. *[Laughter.]* That’s why people like it so much. 

So you can say, of course we can always do something good, but on the other hand, if you understand human life pretty deeply, you cannot say, “I never make a mistake.” It’s fine if you believe that... but I don’t think so. 

For instance, “Don’t kill anything”: this is a Buddhist precept. Can you observe this precept perfectly? No. You kill already. While walking on the street, you step on ants, even though you don’t know it. Or you always kill vegetables and eat them, to support your life. So exactly you always break the Buddha’s precept. But it’s not necessarily to be disappointed; still Buddha’s precept is Buddha’s precept. Because we always, consciously or unconsciously, break Buddha’s precept, that’s why we need Buddha’s precept. If you don’t break it, it’s not necessary to have Buddha’s precept. *[Some laughter.]* So if you say “Buddha’s precept is do not kill” – you already kill. That’s why Buddha’s precept comes up here.

Next, “Don’t steal anything.” Well, maybe you steal something. The other day I went to Sears. I didn’t notice the registers there, and that they paid money. Back by the registers, there is a certain ..., I didn’t remember what it is, but I took it. *[Laughter.]* It was already in my hand. Tomoe said, “You’re a priest!” *[Laughter.]* I said, “Oh, yes! I’m sorry.” 

Consciously or unconsciously, we do something wrong. That’s why Buddha says day after day, “Please, don’t kill. Please, don’t steal.” Even though you say, “I am a good boy” – uh-oh, no. It’s really *[unintelligible]*. *[Laughter]*.

So that’s why that is karma. Unmanifested karma is going on in your life. You should remember this. And then at that time, you can be humble, modest. With humility toward yourself, and toward others. That is the practice of reflection upon yourself. 

According to the karma is emptiness, that is you can be brave. You can be brave, you can move toward the future, day after day, without being stuck in the ghost of karma. So, you can move, without being stuck in the result you have done. I don’t mean you should ignore the result which you have done; of course we should [pay attention], because your actions leave something as an impression in your life. So from this point you carry whatever you do on your back. That is reflection. Nevertheless, you cannot be stuck there. You should move toward life in the future. This is really emptiness. Karma is emptiness. 

So you can move, day after day, in order develop your life, deepen your life, in order to help all sentient beings according to Buddha’s way. That is *Right Effort*. Right Effort is not like a wild pig rushing in with determination, ignoring others around you. Kicking other people out, just like in business, and politics. Listen to the political speeches, always each politician criticizes the others: “I am a good politician, not him.” It seems to be brave, but I don’t think this is the Buddhist way. So we have to move toward the future with bravery, but it doesn’t mean kicking out anybody around you. We have to reflect with humility, humbleness, and also modesty. Nevertheless, your life must be *majestic*, and grand. That is day by day, you can move toward the future. That is Right Effort. At that time, karma really becomes Buddha. 

That Buddha’s karma is transcending the moral sense. Karma is inheritance, or karma is emptiness – completely beyond. At that time, it becomes Buddha. That karma, Buddha’s karma, is not a matter of metaphysical or philosophical discussion, it is actual practice you have to do. Accepting ... meaning of karma. And then learning human life. At that time it’s really Buddha’s karma.

That is Dogen’s understanding of karma. So if you read the section Karmic Retribution in this book (*Zen Master Dogen: An Introduction with Selected Writings*, by Yuho Yokoi with Daizen Victoria), you can understand the meaning of karma. That’s why in Buddhism we have the practice of repentance. Repentance is not like apologizing in front of your boss. Repentance is religious ritual coming from your deep understanding of human life. If you always make repentance of your life in front of the boss, that is not real repentance. So in Buddhism we say *formless repentance*. No one’s in front of you, because repentance comes from very deep understanding of human life. If you really understand karma, you can make repentance very straightforwardly with your life. And also we can take one step into the human world with the triple treasure: we take refuge in the Buddha, we take refuge in the Dharma, we take refuge in the sangha. This is really bodhisattva life, bodhisattva practice. 

Do you have any questions?

**Question**: Hojo-san? Do you remember in Huston Smiths lecture’s, I think it was the last one, he said, “*[unintelligible]*” And he talked about grace being always present. General grace in Buddhism. His idea is there a similarity being Saint John and Dogen in this way. I wonder if maybe that concept of right conditions and time would be a way of staying in contact with that grace, or maybe ... want to do that.

**Katagiri**: Grace is not something coming from heaven, or from some other person, or something else, okay? Grace in Buddhism is actual practice, process itself. When you do gassho, gassho is human action. One point is ... as inheritance, maybe you did in the past, as a Buddhist or not. Maybe ... related with Buddhism, that’s why you can do this now. That’s maybe you can understand in that way. On the other hand, gassho is nothing but energy... [... tape change ...] On the other hand, gassho is nothing but time, and occasion, and conditions. And then, just do it, in the proper way, as best as you can. At that time, gassho is not actually you doing gassho, gassho becomes real gassho. And then you can learn something from the gassho. That is grace. Is that okay? 

Well, I don’t know what is grace. *[Laughter.]* But I know I know, but I cannot explain. Gassho is, for instance my second teacher always was very strict whenever gassho, and walking, and zazen posture, and chanting, and using the toilet – whatever you do, he was very strict. I felt funny, because it’s very formality. You don’t want formality; not only me, everyone doesn’t like formality. You know, gassho like this, and when you use the toilet, first gassho. *[Laughter.]* Really, I felt funny. But now I really understand this; this is really grace. 

*[He laughs.]* So in sesshin, you don’t like sitting without doing anything. But I always tell you, whatever you feel, like or dislike, exhaustion, or whatever you do, you think. Whatever you think, put them aside, and then all you have to do is do your best to do zazen with your wholeheartedness. That’s enough. Even for a moment. That is grace. It’s [very much] grace. 

So if grace doesn’t come from somebody, or from heaven, or from hell, nowhere, nobody – it really comes up from you. That from you is really grace itself.

**Same person**: Could you say grace is interdependent?

**Katagiri**: Yes... or not. *[He laughs.]* Interdependence co-origination is ideas, okay? Grace is not ideas. Grace is your life, which is fully alive, vividly, don’t you think? This is grace. Even though you say, “I experience grace,” and then, if your life is messy, “That’s not grace.” If you experience grace from heaven or somewhere, anyway grace is supposed to be something to help your life. Not messy. Maybe a little bit messy, but not much.

Is that okay? *[He laughs.]* So of course I can say yes, grace is interdependent co-origination. But it’s not. You should be right on interdependent co-origination. Right on.
