Today I would like to talk about the third of Ten Prohibitory Precepts: abstaining from sexual greed. And the comment by Dogen Zenji says:

> The threefold wheel is pure and clean, nothing to be desired. They go along together with the Buddhas.

So today, I would like to the threefold wheel. Then maybe next time I can explain the meaning of purity and cleanness. 

I think in the meal sutra we chant almost the same thing, “The threefold wheel is pure and clean.” We chant that every time we have a meal. In that sutra, it says “May donors, receivers, and offerings” – those are in this case the threefold wheel. But here, the three means body, mouth, and mind. This is three categories of human life: the body, the mouth, and mind. Sometimes we translate this as body, speech, and thought. So with the mouth we can speak, and with the mind we can have thoughts. Sometimes the three wheels are translated as the body, speech and thoughts. And also one more meaning is greed, anger, and ignorance. So the threefold wheel has two meanings: one is body, mouth, and mind, and the other one is greed, anger, and ignorance. 

The wheel is a word translated from Sanskrit, so-called mandala. Every knows mandala, because Tibetan Buddhism is very popular in the United States, so everyone knows the mandala. Mandala is a kind of the diagrammatic picture which represents the cosmic structure of the Buddha and bodhisattvas and other divine beings. This is we call the mandala. So for the world mandala in Sanskrit is translated into Chinese as dan, meaning platform. Or another translation is aggregates. And the other one is a little bit difficult to translate it, so I will explain. In Japanese, *rinengusoku*. Rin is wheel. En is circle, or perfect. Gu is with, or in, or to have already. And soku is being contented with. I want to explain in more detail about this rinengusoku. Strictly speaking, rin means magnificent. Wheel means magnificent. En is usually translated as perfect, but literally it is a circle. Circle means inexhaustible. The circle is the symbol of the cosmic universe, which is inexhaustible, endless, boundless – this is the symbol of the circle. So the circle is translated sometimes as perfection. Let me translate this one as inexhaustible. Gu a being endowed with everything. So everything is endowed with all. In other words, you are endowed with all; that means the universe. That is the meaning of gu. Soku is everything arises from this basis of existence. The basis of existence is that which each of the beings is endowed with all. This is the basis of existence. Soku means everything arises from this basis of existence. 

So from this point, if you put of the letters together, maybe we can understand like this: Each of body, mind, and mouth, or each of greed, anger, and [ignorance], is endowed with everything, and becomes the basis of existence with magnificent and inexhaustible time and space. Each of body, mouth, and mind, or each of greed, anger, and ignorance, is endowed with everything, the universe, and becomes fundamental with the magnificent and inexhaustible time and space. This is the meaning of wheel. So threefold wheel means each of your body, mouth, and mind, and your anger, hatred, and ignorance, is already endowed with functioning of the cosmic universe, and becomes fundamental for your existence. And it is constantly going without stopping even for a moment. This is the meaning of the wheel. 

But as you know pretty well, usually we understand body, mouth, and mind are not pure; we believe they are something contaminated, or deluded. Much less you cannot believe that greed, anger and ignorance are of course something deluded. So that is a very common understand of the three wheels. In this case, that’s why in Buddhism, if you see threefold body, mouth, mind, or greed, anger, ignorance, in terms of ordinary viewpoint, in other words deluded viewpoint, they become poisons. So we say the Three Poisons. Greed, anger, and ignorance are called the Three Poisons. So in terms of the ordinary sense, they are the Three Poisons. But in terms of Bodhisattvas and Buddhas, three poisons are not poisonous, but wheels. That means something more than the speculation of ordinary beings. This is a wheel. I think in terms of Bodhisattvas and Buddhas, each of the three, greed, anger, and ignorance becomes a wheel. I think instead of the poison of anger, in terms of Buddha, it is the wheel of anger. The wheel of greed, the wheel of ignorance. That is the real nature of the three categories of existence, so called body, mouth and mind. And also from the body and mind we can create the world based on greed, anger, ignorance. So even the world created by the human body and human mind, so called greed, anger, ignorance, they are nothing but the wheels of greed, anger, ignorance. 

So how can you turn the poison of greed into the wheel of greed? Simply speaking, as you know, the Buddha taught us we are Buddha.
