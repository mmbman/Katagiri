Completely beyond individual control; this is also karma. We can realize very contradictory state of situation. Karma is always within individual life from this point. There is no way that we have to take responsibility for our actions for our individual life; there is not other way. On the other hand, karma is completely beyond individual control. Regardless of whether you like or dislike; regardless of whether you control or not; regardless of (whether) it is something created by somebody else, or whatever it is, anyway, it is completely beyond your control. As long as it is within you, that is something we have to take responsibility (for). So that is very contradictory. That is also important point: we have to understand karma and how we should be free from karmas. But it takes time. It really takes time. But if you study [Buddhism](glossary#buddhism), you understand, very well. 

And because, in bulletin, we have a the .... ((???)) Yesterday I told you four stages of meditation. This is really Zen meditation, which everyone can experience in the realm of form, the world. There ... I don't know how to explain it... I'll go a different way [laughter] ... Anyway. 

Yesterday I told you, karma is, according to twelve chain causation, karma is [samskara](glossary#samskara), and also bhava. Is first stage of human movement. This is called samskara. And the other one is bhava, existence. Existene is present situation, what you are, or what... is, what consciousness is. Whatever it is. Anyway, that is existence. Something existent is alive in the [dualistic](glossary#dualistic) world. That is existence, being. 

##### 4:26

The karma as [samskara](glossary#samskara), meaning ... the quality of karma under samskara is avidja, I told you before, yesterday. Advija, ignorance. Ignorance is a state that one is doomed not to know the truth as it is, exactly. Although, one is always present in it. We are present, cool in fact. This is what is called avidja; affliction, pain. Is pain, don't you think so? You are there, your are doing [zazen](glossary#zazen), but you don't know what is zazen. If you cannot pin down what is zazen, it's pretty painful, isn't it? You are... if I say, I am Katagiri, I know who I am, but how much I know? Just a speck of dust. Or, I have lived almost 52 years... or not almost; exactly. [laughter] So, 52 years, that is my life. If I say that is my life, already, it seems that I know what life is. But how much I know life? I don't know.

But then, life is, I am already right in the middle of that life, even though I don't know. That is really pain, don't you think so? That is really basic nature of human life, which is called avidja. Avija is not karma, but it is quality of karma. In other words, supported karma, preserved karma. So it's really pain, affliction. It's not karma, it's klesha, we say, klesha. Klesha is not exactly ignorance ... we say klesha is pain or affliction. That is avidja. 

So very basic nature of pain, or affliction, or [suffering](glossary#suffering). That's why Buddha says life is characterized by suffering. We are right in the middle of the truth, but we don't know. We are really doomed not to know. We don't... try to ignore. We want to know. But we don't know. We are doomed. That is really avidja. 

The quality of karma is ignorance. When you say karma as [samskara](glossary#samskara); remember this point. 

And also, the karma as bhava. Karma becomes the mainstream of one's present world, because karma as smaskara is first movement. What movement. It's based on affliction, pain. We are there. This is very first movement of human beings. And then, this movement really create ... this movement is really... the driving force of leading the human being to enter the human world, [dualistic](glossary#dualistic) world. That is consciousness, such as consciousness, name and form, six consciousnesses, also contact, and feeling, and craving, and grasping, then, existence. So, exactly, this karma as [samskara](glossary#samskara) is really mainspring of leading you enter into human world. That is which is called existence. Karma as existence. So from this point you know pretty well, karma as existence is what? Already, pain, affliction. We don't know what the truth is, we want to know, but we cannot know. 

Finally, we don't know what to do, but that is already first movement. That's why quality of first movement is affliction. And then, already this affliction, this movement, guides you how to create human world. That is consciousness. 

From this point, karma is exactly within us. And simultaneously, not ours, not ours. It means that we are completely powerless before karma. It's like ... you really think karma, which is sort of very ... avocado seed. But, it's not avocado seed. If you understand karma as avocado seed, that karma is already starting to be systemized with your consciousness. Karma is not avocado seed. No matter how long you peel banana trees, you cannot find anything which is called 'karma'. No how matter how long you peel the skin, take out the bones and picking into the marrow, you cannot find anything at all. You cannot find something that is called karma. 

Karma is really source of individual life. But that is not the inside, that is not outside. How can I know? This is the whole body, pretty much? That's why it's really connected with consciousness, according to twelvefold causation. It's really connected with consciousness, name and form [etc.] ... last, existence. That means, karma is directly, closely related to human body, human world. Strictly speaking, karma is basis of human life, but we don't know how to know, so that is really human body. 

Through this human body and mind, we have to know what karma is, what is the basis of human existence. That is really, no other better way. No other way; just to meditate, do [zazen](glossary#zazen), and then you can understand this. 

##### 15:00

The questions is; there is one question... According to Buddhist psychology, karma is divided into two: one is manifested, second is unmanifested karma. Why is it that we have to emphasize unmanifested karma? Because, karma is already with us and occupying the basis of human existence. And also this karma is sort of property, I told you yesterday; property.
