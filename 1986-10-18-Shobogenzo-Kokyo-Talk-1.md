There are many cultural forms in every country, through which we can understand people's life and histories and heart. “There are many cultural forms” means customs, habits, manners, rituals – many forms. And those forms are not merely forms, because they are just like a mirror, [in] which people's lives are reflected. So that's why we have to make every possible effort to understand different cultures, because it is not merely forms, it is a mirror. We can see our mind, our life in it. 

So, in the United States, you have already lots of historical background, religious background, and also cultural background; many forms. Through those forms, people understand who you are, what kind of life you have followed. So, your cultural forms are very important for us. 

What is a mirror? What is a mirror which the essence of man's existence is reflected in? What is the mirror? Not only the cultural forms, but we have to understand what is the mirror that the essential nature of human life is reflected in. 

So, Dōgen Zenji mentions in *Shōbōgenzō*, [?] “*Kokyo*” in Japanese, which means literally “old mirror” or “ancient mirror.” This is a very interesting chapter. 

So I mentioned mirror is that which you can see the essential nature of human life reflected in it, in that mirror. So, that mirror implies kind of vastness, vast expanse of sky, or space, where all sentient beings coexist simultaneously in peace, in silence, in harmony. Plainly speaking, maybe it is called sometimes “the truth.” So, this is a mirror. 

So, in other words, “what is a mirror” means “what is the truth.” 

So how is that mirror exercised? How does that mirror reflect? How do all sentient beings reflect in that mirror? 

First point, Dōgen Zenji mentions like this – it is a little bit difficult, but I will explain later, okay? 

> It is the ancient mirror that buddhas and patriarchs have received, preserved, and transmitted personally. They are all the same and one with view, face, shape, mold, practice, and enlightenment. When the barbarian comes, he is reflected in that mirror. 8000 or 10000. Also, when the Chinese comes, he is reflected in it, containing one moment or 10,000 years. Also, when the past, the present, or the buddhas and ancestors come, they are reflected. 

This is the first point. What is a mirror? Dōgen Zenji says it is the ancient mirror that Buddhas and ancestors have received and preserved and transmitted personally. “Personally” means historically or personally, anyway from generation to generation, each single buddha and ancestor received this mirror and preserved, maintained, preserved and transmitted. Tried to hand it down from generation to generation. So, that mirror is very personal, but it’s not personal, because many buddhas, many ancestors tried to receive and preserve and transmit it from generation to generation – the *same* mirror. So, it is public, completely public. It’s personal, but it’s public. That means you cannot hold it by yourself. If you realize how important, how sublime human life is through your life, you cannot hold it. You have to receive it and maintain it and preserve it and transmit it to next generations. This is natural! 

So, what is the essence of human life which you have attained enlightenment? Saying how sublime human life is, how important human life is. So, this is in your... This enlightenment is really personal, but it’s not personal, it’s really for everyone. So, naturally it’s coming up, you try to receive it and maintain it and transmit it. So, you want to say something. You want to say something about it to your sons, to your daughters, to your friends, to the next generations. So, it becomes public. Okay? 

So, that is a mirror. *Mirror* means the same and one place where all sentient beings live in peace, in harmony, beyond your speculation. So-called, we say, *truth*. Truth is an inexplainable state of existence, which is constantly going as they truly are. That is temporally we call *truth*. Sometimes we say *universe*, *whole universe*. Because it’s pretty hard to explain it in words. 

#### 10:04

And then he says,

> They are all the same and one with view, face, shape, mold, practice, enlightenment. 

If buddhas and ancestors are reflected in that mirror, all buddhas and ancestors have the same and one view. No difference. If you realize the sublimity of human life through your life, this is not different from that which people have experienced. It’s exactly the same things. So, very naturally, when buddhas and ancestors are reflected in that mirror, they have the same and one view. 

And also, the face, look, is of course different, but they are the same. All buddhas and ancestors – same look, same face. Different, but they are the same and one. So, exactly they are different, but you can see the same feeling. 

Do you understand? For instance, American, if you live in United States for many, many years. Everyone has a different look – but if your life is reflected in the same mirror, so-called American culture, you can see same look. Can’t you? Sure, you can see. “Oh, you are American.”

Yes, you can. *[Laughter.]* So, from now on, you try. Particularly, when you go to Europe, and not necessarily in Japan, Japan is completely different, you know, all are Japanese. But, if you go to Europe, you are almost same as Europeans. But, still you are American. You can realize. People say, “Are you American?” Yes, you can see. So, looks are different, but exactly same look, so-called American. 

But not culture mirror – if your life is reflected in a huge spiritual mirror, exactly everyone has the same look. Yes, it is true. Completely beyond races, completely beyond the cultural background, you become exactly same look. 

And also, he says “shape.” Shape and the mold. Mold is, actually, in general sense, shape means, you know, same type, same form. Gassho, this is a shape, you know, gassho form. If you do gassho, there is a certain shape there. If you do zazen, you have same shape, so-called five *skandhas* – nose, mouth and ears. But, exactly same shape. If your life is reflected in the spiritual [mirror], that huge mirror, your shape becomes the same with buddhas, ancestors, everyone. If you don’t believe me, do zazen! *[He laughs.]* Your shape becomes the same. Even though you don’t face me, but I can see the same shape from your back. So, this is true. 

And also, mold, the same and one with mold. In a usual sense, it’s not good, because we try to mold your life into the one shape, the same and one pattern. You don’t like it, you know? This is morality, ethics, et cetera. But if your life is reflected in that mirror, which the essential nature of human existence is reflected, your life becomes exactly same mold; your life is mold in the same one pattern. That means, so-called *faith*. Stability, complete stability wherever you may go. One pattern. Even though circumstances changes, but your pattern is exactly the same and one. 

That’s why in Zen, we say, “wherever you may go, or in whatever you may be, you must be master of yourself.” This is exactly your life is *molded* into the same and one pattern. But that one pattern is always changeable, in every circumstances, freely. 

This is called *samadhi*. We say *samadhi* in Buddhism. 

And also, practice and enlightenment in so as to reach this same and one with view, and faith, shape, and mold – we try to practice. And then through that practice, you will see the certain result. 

So, I think the naturally, if your life is reflected in that mirror, you have a same and one type of life. Whatever you do, you are always going the same road, with the people, exactly same. This is the practice. 

And then, the same result. That means you can walk hand-in-hand with people. That is what? Peace, harmony, we say.

So, when your life is completely reflected in that mirror, you can have the same and one pattern, and your looks, your heart, your lifestyles are all the same. But from that same and one pattern, there are a myriad, myriad different types of life coming up, freely, constantly, under all circumstances. That’s why – what is that? This is a practice. And what is this? Through that practice, what will you get? That is a result, so-called peace and harmony, in your life. 

So, that’s why Dōgen Zenji says it here like this: 

> When the Barbarian comes, he is reflected in that mirror.

 Anyway, when the Barbarian, American comes... *[Someone laughs.]* ... Americans are reflected, Japanese comes, Japanese are reflected, naturally. With no complaints. 
 
 When the Christian comes, the Christians are reflected, anyway. But human beings are really stubborn, you know? I always say, we are just like an octopus. *[He chuckles.]* Do you know the octopus? You know, when you become a fisherman, it’s very easy, simple way to catch the octopus. You just put any kind of pot, tied with the rope, and many pot, you know, on the rope, and then sink them to the bottom of the ocean. And then the octopus get into each pot. This is called “my territory,” okay? So-called Christianity, Buddhism, Americans – many pots there. Times, or space, and customs. And then each pot starts to move – so-called functioning of American culture, Japanese culture. And each octopus always become *tight*, you know? Whenever the pot moves, always tight. And then finally, we can easily get it. 
 
Do you understand? *[He laughs.]* This is all of you. You are just like an octopus. Human beings, just like an octopus.

Try to see the people, and talk about the Buddhism, and the Christianity, and the whatever different cultures, and talking about you, try to understand, you know. The more you try to talk, the more people don’t understand you. *[He laughs.]* You try to talk about Buddhism, how wonderful it is, how different it is from other religions. People don’t trust you, people don’t understand! So how stubborn we are. Just like an octopus. 

And then, what is this? This is exactly something people can depend on and see and believe. But it is nothing but egoistic; that’s it. 

So finally, what happens? It is called *death*. Commits suicide by itself, by themselves, you know? By egoistic, by the prejudice, finally the octopus has to die. Commits suicide by themselves. But people don’t understand this one. 

Okay, this is our first point: what is the mirror. 

#### 22: 26

The second [point], Dōgen Zenji [says] like this. 

> His statement, “not dim, either inside and outside,” means that inside is not against outside and vice versa. There is no front or back, both of them are visible as one whole. The words “mind and eye resembling each other” means that a man sees a man and that mind is his eye, both inside and outside the mirror. Both of them being visible as one whole, the present self and the world are both the inside and outside of the mirror. 

There is no difference such as self and others. Both of them being visible as one whole. Others are self, self is others. 

Here is the second point of what is a mirror. He says mirror is completely clear, inside and outside. Completely clear. Actual usual mirror has a front is very clear and a back is not clear, a little bit dim, you know? But this mirror is completely clear inside and outside. And also it doesn’t have a certain concept, so-called inside, opposed to outside. Inside is simultaneously outside. Outside is simultaneously inside. So there is no particular limitations. 

So that’s why it’s very clear, very clear. In other words, kind of transparent, completely transparent. If you try to see this altar through my body, you can see this altar through my body, exactly, because it’s very clear. 

So no inside, no outside. And also he says no front or back. So finally in the usual mirror there are front and back. But actually this mirror doesn’t have a particular category so-called front or back. And also both of them are visible as one whole. 

And also, this is the actual, true mirror, if you want to see the essential nature of human existence through that mirror. That mirror must be completely clear without any limitation of outside, inside or front or back. Exactly clear. But it is a mirror; when you stand up, your life is reflected. 

So that is the image of the mirror. Okay?

But if you say, if you use a mirror, I think we naturally we can imagine kind of a front and back. Otherwise it’s very difficult to understand the mirror. So let’s use a front and back. If it has front and back, what is this? What’s the relation between the front and back? It says it is like mind and eyes.

So here it says, “the words mind and eyes resembling each other means that a man sees a man, and the mind is his eye both inside and outside the mirror, both of them being visible as one whole.” So it is just like a relationship between the mind and the eye. Mind manifests itself in the eye. So you can see the mind in your eyes. 

So mind itself constantly manifests itself in the eye. And the eye manifests itself outside based on the mind. So eyes always functioning externally based on the mind. So mind and eyes, front and back, are exactly the same. Both are same. Temporarily we can say mind and eyes. But if you want to know your mind, just you can see your eyes, that’s it. And then you can see your mind in the eyes. And if you have opportunity to see your mind, you can see your eyes in the mind. 

So this is just like a man look at man. You look at yourself. 

Or maybe, there is a Zen story that if you look at the well, you know, the well looks at you. So well and you are same. Donkey pokes his head into the well and look at his face. And then donkey look at well, well looks at donkey. Finally, donkey looks at donkey, well looks at well. Because donkey and the well – in the donkey there is a well, in the well there is a donkey. So who is seeing whom? Nothing. Just when you see the donkey, just the donkey look at what? Donkey. 

This is exactly the state of the functioning of the mirror. 

And “the present self and the world are both the inside and outside of the mirror. There is no difference such as self and others, both of them being visible as one whole.” Others are self and self is others. 

So that mirror is exactly the same and one place where all sentient beings coexist in peace and harmony. Talking with each other, in peace and harmony; walking with each other hand in hand, in peace. 

So very naturally camels are reflected in that mirror with the elephant in Africa. Africa’s elephant and camel talks with each other, walking with each other in the same place. 

Or, if you look at the mirror, this mirror, *I* look at the mirror, *you* stand up in the mirror. And then both are different faces. Different forms, different lifestyles. But if your life is reflected in that mirror and I am reflected in that mirror, different faces come together and finally different faces become one. So your looks, my looks is reflected in the same mirror, but it’s the same. Through that, if you look at that mirror very calmly, you can see the difference. But through that difference you can see the same. 

Well, that’s why we have to make every possible effort to understand the different cultures, different personalities. Why we have to stand up in a different personalities, why we have to live with the people who have completely different personalities. *Why*? Because we are same. 

So let’s live together in peace and harmony with a group, with people who have completely different lifestyle, personalities from you. That means, you have to stand up in that mirror. The people stand up in that mirror, and with a calm mind continually see different shapes, different faces. Finally, different faces become one and same face. Through that exactly same essential nature of human existence. 

This is a spiritual mirror, so-called ancient mirror, so-called truth. 

#### 33:34

And the third point, there is an interesting story. 

Xuansha came forward saying, “What will become of them when the clear mirror appears suddenly?”

[Xuefeng (Hsueh-feng, Seppō Zen Master) said,] “Both of them will [dis]appear.”

“I don’t agree.”

“What then?” 

“Ask me again, please.” 

“What will become of them when the clear mirror appears suddenly?”

“It will disintegrate.” 

It means, Xuansha talks about something: when the clear mirror meets with another clear mirror, then what happens? “What happens” means, when you see the exactly clear mirror, because you are also a clear mirror, so when the clear mirror meets with clear mirror, what happens? Then Seppō (Xuefeng) says, “Both.” Both clear mirrors means I and you disappear. Because both are clear mirror. I and you are clear mirror. 

And then Gensha Zen Master (Xuansha) says, “I am not satisfied [with] that one.” 

So Seppō says, “How about you? How can you say?”

And then Gensha Zen Master says, “It completely disintegrates.” 

In other words, *[there is some discussion about the correct word,]* slivers. [...] Myriad, myriad broken pieces. Completely broken – tiny, tiny broken pieces. 

And then Dōgen Zenji try to explain it, comment on this story. And finally, in the last part of explanation, he says:

> What then is the shape of the broken pieces? 

He says it is:

> “Eternally deep water and the moon in the sky.”

(*Transcriber’s Note:* From the Sōtōshū *Shōbōgenzō* translation: “Blue depths ten thousand ages old, the moon in an empty realm.”)

It means, we try to understand, we try to approach to what the truth is, what the clear mirror is. Through our experience, through our studies, through our practice, we try to. And then when you reach exactly true clear mirror, means you meet exactly that clear mirror. Complete, there is no particular mirror, between the you and mirror. So, mirror is completely broken pieces. 

What do I mean? That means, finally, broken pieces of culture, your lifestyle, your life. When you get up in the morning, this is a mirror. When you do gassho, this is a mirror. When you see the trees in autumn, this is a mirror. You can see the essential nature of human existence. So, tree is not a part of the creature [...] different from of human beings. You can see the trees; through that you can see your life. So, finally, tree is clear mirror. 

When you talk with a mirror, this is a poem. You can create a poem. But the poem is nothing but a mirror. Through the mirror, you can see that kind of a sentimental and huge world, something more than intellectual. But it is not *exactly*. Something you have to attach to it, but through that words, there is a complete inconceivable world there. That means essential nature of human existence. Through the poem, you have to see this. Through the trees, you have to see this essential nature of human existence. 

So, very naturally, your five *skandhas*, your body, is your mirror. Your thinking is also your mirror. 

If you have a particular occupation, so-called mountaineer, mountaineer is your mirror. So, through the mountaineer, you can learn life of the trees, life of the birds, life of the frogs. Life of the Americans, life of the Japanese – you can learn. Through the rock climbers, you can see the same life of the trees and frogs and rivers and skies. 

So, that’s why, we try to see what the real mirror is, where our life is reflected simultaneously with all sentient beings. All sentient beings are reflected in the mirror. 

And then when you see this mirror, what happens? 

No partitions, so-called “here is the particular mirror.” No. 

So, completely when you see that mirror, your life is completely broken pieces. It means your nose is just your nose. Your five *skandhas* are just five *skandhas*. 

*[Tape change.]*

We have to see. We have to see, we have to learn. We have to learn your body, your mind, your life, anyway. 

So, that’s why Dōgen Zenji says to study Buddhism is to study the self. Very naturally, we have to start to learn what human life is. 

But in order to learn the self and your life, it’s very difficult to learn the essential nature of human existence in public, in the universe. Because we have lots of prejudice. Just like an octopus. 

So, one by one, we have to take it off, those prejudices. 

So, what is the practice? In order to meet this mirror, we have to practice the same things as Buddhas and ancestors in the past did. This is our practice. Not only the Japanese: the Americans, and the Europeans, whoever you are, we have to practice this. 

Our essential, simple practice is, basically, simple practice is the *zazen* we do. 

So, what is zazen? Zazen is exactly... I think, [to] take off your each prejudice. How? Just sit down. Zazen itself is [to] become a huge mirror. Your life is reflected, beyond your speculation. So, let’s reflect your body and mind in that mirror. That is, just sit down there. And naturally, you can see. 

This is a very basic, simple practice we do. 

Okay. Do you have a question? 

#### 43:26

**Question:** What happens when... I don’t know if I am phrasing this correctly, okay? When a clear mirror meets a mirror that is not clear? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** If you see two mirrors... *[He laughs.]* ... it’s not clear. But, originally it’s very clear, that’s why Seppō Zen Master says, “Both,” “both of them disappear.” Clear mirror, your body and mind is very transparent, my body and mind is completely transparent – and meet together and put together – both disappear. Do you understand? Just like a Casper. 

*[Laughter.]*

**Someone:** Like what?

**Katagiri Roshi:** “Casper.” Two Caspers see each other, meet together, walk together – finally disappear. 

#### 44:40

**Question:** Hojo-san? How does a mirror get back to that clear state? How does a tarnished, dirty, disgusting mirror *[they chuckles]* turn into a clear mirror again? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Well, it’s *always* a clear mirror. 

**Questioner:** Why doesn’t it always *seem* clear? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** That is your understanding. But originally... That’s why the essential nature of human exists, not only your mirror. If you see mirror just in terms of your point of view, it’s not clear. But it’s originally clear. Just like a mirror of the trees, a mirror of the flowers, a mirror of the sky. 

So, all are clear, completely. From the beginning to end, it’s clear. Alright? 

You say, “Uh-uh-uh.” 

**Questioner:** How do you get from there to there? How do you see that? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** You say, “Uh-uh.” This is already you accept a clear mirror; that’s why you say, “Uh-uh.” Do you understand? 

**Someone:** *[Laughs.]* Have mercy!

**Katagiri Roshi:** Before you say, “Uh-uh,” you already accept a clear mirror. That’s why you say, “Uh-uh.” Do you understand? Can you? No? 

**Questioner:** I don’t understand the last thing you said. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Well, it means, for instance: I originally accept all of you, before I think or I don’t think. Alright? And then I say, “I don’t want to accept *you*.” That means what? What do I mean? I already accept you. That’s why I say, “I don’t accept you.” Because already through my life [I accept], you know. 

And then I can see Bob. And then I see, “Oh, Bob. How are you?” When my feeling is good, I say, “How are you?” We shake hands. But I don’t feel good, I don’t want to shake his hand. So whatever I do, already – I like him or I don’t like him – is just like a bubble. Before that, I already accept him. 

So that’s why clear mirror is completely clear now.

**Questioner:** Okay, let me ask this in a different way. You completely accept everybody. To you, likes and dislikes are like little bubbles. That’s not the way they are to me. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Well, even though you say so, that is your life, anyway. That is for you. 

So what does it mean? What do you want to ask me?

*[Laughter.]*
