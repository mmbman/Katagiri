**Katagiri Roshi:** Page 101:

> “Good Knowing Advisors, my Dharma-door produces 84,000 wisdoms from the one Prajna. Why? Because worldly people have 84,000 kinds of defilement. In the absence of defilement, wisdom is always present, since it is not separate from the self-nature.
>
> “Understand that this dharma is just no-thought, no-remembrance, non-attachment, and the non-production of falsehood and error. Use your own true-suchness nature, and, by means of wisdom, contemplate and illuminate all dharmas without grasping or rejecting them. That is to see one’s own nature and realize the Buddha Way.
> 
> (From *The Sixth Patriarch’s Dharma Jewel Platform Sutra*, published and translated by the Buddhist Text Translation Society.)

Here it says, “To see one’s own nature and realize the Buddha Way.” I always [say], I think before, this sutra [talks] about this point, how important practice [is] for us, to see into ones own nature and realize the buddha way. He also mentions that is to see one’s own nature. So, “contemplate and illuminate all dharmas without grasping or rejecting them.” 

One more paragraph: 

> “Good Knowing Advisors, if you wish to enter the extremely deep Dharma realm and the Prajna samadhi, you must cultivate the practice of Prajna. Hold and recite The Diamond Prajna Sutra and that way you will see your own nature.”

I think here it [says] wisdom is always present since it is not separate from the self-nature. But, however, worldly people have 84,000 kinds of defilements. So, I think absent by the practice, or by the absense of 84,000 kinds of defilement, you can see this wisdom which is not separate from human body and mind, in other words, self-nature. So I think by practice you have to see into one’s own nature, which is not separate from the self, or being present always in everyone. That’s why here it says, [...] “Understand that this dharma is just no-thought, no-remembrance, non-attachment, and the non-production of falsehood and error.” This is characteristic of the dharma. 

And then, this is original nature of the self, and also original nature of the dharma. So we have to see into this nature. That is simultaneously to realize the buddha way. 

So what is the purpose of Buddhist practice? According to this sutra, I think in many place it always says that we have to see into one’s nature and realize the buddha way. That seems to be the purpose of Buddhist practice, Buddhist teaching, here it says. So that is questionable. 

Today I would like to say a little bit about this point. I think in *Shobogenzo* “Shizenbikku” “hosen bikkus”, I think Dogen Zenji [talks] about the misunderstanding of Zen practice, Buddhist practice, by many Zen monks in those days, quoting one of the Zen teachers’ statements. The Zen teacher mentions about the realization of the truth based on oneness of Confucianism and ... primitive teaching in China, there are three: Taoism, Confucianism, and one more. I forgot the Chinese words. One more, and also Buddhism. All three are saying. So one of the Zen teacher mentions the unity of four religions. And then each of religions in China they mention the purpose of its own practice. What is the purpose of Confucianism, what is the purpose of Taoism, what is the purpose of Buddhist practice. He mentions the purpose of Buddhist practice is to see into one’s own nature: he says this is the purpose of Buddhist practice. Then Dogen Zenji [says] that is a misunderstanding of Buddhism. 

And even though the Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch [talks] like this, ... do you remember, in the beginning, I think the Sixth Patriarch talks about this point. [...] Page 43:

> “The Great Master constantly exhorts the Sangha and laity only to uphold The Diamond Sutra. Then, they may see their own nature and straightaway achieve Buddhahood.”

Hmm. It’s not this one... 

*[Someone suggests page 47.]*

Page 47, at the top of the page:

> One day the Patriarch summoned his disciples together and said, “I have something to say to you: for people in the world, the matter of birth and death is a great one.’
>
> “All day long you seek fields of blessings only; you do not try to get out of the bitter sea of birth and death. If you are confused about your self-nature, how can blessings save you?”

So very naturally, you have to see your self nature, this is the purpose the Buddhist practice [talks about].

Then, I think in *Shobogenzo* there is a very interesting point in the “Scripture of Mountains and Waters.” I think I gave a *teisho* last year, [thinking] about this one. But on page 91, it is a very interesting point here. So let me read [it]:

> So it is that the total bringing forth of amassed qualities is made into form and name, into the lifeline. There is walking, there is flowing, there is a time when mountains give birth to mountain children. Because of the principle of mountains becoming buddhas and Zen adepts, buddhas and Zen adepts emerge and appear in this way. Even when we may have eyes for the manifestation of plants and trees, earth and stones, walls and fences, we are not in doubt, not disturbed. This is not total manifestation of being. Even though a time may manifest when it is seen as arrays of treasures, this is not the true ultimate. Even if various manifestation of being is seen as the realm of the buddhas, practice of the way, it is not necessarily something to love. Even if we attain the summit of seeing manifestation of being as inconceivable qualities of the buddhas, reality as it is is not only like this. Individual views of being are individual objects and subjects. This is not to say that they are to be considered the work on the way of buddhas and Zen adepts. They are limited views of one corner. 

So, first, Dogen Zenji mentions four views by many people. The first one, here it says, “When we may have eyes for the mountains and plants and trees, earth and stones, walls and fences, we are not in doubt, not disturbed. This is not total manifestation of being.”

First, is four kinds of misunderstanding of Buddhism. If you believe the purpose of Buddhism is to see into one’s self nature and realize the buddha way – it seems to be right, but it’s not alright, it’s a misunderstanding. 

So, four kinds of misunderstanding, mis-views. The first one is, he says like this, that is ... four kind of misunderstandings means for different persons. Like a first grade child, second grade child, third grade, and fourth grade, okay? According to Tendai teaching, Buddhist teaching is classified into the four kinds of doctrines. Do you remember the first one? Tripitaka Doctrine. And the second one is Shared Doctrine. And the third one is Distinctive Doctrine. And fourth is Complete Doctrine. Four kinds of doctrines, according to Tendai teaching. 

So, first grade children are like the person who follows Tripitaka. Are you familiar with the Tripitaka? Tripitaka is the whole system of the Buddha’s teaching, including sutra and shastra and precepts. Vinaya, and sutra, and shastra – those are called Tripitika. So, Tripitaka people, first grade children, think the world is nothing more than the manifestation of the plants and trees, earth and stones, walls and fences. So, the *saha* world; *saha* means worldly affairs. The human world, we call *saha* in Sanskrit. *Saha* means patience. 

So *saha* world is a defiling land. But on the other hand, the Lotus Sutra mentions “When all the living seen at the kalpa’s end, the conflagration when it is burning, tranquil is this realm of mind, even filled with heavenly beings,” et cetera. In other words, right in the middle of the burning of the world, there is a *saha* world where it is filled with heavenly beings. In other words, *saha* world is not peaceful world, but right in the middle of *saha* world, there is peace. Full of peace and harmony. So it’s a completely different statement. But those people believe the world is nothing more than the manifestation of the plants and trees and earth and stones, walls and fences, means lots of things in the human world, the *saha* world. Plants and trees, and earth and stones, walls and fences, and earthquakes and fires, volcanoes, et cetera. Many things. Wars, killing, pros and cons, success and failure. The world is completely filled with ugliness. So *saha* world is defiling land. 

But Dogen Zen [say] here, “But even though you see those people who [say] the world is a defiling land, that’s why we need a practice in order to see into ones own nature and realize the buddha way.” Even though you see those people, but don’t doubt the truth, we are buddha. Even the end, also he [says] here, we are not doubt, not disturbed. Don’t be confused. Even though you see those people who talk about this. Then many people doubt, or many people are very confused. But don’t do it, you know?

And “this is not the total manifestation of being.” Because that statement is not total manifestation of being. In other words, not talking about the total picture of what the human world is. It is just one corner. 

The second-grade child, who follows the Shared Doctrines. The Shared Doctrine means, according to Tendai, I think the *agamas*, and *Vimalakirti Sutra*, *Prajnaparamita Sutra*, et cetra. It’s very common doctrines, open to everyone. The shared doctrines. So that is like second grade children. Dogen Zenji says, “Even though a time may manifest when it is seen as an array of treasures, this is not the true ultimate.”

I think those who follow the Shared Doctrines, or second grade children, take a view of the world as treasures. So they believe the saha world is treasure. Because they see – what can I say – plants and trees, walls and fences, earthquakes and fires, starvation, whatever. We see all those events as a peace of our device, how to live peacefully. Because earthquake – we don’t like earthquakes, or fires, or starvations. But we can learn a lot from earthquakes and starvation, and misunderstandings and mistakes, you know, everyday life. We don’t like mistakes, but we cannot escape a mistake, and we cannot escape fires and earthquakes. So very naturally human beings create a culture of how to live in peace and harmony right in the middle of earthquake. So earthquake is not always bad. So they believe that we see earthquake or fire as the [...] advice how to live peacefully. 

In a sense, we see plants and trees as treasures. But that kind of understand depends on the individual viewpoint, because still there are dualistic – earthquake, and fires, and also self, here. The self sees walls and fences, earthquakes and fires, et cetera, and the first grade children say, “That is awful.” The second grade children say, “No, it’s not awful, it’s treasures. Because we grow, as human beings who know how to live in peace and harmony. So earthquake is what? It’s not wrong.”

But I think, that’s why many Buddhist scriptures mentions transforming the circumstance, transforming the objective situation into the inner world, inner life. Or, the purpose of practice is to transform absence of the mind into, well, realization of Buddhism, the buddha way. Or transforming delusion into nirvana. That is the purpose of Buddhism we [talk about]. But that is the second grade children’s viewpoint, because it is still dualistic. 

So that is the second point Dogen Zenji mentions here. 

#### 

The third: “Even if various manifestation of being is seen as the realm of the buddhas, practice of the way, it is not necessarily something to love.” This is the people who follow the Distinctive Doctrine, according to Tendai. 

In other words, how can I say: you know the story of the outlook of the world in India? They believe right in the middle of the universe there is Mount Sumeru. And at the top of Mount Sumeru is a place where [...] shakra, the gods live. Around this top of the mountain there are four corners; in each corner, gods as guardians live. And also around the bottom of the mountain, there are eight mountains, nine kinds of oceans. That is according to the stories of outlook on the world in India: primitive understanding. Mount Sumeru is just like the Himilaya Mountains. 

And at the bottom of Mount Sumeru is the saha world, toward the south. In that world is called jumbudaviva, where it is called saha world and where Buddha Shakyamyuni can stay and live. So in Jambuddhaviva, the saha world, the inhabitants in Jambuddhaviva cannot experience so much joyful and pleasure in life in comparison with other realms of the world toward the north, to the east and to the west. They are kind of heavenly world; they can enjoy very much, just like the heavenly world. But the saha world, so-called Jambuddhaviva, the inhabitants cannot experience full of joy, full of pleasure, et cetera, but they can experience dharma joy, because that is a place where the Buddha Shakyamuni can live. 

That always Buddhist scripture mentions. 

So in the universe, according to this story, there are sixteen big countries there, and also 500 middle size of nations there, and one hundred million small size of the world. Among them, there is Jambuddhaviva, so-called saha world. 

So from this point, saha world, our world, is the only place we can live, because Buddha lives. So saha world is not bad. 

So we love so much saha world, because there is no other way to live. But Dogen Zenji says, even though you believe like this, that place, Jambuddhaviva, is not altogether something to admire, to love. 

#### 

[...] The fourth: “Even if we attain the summit of seeing manifestation of being as inconceivable qualities of the buddhas, reality as it is is not only like this.” 

So fourth grade children, who follow the complete doctrine according to Tendai, which means Sadharmapundarika Sutra and Nirvana Sutra, et cetera. Anyway they believe that the saha world is the inconceivable merit of buddhas. 

Well, I think the Sadharma Pundarika Sutra mentions about this point. Because the saha world is a place where people can live, buddhas and ancestors, bodhisattvas, can live. That is the only one place where they can live. If so, the saha world is filled with inconceivable merits of buddhas and ancestors and bodhisattvas. In other words, the saha world is buddha’s world. 

So where you may go, you as a bohdisattva build up Buddha’s land. This is a point [which] many Buddhist scriptures mention about this. Do you know that? 

So we believe, “Yes, that’s it. That is a point we should believe as the purpose of Buddhist practice.” Wherever you may go, build up the truth. Even Dogen Zenji [talks about] this point. So what is the point of Dogen Zenji’s teaching? Dogen Zenji’s teaching, ancestors’ teaching, and Buddha’s teaching? It is to build up the truth wherever you may go – standing, walking, gassho, and zazen, eating breakfast, whatever you do, all you have to do is to build up the truth. It means, buddha land. Even though many people create wars, killing, and producing nuclear weapons, all you can do is to build up the truth, buddha’s land, day by day, from moment to moment, wherever you may go. Don’t be disappointed, because saha world is the buddha land.
