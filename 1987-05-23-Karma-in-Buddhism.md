[Are you] familiar with the term *karma*? I think this is a big subject; you have to consider it [for] your whole life. It’s a very important subject in order to find the solution of our problem of life-and-death: [the problem] related to whether the other world exists or not, [and] related with the present situation of human life, how we should live. So karma in Buddhism requires the very careful, serious research of human life for the long run. 

It’s very complicated. We don’t understand exactly what karma means. But Buddhist teaching gives us a certain hint, in order to know the overall picture of our life, related with past, present, future. I don’t think it’s necessary to get a definite answer what karma means. But I think you should get a certain hint, a certain feeling; [that] means a practical feeling, through your body and mind, through your everyday life. 

I think karma is quite different from the English term *fate* or *destiny*. Most people understand that karma [is kind of] like fate or destiny – not only Americans, but also Japanese people believe in that way. If you believe karma is fate or destiny, I think consciously or unconsciously you have kind of a divine entity as manipulator, who has your fate on a string. If you believe karma is fate, I think you fall into fatalism, so very naturally you become pessimistic. But karma is not exactly fate. I don’t think it is the same as fate or destiny. 

In Buddhism, *karma* means, practically, *to act*, *to work*, or *to do*. In Buddhism, *to do something* or *to act* is not only the mental act separate from the physical act. So if you say to *act*, I think it includes mental and physical act as one. That is the very common sense in Buddhism: you cannot separate them. So karma means to act, to work, or to do; that means [a] mental or physical act is going. 

I think in general Buddhism, there are two kinds of karma: one is non-individual karma, and the other one is individual karma. Individual karma is individual character. There is a certain character in everything, even the table, and the floor, and the microphone. There is a particular character in the microphone, which is different from the character in the table. So everything has individual karma, [not just] human beings. 

And non-individual karma means [karma that is] common to everyone. For instance, if you say *tree*, that is whatever kind of trees; all are trees. All of you are human beings, but you are American, not Japanese, so you have a certain karma, so-called American. So that is social or in terms of American customs or culture – I think all of you have almost the same kind of karma. 

So there are two different karmas in Buddhism generally, individual karma and non-individual karma. And those two karmas are produced by three kinds of activity: body – physical deeds; linguistic or language activity – words; and also mind – mental deeds. So physical deeds, and linguistic deeds, and also mental deeds. 

And then if you do something with the three categories of human deeds, then you can create your own life. So there are your physical deeds regarded as a cause, and then you can create your own life as a result. So very naturally, your deeds are produced in the stream of causation: cause and effect. 

So if you do something good, you will get a good result – this is a very natural and common understanding. And also, in Buddhism, I think there are three kinds of retribution – because the contents of causation is not so simple. [If you say], “If you do something good, you will get a good result” – it’s not so simple. Even though you do something good, you don’t get a good result. Even though you work hard, you are still poor. You may work hard to make money your whole life, but still be poor. So I think causation is not so simple [as] activity. But on the other hand, you cannot ignore the characteristic of causation, so-called “good cause brings good result.” So naturally, we consider three kinds of retribution: one is that if you do something good, that good cause will bring a good result in this life. The next is, maybe not in this life, but maybe next life. And then third, maybe not next life; good cause will bring good result in the life after next life. In other words, life after life. Life is constantly going, that’s why maybe the good cause will bring good result in the life after next life after next life – something like that. Very naturally Buddhism considers it in that way, because if you see human action based on causation, it teaches us how complicated it is; it’s not so simple. Dogen Zenji also talks about these three kinds of retribution. 

#### 

The question is, if you think karma in Buddhism generally like this – where is this karma? [In] what part of your life does karma exist? 

In the very beginning of Buddhism, I think it used a certain term, *yoni*, in Sanskrit – a kind of something stored in the womb. Or in *Abhidharmakosa*, I think they used the term *kalalam*, which means the first seven days after you become pregnant, and also *arbudam*, which is the second seven days after you become pregnant. *Abhidharmakosa* is very old Buddhist psychology, researching how you produce your life, include past, present, and future; twenty-five hundred years ago, Buddhists tried to understand human life like this. So in the *Abhidharmakosa*, I think karma is [like] continuous energy, *somewhere* in human life. It’s still a little bit vague, but [according to] *Abhidharmakosa*, maybe the first seven days there is a certain energy there – a very basic, continuous stream of human energy there – prior to your contemplation, prior to your human agency. Or maybe the second seven days. Something like that. 

And then Buddhism developed more, and in Mahayana Buddhism then we have the Buddhist psychology called *Vijnanavada*, which means *merely consciousness*. (*Vijnanavada* is also known as *Yogachara*.) In this Buddhist psychology I think they use a certain term, *[unintelligible,]* which means *unmanifested* karma. Or they say *unmanifested matter* or *[unmanifested] form*. 

So according to this term *unmanifested karma*, I think they thought [of] a kind of potential power in human life. Like in Western psychology, Jung or Freud, they are talking about a kind of potential power, potential consciousness, something like that. But potential consciousness – where does the power belong to? The mental aspect of human life or the physical aspect of human life? Even though you believe the potential power belongs to conscious aspect of human life, still the conscious world is classified by the two, unconscious or conscious. So we are thinking – where is the karma, where is the potential power there? But in Buddhism, we don’t separate it. Body and mind work together. So Buddhism doesn’t talk about where the potential power belongs to. 

Anyway, Buddhism thinks about a certain kind of potential power in human life. Another term in Mahayana Buddhism is *alayavijnana*. [There are] eight consciousness, and then the last consciousness is called alayavijnana. Alayavijnana has another name, *karma-vipaka*: that means kind of a storehouse of various heterogeneous acts, which you have accumulated for a long time. Can you feel that? That is alayavijnana. We have consciousness, but eight kinds of consciousness, and the last one is called alayavijnana, which means “big storehouse” – a huge storehouse of various different human acts, which you have accumulated – for a long, long time, so it’s a huge storage there. That is your life, okay? 

But this consciousness, this term also teaches us there is a certain potential power, but that it belongs to not just human life but also everything. Alayavijnana is very universal. Even the desks and tables, floors, trees, all have alayavijnana. It’s very interesting... this is Buddhist psychology. So it’s very basic consciousness; deep consciousness. More than the unconscious or conscious meaning. 

From this point, I think Buddhism developed more kinds of ... the *Avatamsaka Sutra*. In the Avatamsaka Sutra, which is very clear, definite explanation of how the human world is going, that is Avatamsaka Sutra. It has already been translated into English, so you can read it, but you don’t understand it, because this huge world is represented by Buddhas and many bodhisattvas, so it’s very complicated – philosophy and psychology there. But in this sutra, I think karma is accepted not the mental or physical potential power, but it includes... it is a kind of energy in the realm the interdependent co-origination, in the stream of interdependent co-origination. That means everything is produced by conditioned elements, many conditioned elements. So before you think or you don’t think, there is a certain energetic stream, always creating. By what? By conditioned elements. That is completely beyond your control. So that, if you see very deeply the structure of the human world, human life, you can see that philosophical background of human existence. This teaching is called interdependent co-origination. It’s very deep Buddhist philosophy. 

But anyway, karma is working the realm of interdependent co-origination. So a little bit, karma is not only belong to human life or particular beings, but it belongs to the depths of general existence, cosmic existence. So the idea of karma is accepted in broader perspective. Alright? This is in Mahayana Buddhism.

#### 

So very naturally, I think if you study Buddhism in order to research karma is, but still it’s very vague. So I would like to say a little bit paying attention to human life which you are taking care of day to day. How do we accept karma? 

But first of all, I think you should understand ... you use always [the word] personality. What is a personality? Personality is a sort of very simple entity including its multitudinous nature. Such as emotion, will, volition ... not only the intellect. The intellect, emotion, and volition or will. Or, very deep feeling, very profound feeling, a profound meaning which ... The intellect, emotion, and volition work together. That is very deep, profound feeling. We say the five skandhas or aggregates of form, feeling, perception, impulses, consciousness. The second one, feeling, is very deep, profound first stage of human emotion, the very first – before you poke your head into it. So that is very deep feeling. The moment when you face or see your object, the image of your object is accepted by the first stage of your emotional intellectual function. That is called *feeling*. So that is very deep. 

Or, custom, habit, and also character, individual character. Or heredity. And also memories. What is personality? You say personality simply, but what is personality? Working in your everyday life in a very complicated way. Because it includes many things.

So from this point, what is your everyday life? You always understand who you are, who they are. You evaluate yourself, you are critical toward others, towards the present situation, by which you always create anger, hatred, fighting and many things. What is your understanding? What is your place in life? How do you understand it? 

And then, even though you don’t evaluate, you don’t think, you don’t criticize people, but still you always give rise to a certain “smell” from your body and mind. Can’t you believe [that]? *[He laughs.]* Even though I sit down here without saying [anything], you can smell a certain [...] from me. So even though you don’t judge, you don’t criticize, or you are very nice, or not good, or whatever you say... if you just sit down here, and then, something speaks of you. What is it? This is called personality, whole personality. 

What is whole personality? What is it structured by? That’s why I mentioned those things: emotions, and will, and also oneness of emotions and intellect and volition, et cetera. And also customs, habits, and characteristics. And also heredity, and also memories. Memories come from your beginingless past; lots of memories you have. Some memories come up in the present, but that is just a little bit of your memories. But if you sit down, what kind of memories come up? You are surprised to see that. 

So from this point, I can say like this: First of all, by your intellect you other’s life, and you judge yourself and others and the world, et cetera. But that intellectual understanding is just a speck of dust of your whole personality. It’s not perfect. But a problem is, intellect fully believes that your understanding is perfect. That is a characteristic of your intellectual habits. Do you understand? That’s why we so much love the world which is clear and neat. We don’t want the dark aspect of the human world. So we don’t want to have what we don’t understand. So we try to understand everything. So we always ignore the back. The back is something you don’t understand. Back means space. Space ... well I can always say, what is space? Space is the front; this is also space, which is clear, understandable, reasonable. This is space in front, this is the intellectual world, alright? Created by science. And behind, that space is very dark. You don’t understand it. But you cannot ignore it. You have to always carry it on your back. What is the past? What is heredity? We don’t know. What is the religion, dealing with life and death? In the past, in the future... we don’t know what it is. So that is the space behind. To that space, to the right, to the left, this is human relation, okay? This is also space. That space is also really taken care of by human relation, working hand in hand, under all circumstances. This is taking care of space. And also, space underneath. This is everyday life: rooted in the earth. That is completely beyond wise or not wise. Everyone has to be rooted in everyday life. That is another space. 

One more space is above the head. Above the head is something mysterious. But it helps us so much. When you are really confused. So when you are confused, you always pray. To where? You say God, but where is God? You always look up to the sky, don’t you think so? So space above is wonderful: clear, vast openness. 

So even though you say space – what is space? Not philosophical term, but practically, what is space? Front, back, behind, to the right, to the left, beneath, and above. Those space should be understood. But intellectual understanding is very narrow. But a problem is that intellectual understanding fully believes that it is perfect understanding, but that is just a speck of dust. You always love the front; that’s it. You don’t reflect upon, you don’t accept with compassion relationship among human beings. If you ignore this one, you never exist in peace and harmony. So if you want to live in peace and harmony, you have to take many kinds of space: front, behind, to the right, to the left, above, beneath. 

But this is a fact that we have intellectual understanding. So from now on, what we have to do is to train our intellectual patterns which you have had. In other words, a little bit change. Change means patting the head and [saying], *[he laughs,]* “Okay, you are good – but wait a minute. I will tell you something.” A little more broad aspect of human life which you don’t know. I think you shouldn’t hit or throw it away; no, you should take care of it. That means change. 

So from now on, what you have to do is practice a changing of the usual pattern of intellectual understanding, intellectual system. Alright? 

#### 39:03

Another one is, intellectual understanding always fully believes that there is nothing when you die. Your skin, muscle, bones and marrow are ... blown out. *(Transcriber’s note: like a candle.)* Including consciousness: all gone. So intellectual understanding always fully believes that death takes away everything; nothing left. Including the other world. But – is that true? We have to think of it. 

So this is pretty good practice for us. The first one is you should train the usual pattern of your intellectual system which you have had. Second, I think intellectual understanding always believes there is nothing left after your death – but is it true, or not? 

If you try to believe in that way of intellectual understanding, but you don’t satisfy, even though intellectual understanding fully believes that there is nothing left behind your death. But still you aren’t satisfied. So finally what you have to do is chase after your own tail, just like a cat. That is the intellectual world. *[He laughs.]* Playing a game. Do you know the see-saw? Or chasing after your own tail, playing with your own tail. That is the intellectual world. 

But if you understand your whole personality, I think you should understand something more than the intellectual world – including many things, as I already said. So *how*? Let’s make your mind calm; calm your body and mind, and then practically, touch the depth of your whole personality, something more than the intellectual world. How do you touch something more than the intellectual world? That is the experience of practical feeling of your life, touched by deep meditation. Make your mind and body calm; and then you can go deeply into something more than the intellectual. Because you have to understand the whole personality, not only your life, but also others’ lives, and also trees, birds. You cannot understand trees separate from the sky and seasons, so you have to understand the whole personality of the trees, birds, mountains. That’s why Dogen Zenji says that the mountain is not only the mountain: mountain should be understood as the mountains, and also Buddhas and ancestors. That means cosmic trees and birds. At that time, that understanding is touching to the intellectual world, and also something more than the intellectual world. But we don’t believe this one. We always understand, “Oh, that is a tree, I understand it. I know that.” But we never know. 

Second is, even though you find the solution for the life and death problem, saying there is the other world, it’s not enough. Because it’s not a final solution – because nobody proves whether the other world exists or not. Through a book or something, through philosophy, through religion, through the words of wise people, et cetera, we believe in that way, but there is no practical proof ...

... Through this practical death, what can I feel, practically? *[He laughs.]* I want to scream, practically. Because there’s nothing left. Because after death I don’t know. Even though I don’t know what death is, if I participate in death actually, I don’t know what death is. Because I am already death. Do you understand? There is no I, right in the middle of real death. So if I die, actually *nothing* left. Why we have to believe in this situation of life and death, why we have to believe in something. But what is awareness? Why is it necessary for us to be aware? If it is necessary, what do you mean by awareness? That is the question. Because even though *I* experience enlightenment, *[he laughs,]* when I die, all enlightenment I have experienced is gone. And Zen Center and people all gone from before me. Then finally I’m always thinking I want to be haunting over the Zen center. *[People laugh, and he laughs with them.]* After my death, watching over all of you, and how you fill Zen Center, how you are taking care of Zen Center, how you feel [about] Katagiri, what he has done. Do you want to criticize Katagiri, or do respect him? *[Laughter.]* If you don’t respect me, I want to haunt you! *[He laughs.]* I always feel in that way. *[He laughs some more.]* Watch out! 

Why is it necessary to be aware of? What is it? Don’t you think this is questionable. Finally, what you hav e to do is what? Research awareness? Yes, it is. But day-to-day life, what is it? What do you have to do? You should believe in something? Yes, it is. But what is the most important thing you have to do? Not only that you have to do in the realm of the intellectual world, you have to do in the vast expanse of the world, something more than the intellectual world, that’s what I want to say. What you have to do. 

Is that okay? Do you have a question? 

#### 27:14

**Question**: Hojo-san, there are so many references in traditional practice to evil karma. And when you talk, you’re talking about something much more basic, about acts and deeds that just are, and it’s very much broader than ...  It’s there at the very end of ... the last thing you said, I thought there was something, when you came back to talk about karma, you said maybe it’s not so good, or something like that. Where is that coming right now? 

**Katagiri**: Well, not something good of your life which you have understood is just the picture of your life through the intellectual world. Don’t you think so? But the overall picture of your life in the dispassionate and imperturbable perspective. What is life? That life is understood only by the intellectual? No; by something more than intellectual. So I think karma is not only the bad. But if you say, “I have bad karma,” that means simultaneously you have good karma too. That is the overall picture of karma you use. So what is karma? *[He laughs.]* So finally you don’t know. Karma is bad, or karma is good? Karma is neutral? No. It’s vast. 

I don’t know what karma is; but practically I can feel it, deeply. Something about karma extending into the past, present, future. 

#### 29:23

**Question**: I guess I don’t really understand how there can be ... I understand how there can be an individual karma and a non-individual karma, but I ... more about how non-individual karma can apply to a certain group, like a Japanese karma, or an American karma, or a Brazilian karma. I don’t understand how there can be a non-individual karma that applies to a group, rather than to all things. 

**Katagiri**: Excuse me, I’m not clear. 

**Another person**: I understand the question, but I’m looking at it more personally, I’m wondering, do you ever wonder why you’re here with us? 

**Katagiri**: *[Cackles.]*

**Same person**: And why it’s us, this group here, and not somebody else? You know? 

**Another person**: Sometimes I look around at our group and I think, there’s nobody really super-exceptional here, we’re all kind of average people, but what are we doing here? You know, with this Japanese teacher. Because I think we have a particular American karma, we have American history and world view, and yours is quite different. 

**Katagiri**: Yes, I am different, so-called Japanese. But on the other hand, I think the individual karma is not separate from non-individual karma. Individual karma cannot be developed in the vast expanse of the human world, so-called non-individual world. Otherwise, individual karma cannot be developed. In other words, if you ignore society, nations ... in other words, if you ignore belonging to or participating in nations and society, you can develop your own character, but it really develops based on ego. So in order to develop individual different character, I think it must develop in broader perspective – in other words, by belonging to or participating in peoples, groups, and also society, nations. And then, your personality develops very in a very gentle, humble way. Do you understand? 

That’s why I mentioned a couple years ago to the Zen Center in San Francisco. They don’t want to look at the Japanese custom of Zen Buddhism, so they try to escape or ignore. And then they want to develop their own Buddhism. Yes, it is! But I say, if you want to [have an] American way of Buddhism, developing naturally, I think you should pay attention to American Buddhism connected not only to American situation but also all cosmic situation, including Japan, and Europe. How can you understand America separate from Europe and the East? No way. But nevertheless, you have to develop your own character. How do you develop your own character? Humbly.

The American spirit is very, what would you say, energetic. Yes, I understand. But I think you should develop that energetic American spirit *humbly*, in a humble way, not an egoistical way. Do you understand what I mean? 

That’s why I can live here, and also I can teach Buddha’s teaching, beyond races and beyond culture. I have to teach this, I have to talk about this. If I always talk about [the Japanese way], you don’t want to practice, [and then] I cannot exist here. But I am different from you. But I am exactly I, who is different, but who is exactly penetrating in the universal understanding. Okay? Then, we can work together. That’s why I can develop my own different personality – in a humble way. 

It means, we have to practice humbleness. We have to practice humility.

Well, Americans don’t like the Japanese way, or the other way, I understand this. But pat your head, anyway. *[Soft laughter.]* That is your intellectual understanding, but the world is something more than that. That’s what I always [talk about]. 

For instance, if you live together with someone, for instance boyfriend or girlfriend, how do you live, how do you develop your personality? It’s no so simple. I don’t care you, but I want to live with you. How do live in peace? You have to be married, next moment you have to divorce. If you really become egoistic, you know. So we have to develop taking care of human life in a humble way. 

**Same person**: I’m not sure my question was clear. I guess what I meant was that it seems sufficient that there should be a global karma, a cosmic karma, rather than one that adheres to certain groups. But maybe as there is a karma that applies specifically to, say, Japanese culture, or to American culture, there’s one that applies to individuals...

**Katagiri**: Yes. 

**Same person**: ... and that they depend on the whole. So there can be a global karma...

**Katagiri**: Yes, that’s right. So, it’s very complicated. All things seem [to be] interconnected, so that is a very simple entities which you can see, practically. But the contents of the simple entity is very complicated, consisting of many situations. The cosmic state of existence is very complicated. Individual character of the nation, but also common character of humans. Wherever you are, American, or Japanese, or European, you are human beings. If so, if you say human beings, human beings have really something stinky. And also peaceful being. So that is very common.

But you are American, which is different from others, but on the other hand, you are human, which is the same as I. So that’s why total overall picture of cosmic or global, whatever you say, it consists of many, many things. But practically, we have to take care of that overall picture of global existence. That’s why we have to be careful.

For instance, we are creating nuclear weapons, and all beings might be destroyed. Who creates this? Particular races? No. That is human beings. That is really global character of human beings. But, should we ignore the individual different characters? Where should we find the different characters? We should find different individual characters in that global character, which all human beings possess. What is this? There is the example of creating nuclear weapons. Should we destroy individual character? No. We have to develop individual different characters in that global character of human being. *How?* That’s why [it’s] difficult. But we shouldn’t ignore it. So we have to develop individual character, and simultaneously the global character of human beings. Beyond any ideas – whether we can build up a peaceful world or not; beyond this, let’s do it – be peaceful. That’s why Thich Nhat Hanh says, “Breathing in, I calm my body and mind. Breathing out, I smile with joy.” What is this practice? What does he mean? No discussion... but still, discussion there. But I think sooner or later you have to stop discussing and then day by day you have to build up peace in the very complicated overall picture of global existence, so-called human beings. This is our peaceful work, our peace work, [religiously speaking.]
