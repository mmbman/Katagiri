*An unsurpassed, penetrating and perfect dharma*

For today, I would like to explain, one by one, the Ten Prohibitory Precepts. 

I think the Ten Great Prohibitory Precepts mean to actualize the embodiment of living in vow, which corresponds to the Three Collective Precepts. The precept of all Buddha’s laws and rules. Collective, wholesome dharma. Collective, inconceivable activity for all beings. 

So devoting yourself fully to the Triple Treasure is the Buddhist faith. Using your mind and consciousness, you should devote yourself to the Triple Treasure, regardless of whether you understand or not. Anyway, all you have to do is to move in the deep course of the Triple Treasure. This is the faith. 

And then, faith is one of the Precepts. So precept, I told you last time, is to form a habit of a way of living based on Buddha’s teaching. Constantly, every day, you have to form a habit, a custom. This is a precept. So the Triple Treasure: If you want to now what faith is, you have to form a habit of a way of living based on Buddha’s teaching. This is called faith. So every day you have to do it like this. And then, if you have Buddhist faith, next you have to receive the Three Collective Pure Precepts, which means the Buddhist vow, because for habit is not the same meaning as addiction or usual habit, which may last only for your lifetime. But if you want to practice spiritual life, you have to maintain your habit for the long run, life after life. Beyond time [and] space. 

So, that habit continually forever, forming a habit of a way of living based on Buddha’s teaching is called vow. So vow is continually going, in the realm of eternity, beyond time and space. So life after life. And also, vow is no sense of self-attachment. No desire, no individual interest. But habit in the usual sense has self attachment and object attachment, or individual desires, interest. Always they are involved in a sense of the usual habit. But a vow doesn’t have [that].

And now, this vow, we have to put this vow into practice in our everyday life. This is the Ten Prohibitory Precepts.

#### 7:57

The first: abstain from taking life. 

The commentary says: 

> Not taking life facilitates the growth of the Buddha seed. We should succeed to the wisdom life vein of the Buddha. Do not take life.

So I mentioned before, precept is Buddha Nature. And a few minutes ago I mentioned in terms of terminology, precept or sila in Sanskrit means to form a habit. But on the other hand, the deep meaning of the precept, it is Buddha Nature, the truth. Or we can say, all myriad dharmas themselves are ultimate reality. Or, we say Truth, with a capital T. 

So receive the precepts, to receive the precept is to awaken to the Buddha nature. Even though you don’t understand what the Buddha Nature or what the Truth is. To receive is awareness. In other words, if you don’t understand the value of the diamond, but anyway somebody gives it to you and [you] receive the diamond in your hand, that is already awareness of the value of diamond. But it doesn’t hit your consciousness. But more-or-less it hits to your life, in many ways. To receive the Precepts is awareness of Buddha Nature. That’s why to receive the Precepts is important. So that’s why during the ceremony we say, “Do you observe the precept?” We say, “Yes, I will!” Then, “Yes, I will” really makes sense. 

Because we always try to receive something in terms of intellectual sense, in terms of individual level and individual knowledge, individual education, individual degree of understanding yourself and others. And then, you can receive or you don’t want to receive. That’s event happens. But in spiritual life, I think regardless of whether you understand or not, anyway to receive the Precepts means to receive Buddha Nature, truth. Because you have to help grow the true nature, the Buddha Nature, the Truth. 

So again and again you have to receive diamond. Even though you don’t understand what it is, somebody gives it to you. Then receive, receive, every day receive it. And then that practice helps grow the seed of true nature. 

So from this point, practice is simple. But your consciousness is always *grumbling*. Making complaints, always. That’s why the apparent life becomes very complicated. And also because life is apparently life is tossed away by consciousness, the conscious world. That’s it. But actually, if you want to develop your spiritual life, it’s a very simple life. Regardless of whether you understand or not, totally you should receive the diamond as it is. And then, this practice helps grow the seed of Buddha Nature.

So, the Ten Grave Prohibitory Precepts are to demonstrate or to actualize the embodiment of living in vow. 

In the commentary, there are a few difficult terms there. “To facilitate the growth of Buddha’s seed” – to facilitate, and not taking life, and also Buddha’s seeds. And also “wisdom life-vein of Buddha”. Those terms are a little bit complicated. Not complicated; we are not familiar with them. Even though you study Buddhism, we are not familiar with it, we don’t understand this one. 

“Facilitate growth”; what is the meaning of facilitating the growth? What is the meaning of the Buddha seed? How can you facilitate the growth of Buddha’s seed? Where? How? And then, what is the wisdom life vein of Buddha? What is it? How can we maintain the wisdom life vein of Buddha forever? How? Lots of questions come up. 

... and also, those terms, what do those terms relate with the meaning of not taking life? What do we mean? So lots of questions come up. 

But first of all, we have to understand the Buddha’s world. What is the Buddha’s world? What is the Truth? I don’t want to explain the truth of Buddha’s world, but I think you can a little bit touch what the Buddha’s world is, what the truth is we are talking about. And then in the Buddha’s world, we have to form continually a habit of this precept. Not in the dualistic world. So first of all, what is the Buddha’s world?

Not taking life means, usually we say, don’t take life. It means life is here, and then in the future, life will be gone, or life will be extinguished. So “don’t take life” means immediately we think life is extinguished, or life is gone. But really strictly speaking, you never understand the real reality that life is extinguished. You never understand real reality of life and death. No, you don’t. But we have to – not understand it, we have to taste it, through the practice. That’s why [it’s] a little difficult. We don’t understand it, but we have to taste it, we have to touch that core of the meaning of life itself and death itself. So let’s say life is going to death, and then that is called
