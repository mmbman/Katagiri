(*Transcriber’s Note*: The group chants the Sutra-Opening Verse in Japanese and English. This appears to be the *Kaikyō ge*, but the Japanese words are different from online sources.)

*An unsurpassed, penetrating and perfect dharma*  
*Is rarely met with even in a hundred thousand million kalpas*  
*Having it to see and listen to, remember and accept*  
*I vow to taste the truth of the Tathagatha’s words.*

For today, I would like to explain, one by one, the Ten Prohibitory Precepts. 

I think the Ten Great Prohibitory Precepts mean to actualize the embodiment of living in vow, which corresponds to the Three Collective Precepts. The precept of all Buddha’s laws and rules. Collective, wholesome dharma. Collective, inconceivable activity for all beings. 

So devoting yourself fully to the Triple Treasure is the Buddhist faith. Using your mind and consciousness, you should devote yourself to the Triple Treasure, regardless of whether you understand or not. Anyway, all you have to do is to move in the deep course of the Triple Treasure. This is the faith. 

And then, faith is one of the Precepts. So precept, I told you last time, is to form a habit of a way of living based on Buddha’s teaching. Constantly, every day, you have to form a habit, a custom. This is a precept. So the Triple Treasure: If you want to now what faith is, you have to form a habit of a way of living based on Buddha’s teaching. This is called faith. So every day you have to do it like this. And then, if you have Buddhist faith, next you have to receive the Three Collective Pure Precepts, which means the Buddhist vow, because for habit is not the same meaning as addiction or usual habit, which may last only for your lifetime. But if you want to practice spiritual life, you have to maintain your habit for the long run, life after life. Beyond time [and] space. 

So, that habit continually forever, forming a habit of a way of living based on Buddha’s teaching is called vow. So vow is continually going, in the realm of eternity, beyond time and space. So life after life. And also, vow is no sense of self-attachment. No desire, no individual interest. But habit in the usual sense has self attachment and object attachment, or individual desires, interest. Always they are involved in a sense of the usual habit. But a vow doesn’t have [that].

And now, this vow, we have to put this vow into practice in our everyday life. This is the Ten Prohibitory Precepts.

#### 7:57

The first: abstain from taking life. 

The commentary says: 

> Not taking life facilitates the growth of the Buddha seed. We should succeed to the wisdom life vein of the Buddha. Do not take life.

So I mentioned before, precept is Buddha Nature. And a few minutes ago I mentioned in terms of terminology, precept or sila in Sanskrit means to form a habit. But on the other hand, the deep meaning of the precept, it is Buddha Nature, the truth. Or we can say, all myriad dharmas themselves are ultimate reality. Or, we say Truth, with a capital T. 

So receive the precepts, to receive the precept is to awaken to the Buddha nature. Even though you don’t understand what the Buddha Nature or what the Truth is. To receive is awareness. In other words, if you don’t understand the value of the diamond, but anyway somebody gives it to you and [you] receive the diamond in your hand, that is already awareness of the value of diamond. But it doesn’t hit your consciousness. But more-or-less it hits to your life, in many ways. To receive the Precepts is awareness of Buddha Nature. That’s why to receive the Precepts is important. So that’s why during the ceremony we say, “Do you observe the precept?” We say, “Yes, I will!” Then, “Yes, I will” really makes sense. 

Because we always try to receive something in terms of intellectual sense, in terms of individual level and individual knowledge, individual education, individual degree of understanding yourself and others. And then, you can receive or you don’t want to receive. That’s event happens. But in spiritual life, I think regardless of whether you understand or not, anyway to receive the Precepts means to receive Buddha Nature, truth. Because you have to help grow the true nature, the Buddha Nature, the Truth. 

So again and again you have to receive diamond. Even though you don’t understand what it is, somebody gives it to you. Then receive, receive, every day receive it. And then that practice helps grow the seed of true nature. 

So from this point, practice is simple. But your consciousness is always *grumbling*. Making complaints, always. That’s why the apparent life becomes very complicated. And also because life is apparently life is tossed away by consciousness, the conscious world. That’s it. But actually, if you want to develop your spiritual life, it’s a very simple life. Regardless of whether you understand or not, totally you should receive the diamond as it is. And then, this practice helps grow the seed of Buddha Nature. 

#### 13:56

So, the Ten Grave Prohibitory Precepts are to demonstrate or to actualize the embodiment of living in vow. 

In the commentary, there are a few difficult terms there. “To facilitate the growth of Buddha’s seed” – to facilitate, and not taking life, and also Buddha’s seeds. And also “wisdom life-vein of Buddha”. Those terms are a little bit complicated. Not complicated; we are not familiar with them. Even though you study Buddhism, we are not familiar with it, we don’t understand this one. 

“Facilitate growth”; what is the meaning of facilitating the growth? What is the meaning of the Buddha seed? How can you facilitate the growth of Buddha’s seed? Where? How? And then, what is the wisdom life vein of Buddha? What is it? How can we maintain the wisdom life vein of Buddha forever? How? Lots of questions come up. 

... and also, those terms, what do those terms relate with the meaning of not taking life? What do we mean? So lots of questions come up. 

#### 

But first of all, we have to understand the Buddha’s world. What is the Buddha’s world? What is the Truth? I don’t want to explain the truth of Buddha’s world, but I think you can a little bit touch what the Buddha’s world is, what the truth is we are talking about. And then in the Buddha’s world, we have to form continually a habit of this precept. Not in the dualistic world. So first of all, what is the Buddha’s world?

Not taking life means, usually we say, don’t take life. It means life is here, and then in the future, life will be gone, or life will be extinguished. So “don’t take life” means immediately we think life is extinguished, or life is gone. But really strictly speaking, you never understand the real reality that life is extinguished. You never understand real reality of life and death. No, you don’t. But we have to – not understand it, we have to taste it, through the practice. That’s why [it’s] a little difficult. We don’t understand it, but we have to taste it, we have to touch that core of the meaning of life itself and death itself. So let’s say life is going to death, and then that is called “I understand the meaning of life and death.” So at that time you think a certain imaginary world that life is extinguished, or life is being extinguished, or life is being gone. And then we say we understand it. For instance, someone dies, Katagiri dies in minutes, and then we say, “Oh, Katagiri died.” People say, “We understand it. Katagiri – died.” But we seem to understand that reality which life is being gone. But – I want to ask you, do you understand the real reality which the life is *lifing*? Or death is dying? Or extinction is being extinguished? Do you understand this real reality? 

In other words, extinction itself, life itself. Nothing compare with life; there is nothing. If you say “life,” you have to understand life as it is. At that time, do you understand life itself, which is called “life is lifing?” 

For instance, when you awaken from sleep, can you understand the real reality that awakening is awakening? Do you? But you say, “I understand awakening” means here is a partition, a very thin partition. The left side is *A*, and the right side is *B*, okay? Let’s imagine this. And then *A* is the sleeping world, the sphere of sleeping. And then the sleeping goes through this partition and enters the *B* world, so called awakening. So you say, “I awake from the sleep.” Then, what do you mean “awakening”? What kind of awakening do you understand? Is that clear? Which kind of awakening do you understand? Please tell me. Which is A and B, what kind of awakening do you understand? Can you say? 

**Question**: The transition from one to the other?

**Katagiri**: Yes. Transition – but what do you mean, transition? *[He laughs.]* Transition is questionable too. You know, awakening is not transitioning, well maybe transitioning, but result of awakening, in other words effect of awakening. Is that clear? 

In other words, the ideal of awakening you understand is just an idea, so-called *A* and *B*. Real awakening, before or after awakening, real awakening itself. But real awakening, you don’t know, because real awakening is this partition. You have to pass through this. That is this partition. Temporarily I say partition, but this partition means awakening is awakening. This partition is a word which awakening is awakening, constantly. This is called moment. Okay?

But in the moment, you say this moment is still idea of moment, idea of time, you can catch it. But 2500 years ago, already Buddha said, Abhidharma mentions about the very shortest moment, the shortest period of time, so called 1/75th of a moment, or 1/60th of a moment. Let’s see the world at the sphere of 1/60th or 1/75th of a moment. At that time, are *A* and *B* seperated? No. I don’t think *A* and *B* are separated. They become very close. Where? In the moment. In the sphere of this partition, so-called 1/75th of a moment. At that time, *A* and *B* go very fast, at superspeed. At that time, we don’t know what *A* is. So if you say *A*, immediately it’s *B*. If you say *B*, it’s immediately *A*. That is *A* and *B* working together in the sphere of the 1/75th of a moment. 

So from this point, how do we know? How do we know, intellectually, or with your consciousness? But we have to taste it, because we are always going through this world. Because we are always living from moment to moment. So life is quick, very quick. Now I am talking; next moment, probably, I may die. Very quick. So at that time in the conscious world, we always in before or after this, the sphere of the 1/7th of a moment. So no way to understand. But we have to understand it. 

So in this partition, I think we can say awakening is awakening. Katagiri is Katagiri-ing. Sitting is sitting. That’s it. Talking is talking; zazen is just zazen, that’s it. Awakening is just awakening; how can I say? Katagiri awake? No. Katagiri *does* zazen: it’s already dualistic. 

So what kind of zazen do you understand? Always the idea of zazen, you understand. Before or after, do you understand that one? You always understand zazen, or Katagiri, or you yourself, always. What kind of world do you live? What kind of things do you understand? Always idea. Always conceptual world. In other words, before and after the sphere of the 1/75th of the moment, that’s it. This is called the conceptual world, or idealistical world. So we always ignore that most important world we pass through. 

That’s why Dogen Zenji mentions a pine tree transmits pine tree. Buddha knows Buddha. Only Buddha knows what the Buddha is. This kind of expression coming it. Who knows Katagiri? Who knows enlightenment? Who knows what real Katagiri is? Katagiri knows Katagiris. Katagiri transmits Katagiri; [that] means, where the responsibility? Where is the teaching? So teaching and responsibility, all are right here. What is the meaning of awakening? What is the meaning of understanding of awakening? Where is it? It is right in the midst of the real reality which awakening is awakening, life is life-ing, death is dying. So in that world, there is no room to conceptualize, because it is nothing but practice in dynamism. That’s why in Shobogenzo, total dynamic working. He says life is the manifestation of total dynamic working. Death is the full manifestation of total dynamic working. That’s it. So what do you mean, to die? Please die; that’s it. Even though you scream, even though you say “I am happy to die,” it doesn’t hit the mark. Cry, scream, or whatever you say, there is within the screaming, within your feeling, within your experience, there is no responsibility, nothing to do for you. What your real responsibility is, right in the midst of the real reality which death is dying; that’s all. It’s very simple. But it’s too simple to be hard, because consciousness doesn’t want to accept, doesn’t want to know what it is. Because consciousness get’s use of being with the conscious world. Conscious world, so-called before and after the sphere which life is life-ing, death is dying. 

So that moment, that world is called Truth. It is called the truth, it is called the Buddha’s world, because we don’t know what it is. But we are there. Our life is completely embraced by this. Or we are present from moment to moment right there. That is called Buddha, Buddha’s world, or Buddha Nature. That truth is not something objective. It is the original nature of the self. 

So the original nature of the self is not something different from the truth. Truth and the original nature of the self are one. Because it’s very close, very close. 

#### 33:47

So that is the Buddha’s world, okay? Then let’s see the *facilitate the growth*. Facilitate the growth means real facilitation of growth is where? In the conceptual world? What is the source of energy which helps grow, or what is the source of the sphere where everything is facilitating the growth? Where is it? In the conceptual world? Or *A* world, or *B* world? Where is it? 

Tell me. Tomorrow, or yesterday? Where is it?

**Student**: It’s wherever it is. 

**Katagiri**: Yes it is. Before you the name on where we are. Okay? Because where we are is where-ing we are. *[He laughs.]* It’s just we are going, so there is no room to say something. So it is constantly dynamic working, that’s why Dogen Zenji mentions life is the full manifestation of total dynamic working. So no room to conceptualize; just working. And then, if you want to taste this, it is practice. We have to be right on, be right there, right present there. We have to be right in harmony with. At that time, what is this? It’s not discussion; [it’s] practice in motion. Just, you have to do it.

So that is the source of facilitation of the growth. Source. And also, from that source of facilitation of growth, then there is a Buddha seed. Because that source of helping the growth, facilitating the growth, is seed of Buddha, source of your energy, so-called life. So there is a seed. If you are there, very naturally a seed grows. 

And also there is a Buddha seed. And also he said, succeed to the wisdom life vein of the Buddha. But wisdom life vein of the Buddha means that source of facilitating the growth is ... I think, maybe 1/75th of a moment, we can say, or truth, we can say. Or we can say Buddha Nature. But it is not idea of 1/75th of moment; more than that. It is not but energy in dynamism, energy in motion. And also it is going eternally, regardless of whether world is born or not, it’s going, constantly. That’s why is called wisdom life vein of Buddha. It’s going constantly. 

So, you have to succeed, you have to maintain this. In other words, you have to continue to be right on. Right there. How can you be right on? Only by practice. In motion, in action, constantly. So when you do gassho, *do* gassho, that’s all. So maintain gassho. Gassho is gassho-ing. This is the true picture of the world around the gassho. If you want to taste real Buddha Nature through the form of gassho, all you have to do is maintain this form of gassho. In the pure sense; it is called undefiled practice, we say. 

So all you have to do is, in the realm of the partition, awaken where the awakening is awakening, you don’t know. 

And then, the precept comes up: not take life. What should you do? Not taking life coming up. How do you understand, how do you accept this precept? Not taking life. You already before you take this precept of not taking life, immediately your computer starts to work and *[sound effects]* lots of lights coming up, you know? And then at superspeed you catch the meaning of the idea of not taking life, in terms of morality, ethics, and physics, biology. *[He laughs.]* Very busy. But it’s very quick; you can do it. So Buddha gives you the precept, not taking life. Then immediately your computer starts to work. So what do you mean? You are participating in where? You are already before and after, completely? Do you understand? Computer work means already you are participating in a different world [than] Buddha teaches you; already you slip off. You already miss the most important point. Everyone has to go through, this is called path, this is called the way. Everyone, all sentient beings, has to pass. Trees, birds. Lions, elephants. All things anyway pass through that world. But human beings always ... 

*[Tape change.]*

... your computer. Human computer, not machinery computer, human computer is working at superspeed. Fantastic [speed], more than a computer. You have it. Perfectly worked. 

So not to take life means already you receive the idea of not taking life. So, already you are participating in the dualistic world, that’s why life is extinguished. You seem to understand it, not taking life. Dualistically, you seem to understand it. You receive the precept of not taking life dualistically. But you don’t understand the *real* meaning of not taking life. Not taking life is completely you *cannot* take life. You cannot take life. Because it’s Buddha’s world. No room to let your head poke into it, because just the energy in motion, dynamic motion. Awakening is awakening: how do you know this? All you can do is just go through this. 

So you have to understand taking life which is taking life is doing taking life. Anyway. That means not taking life itself. You simply cannot take life [of] anything. That is Buddha Nature, Buddha’s world. So finally, practice is, how can you do it? You just be right on, that moment.

So finally, the commentary says, “do not take life.” That’s it. Dogen Zenji says “do not take life,” but no meaning. No meaning. But you want to have meaning. *[He laughs.]* Do you? You want to have a meaning. But strictly speaking: do not take life: yes, sir! That’s it. No meaning. And then from this, lots of meaning coming up. That actually is Buddha’s seed, it is a source of energies. So very naturally it grows, many things grow. But we are always understanding from dualistic world. Participating in the completely different world from [what] Buddha mentions. We also understand Buddha’s teaching itself from a different angle. So we never know the Buddha’s teaching as it really is. That’s why we have to teach real Buddha’s teaching. How do you practice Buddha’s teaching? Even though it seems to be difficult, anyway we have to practice this. Because your life is already like that. 

So from this point, the main purpose of Buddhism is not to attain enlightenment, no. I don’t think so. The main purpose of practice is to form habit as a vow, forever. That is just like take a journey in the universe. Day by day, step by step, anyway you should move. Like walking in the mist: you don’t what the mist is, you don’t know here you are walking, you don’t know what the merit is. All you have to do is just walk. But everything is a blur. And then somebody comes: “Please come here. Let’s walk hand in hand.” 

So this the Buddha’s practice, okay? But people understand the main purpose of Buddhism or Zen is to attain enlightenment. That is a false practice, because you already participate in where? You know? *[He laughs.]* Already the conceptual world. Before and after, missing the most important point! If you miss the most important point, you never understand what human life is. Always you just understand the surface. But it makes you enjoy, because it is the usual way. *[He laughs.]* That’s why people enjoy very much. But they don’t satisfy, that way of life. They have lots of questions. But they don’t know how to practice, but they don’t know to touch that main important point. That’s why they always usually is, “Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go. Better life, better life.” That’s it. But they don’t trust, they don’t feel it is the right way of life. But they don’t know how to, that’s why they are always living there and ... *A* or *B* life, and always going, “Better life, better life, better life.” That’s it. Do you understand? Let’s develop physics. *[He laughs.]* And then what’s going on in the human world? Because they are missing the most important point. 

This is Zen precepts. So Zen precepts are difficult to understand. But anyway, it’s not necessary to try to understand. I think you should receive it, and form a habit, as a *vow*. If you have guidance, that’s fine. So Buddha’s teaching, ancestors, and living teachers, have to walk hand in hand. This is important. Because we don’t know how to practice it. How to maintain [it]. How to form a habit, of a way of living based on the Buddha’s way. We don’t know. That’s why we need guidance, anyway. 

Do you have questions? 

#### 50:10 

**Question**: I’ve always understood what we’re doing here in that we’re trying to get beyond this compulsive choice making that is encapsulated by dualism...

**Katagiri**: Mmm.

**Question**: ... but you seem to say more than that, and that we’re not even aware of the stream of events or the context in which things are occurring. And it strikes me that the mind inevitably must deal with each individual event or object within a context ... 

**Katagiri**: Yes. 

**Question**: ... that is, nothing has meaning unless it’s seen in a stream of events, or as a set of a larger group of objects. It’d be like watching a television program frame by frame, without seeing where thing came from and where they’re going. And so it seems to me that unless we deal with individual things within a larger context, that we just become ignorant. And then we have to have somebody tell us what to do. 

So I guess for me I don’t quite understand the distinction between dualism and this, what you seem to be saying, not being aware of the context of events.

**Katagiri**: I think dualism, that’s why I mentioned as an example the *A* and *B*. *A* and *B* are dualistic world. But if you want to know *A* and *B*, *A* and *B* both go through *this*, the world of the 1/75th of a moment. So you cannot ignore the *A* and *B*. The point is, you have to understand where you are, from where you understand *A* and *B*. 

**Question**: Well, is it then seeing *A* and *B* as part of a set?

**Katagiri**: *A* and *B* is a kind of a flower, and branches, and leaves. But without stem, without root, it’s impossible to grow. What you have to do is, where you are standing. You have to stand up this partition, this world, and see clearly as best as we can where we are standing. And then you can see the *A* and *B* in the universal perspective, and you can deal with it. But usually, people stand up [in] *A* world, or *B* world, and then understand or deal with only *B* world. And then *A* world tries to join into the *B* world, and then people are fighting and struggling, et cetera. Because they don’t stand up here. Do you understand? This is the source of your energies. So-called moment. Moment means you have to go through, in order to under the sleep and awakening from sleep. You have passed through this moment. That moment is, I mentioned, awakening is awakening. 

**Question**: Can you fully experience the present moment and still be aware of the context in which it exists?

**Katagiri**: Yes [you can].

**Question**: Okay. 

**Katagiri**: That is the zazen we do. That’s why in zazen, throw away all worldly affairs, good and bad, right and wrong. *[He laughs.]* We say so. Because if you are involved in the conscious world, you already stand up [in] *A* and *B* conscious world, dualistic world. So you never down here. So you are always looking at zazen in terms of *A* world, in terms of *B* world – either. Before, or after. That’s why you don’t know zazen itself. 

This is called *shikantaza*. *Shikan* – we say *wholeheartedness*. But even though you don’t understand it, if you practice, follow the suggestions, then you can exactly experience, you can touch it. 

So that’s why all we have to do is continually to be *right on there*, *right on there*, *right on there*. This is the way of “facilitating the growth of the Buddha seed.” 

Naturally, it’s growth. But intellectually, we don’t understand, consciousness doesn’t accept easily. Because it’s far from it, but it’s too close to know. 

#### 55:54

**Question**: Hojo-san? I was just wondering if, you using the word *moment*. ... small point here, but I was thinking maybe the word *instant* would be a better choie of words. 

**Katagiri**: Oh. Okay. 

**Question**: Because the moment sometimes can be like I say, “one moment, please,” and then you wait... *[Katagiri laughs]*  ... talking about 1/75th of an instant. 

**Katagiri**: I see. Okay.

**Question**: Because you mean something very brief, no duration.

#### 56:28

**Question**: Hojo-san, sometimes the image I get of zazen when you say zazen is a place where there is no awareness. But I remember Narasaki Roshi’s image of the transparent pyramid. I was thinking of this in terms of Gary’s question. 

**Katagiri**: Transparent?

**Question**: The transparent pyramid, in which we have thinking, non-thinking, and not thinking, are the three sides of the pyramid.

**Katagiri**: Mmm-hmm. Yes.

**Question**: And each is seen through the transparency of the other. 

**Katagiri**: Mmm-hmm.

**Question**: That’s how in the moment, we do not lose contact. 

**Katagiri**: Mmm-hmm. So it’s already, that means interdependent, interpenetration, something like that. *A* and *B* are constantly interdependent, interpenetration, as superspeed. That you can see, if you stand up in this instant world, instant sphere. Instant doesn’t mean instant, *[he chuckles,]* instant means eternal world, very vastness of existence. But it is a source of your life. That’s why I say instant or moment. Let me say instant, do you think? *[He laughs.]* Instant; right there. 

And if you stand up there, the two things and more than two, because around the *A* world many beings exist, around the *B* world many beings exist, and those are interdependent, interpenetrated at superspeed. So you can see the really beautiful panorama pictures. 

That is so-called “I use twenty-four hours,” instead of “being used by twenty-four hours”. But usually a human being is used by *A* and *B*, but they don’t know how to use *A* and *B*. So if you want to use properly *A* and *B* dualistic world, you have to stand up there, as clear as you can. This is awareness. But if you stand up there, awareness is simultaneously no awareness, [it] drops off. But simultaneously awareness is there. So awareness, no awareness [are] always interdependent. 

**Question**: Then the important thing is how you respond to the awareness. If you’re at the partition and you know there’s *A* and *B*, the dualistic, where you say “Oh, I have to be at *A*m” and get all upset, but the way that you’re talking about is [instead] put your consciousness into the moment that you’re in, and accept both *A* and *B*.

**Katagiri**: Yes. But, you should accept, but you shouldn’t be excited too much, you shouldn’t be disappointed too much. Not pessimistic, not optimistic too much. That is called “middle way,” we say “Middle Way.” You should accept *A* and *B* because immediately beautiful pictures you can see, but at that time, that is called you can use it, you can handle it. But don’t be excited too much. So you cannot be optimistic, you cannot be pessimistic... you cannot be neutral. *[He laughs.]* So totally you have to be fully alive, every day, from moment to moment. That’s why Nansen ... says, “Every day is a good day.” “Every day is a good day” means from moment to moment you have to be alive, just like a leaping fish. Anyway you have to. But more or less, we feel pessimistic, and then we are bogged down with, you know, pessimism. Next moment, we love optimistic world, so we are rushing to the other side. *[He laughs.]* And then we’re excited. So we are always missing the most important point. This is the Middle Way. 

I don’t mean you should always [be] “calm.” *[He laughs.]* But always excitement coming up, but within the excitement how much do you excite? This is the question. How much? I don’t know. But if excitement comes up, it’s natural, okay? I don’t mean you *shouldn’t* be excited. You can see the excitement naturally, because it’s dualistic. But a question is, how do you accept excitement to the minimum? In other words, simply, as simple as you can. 

1:02:22

**Question**: Hojo-san? One question. In what you’re saying about being with the moment rather than attaching with *A* or with *B*, how does it fit in with the sense of sometimes needing ideas to guide you, or ideals, or imagining say a social situation in a different kind of way and working toward that? Is that...

**Katagiri**: Ideal image? 

**Question**: Part of your problem solving.

**Katagiri**: Oh, problem. 

Well, many problems. It depends on the problem. Sometimes small problem and sometimes big problem, and sometimes you can find the solution by yourself, but sometimes you cannot. Maybe you have to find the solution with the people together, sometimes it takes a long time. Lots of kinds of problems. But even though it takes a long time to solve, anyway from moment to moment, basically your base, where you stand up, is constantly that sphere I mentioned. That sphere where you are neither excited too much nor pessimistic too much.

**Question**: But in that process is there a place your imagination of an idea.

**Katagiri**: You can use lots of imagination, anyway. For instance, in my case, I have to talk in English, you know? And then if look at myself, this is big problem for me, still a problem. And then, how can I find the solution to this one? But basically, I have to stand up always that Middle Way, constantly stand up, and then I can use lots of ideas. Beautiful image, so-called eternal possibility. *[He laughs.]* Do you understand “eternal possibility”? That is my friend said to me, “Katagiri, you are stupid, because you are awakening always only when you’re reading a book in English.” Not in Japanese; if I started to read the book in Japanese, I started to sleep. *[Laughter.]* But in English, I was pretty busy with looking at the dictionary, so I was awakening. *[He laughs, and the group laughs.]* So he, “you’re stupid,” anyway. And then he put me down, and then next scooped up again and he said, “But, your capability of English is eternal possiblity.” *[Everyone laughs.]* Do you understand? I didn’t understand at that time. *[Everyone laughs.]* So it’s not criticizing, but it’s not good. But it’s not bad. *[He laughs.]* So constantly Middle Way. Okay? 

So I can think, I can think a beautiful, ideal image of my life. I don’t think I should handle my life in terms of certain ideas, so-called “I am stupid,” or I am a particular person. I don’t think it’s necessary to do this. So constantly we have to think something, we have to stand up in the middle, and also using the [philosophy and] ideas. But if you start to use ideas, people are always excited too much, or pessimistic. So you cannot do it. But experience excitement, many things.
