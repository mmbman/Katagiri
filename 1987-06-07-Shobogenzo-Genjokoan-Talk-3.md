#### 0:00 start of recording

Yesterday I mentioned that the important point in [Buddhism](glossary#buddhism) is that we have to feel deeply and directly who we are; such as tasting, realizing *manas*, psychologically speaking. At that time, the realization of manas guides you to touch karmic life, coming from past life. That is [*alayavijñāna*](glossary#alayavijñāna). 

And then, I think it is not good enough for us to deeply or directly feel or to taste who you are by meditation. You have to reach alayavijñāna, so-called karmic consciousness, karmic life; but at that time, there is still a problem: that we are stuck in the concept of karmic life. 

Alayavijñāna is characterized by something going in perpetual series, from the past, through the present, to the future. So, [there is] nothing to pin down, nothing to grasp, nothing to keep you stuck there. It’s always going. If you really feel what your karmic life is, finally there is no concept of *your own* karmic life. Finally what you can see is just [the] flow of energy. That’s it. That is called [*tathāgatagarbha*](glossary#tathāgatagarbha).

There is nothing to put a name on, it is kind of just a perpetual flow of energy. It’s very difficult to put a name on it, but it’s really something real, because it supports your life and also all sentient beings. That is called tathāgatagarbha. At that time, you really appreciate it. 

And then from this, I think religious [ascertainment], and relaxation, or relief, naturally oozes from the bottom of your heart. That is called *faith*. 

So, the main purpose of Buddhist practice is to taste [ego consciousness](glossary#ego-consciousness), who you are, deeply through meditation – but, it’s not good enough. The farther practice is to taste alayavijñāna, karmic life not only conceptually, but directly you should *participate* in alayavijñāna. What is direct participation in alayavijñāna? That is just movement, flow. Perpetual flow of energy to live, to be present. Not only for you, but with all sentient beings. That is a final purpose of Buddhism.

#### 4:57

And then, yesterday I mentioned that most people believe that if you don’t attain enlightenment, you are not Buddhist, you are really a lower class of human being, but I don’t think it is true. Whether you are a deluded person or you are an enlightened person, all sentient beings are [aware]. You should remember this!

But yesterday I mentioned that if you see your life individually, under all circumstances you want to live! That desire comes from where? [Is it] your own desire? No; [it is] not your own desire. I gave you my own story: When the bomb exploded, I immediately ran and jumped into the hole, and chanted the name of Amitaba. Was that my desire? No way. Not my desire. No choice. So under all circumstances, everyone has great energy, capacity to live, to *be*. Completely beyond like or dislike. 

So, you should live there, from the beginning. You should appreciate this energy; you should appreciate this life force gifted to you, from the beginningless past. Anyway, you already have [this] great capacity.

That is [what] we temporarily call [Buddha Nature](glossary#buddha-nature). Or, 2500 years ago, [Buddha Shakyamuni](glossary#shakyamuni-buddha) mentioned, “All are Buddha.” Temporarily, we call [that] Buddha. Buddha is a person who realizes that perpetual flow of energy, flow of existence, constantly [moving] from the beginningless past to the endless future. 

You should participate directly in it. So, what is that? Just be there. And then, manifest it. 

So, strictly speaking, I think everyone is in Buddha’s great world. I think even though you are not an enlightened person, [there is no] discrimination between [Buddha](glossary#buddha) and ordinary people. You are not an enlightened person, but originally you *are* an enlightened person: because you already survive, you are living from day to day. By your own effort? Yes it is [by own effort], but something more than that: by the help of the grasses, rains, sunshine, humidity, the air. By all sentient beings, you can survive. This is the *true* reality. 

So you should live in the vast, expansive realm of the world, surrounded by all sentient beings. Usually we always see the world in the narrow way: “this is my world,” “that is your world,” separately. But first of all we should live in that enormously expansive realm of existence. That is called Buddha Nature. We are Buddha.

#### 9:40

So, let’s look at [Genjokoan](topics#genjokoan).

At the last sentence, there is a conclusion there. The last sentence says: 

> Because the nature of wind is eternal, the wind of Buddhism causes the manifestation of the earth's being gold and by participation develops the long river into butter
>
> (From a translation by Thomas Cleary: [link](http://www.thezensite.com/ZenTeachings/Dogen_Teachings/GenjoKoan_Cleary.htm).)


“The wind of Buddhism”: In this case [Dogen Zenji](glossary#dogen) uses “wind” because he quoted the story of [Zen Master](glossary#zen-master) Hōtetsu of Mount Mayoku using a fan, et cetera. That’s why he is talking about the wind, created by fan. The “wind of Buddhism” means Buddha’s family. So in this case, wind means *lifestyle*; the refined lifestyle of the Buddha’s family. All sentient beings are nothing but Buddha’s family, okay? So, their life has really refined lifestyle [...] What is this? That is to manifest the earth. *The earth* means *alayavijñāna*, karmic life. 

“Being gold”: Turning earth, turning alayavijñāna into gold means *tathāgatagarbha*. 

“And by participation”: You have to participate in this practice, directly. And then at that time you can develop the long river – that means human life. 

“Long river”: Human life, the human world, handed down from century after century. Long, long river. 

“Into butter”: Sweet butter, sweet milk, wonderful milk. That means Buddha’s world; [a] peaceful, harmonious world. 
 
So, what is the responsibility, what is the *duty* for us, if you want to be present in this world as a human being? That is, a human being who has the great refined lifestyle of Buddha’s family. What is the duty? Our duty is to turn the earth – alayavijñāna, alaya world, karmic life – into gold – which means tathāgatagarbha, Buddha’s world. How? You should participate in it, directly. Regardless of whether you judge yourself, “I am enlightened,” or “I am unenlightened,” it doesn’t matter. All you have to do is you should participate in this practice, directly, day by day. And then, at that time, your life ripens, very naturally. So you can develop the long river: your whole life, including past, present, and future, into butter, sweet butter – that means into the peaceful, harmonious world. That is your total personality coming up.

How do you develop the whole personality? It’s not your business. Your business is just to participate in this practice. That’s it! And then, the whole personality is coming up, just like water under the ground coming up if your pipe touches the water [line], naturally water – *[shoop]* – comes up. 

When you see the water coming up from the ground, it is called *whole personality*. By which people are really impressed, and people really want to see such a person. It is necessary for us; and we have such a capability. So, finally, our purpose is just like this. That’s why it is the conclusion of [Genjokoan](shobogenjo#genjokoan).

So, what is the practice for us? *[He chuckles.]* Well, we always say, “We want to attain enlightenment, we want to be enlightened person,” et cetera. We are always “juggling” in the realm of [samsara](glossary#samsara): “You are wrong,” “I am right,” you know? “I practiced for ten years, with this person,” “You are always lazy; you are not Buddhist.” And always, “I love him, so he is my teacher.” It’s ridiculous! *[He laughs, and there is some laughter.]* And then sometimes someone tells you bitter things: “Oh, I don’t like him. He is not my teacher.” Something like that. We’re always juggling like this. 

How do you understand? How do you share your life with all sentient beings, in peace and harmony? No matter how long you talk about compassion, wisdom, kindness, friendliness, with shaking hands; actually, practically, you never built up a peaceful world from day to day. No way. Always you are fighting; [suffering](glossary#suffering). That’s why Dogen Zenji [speaks] like this.

What is our practice? Whoever you are, whatever it is, what you have to do is, try to turn the alayavijñāna into tathāgatagarbha. Turn our earth, the human world, into gold, Buddha’s world. You should participate in it! You can do it. How? That is what [Genjokoan](shobogenjo#genjokoan) explains.

#### 17:56

Let’s go back to the first paragraph. 

Let’s divide [Genjokoan](shobogenjo#genjokoan) into eleven sections... 

(From 18:20 to 21:05, Katagiri Roshi divides the text into sections. These sections mostly line up with the paragraphs in the Thomas Clearly translation we have today (see [link](http://www.thezensite.com/ZenTeachings/Dogen_Teachings/GenjoKoan_Cleary.htm)), with some differences.)

(He has someone read the first paragraph:)

> When all things are Buddha’s teaching, then there is delusion and enlightenment, there is cultivation of practice, there is birth, there is death, there are buddhas, there are sentient beings.  
> When myriad things are all not self, there is no delusion, no enlightenment, no buddhas, no sentient beings, no birth, no death.  
> Because the Buddha Way originally sprang forth from abundance and paucity, there is birth and death, delusion and enlightenment, sentient beings and buddhas.  
> Moreover, though this is so, flowers fall when we cling to them, and weeds only grow when we dislike them.  

Okay. The first section is divided into four sentences. 

#### 

> When all things are Buddha’s teaching, then there is delusion and enlightenment, there is cultivation of practice, there is birth, there is death, there are buddhas, there are sentient beings.  

[The translator] says “Buddha’s teachings”; I think originally [Dogen] said “Buddha-dharma.” Buddha-dharma means the whole universe. *Whole universe* means not a huge avocado seed, okay? It’s not like a huge avocado seed. In other words, the universe is not a huge lump of the earth body. Do you understand? Buddha-dharma means, I told you already, a perpetual flow of energies, always going, and acting. And it’s quiet; but it’s dynamic: it’s always going. That is huge; boundless. There are no boundaries. Always huge, huge. That’s why I sometimes use “vast expanse of existence.” It’s vast. It’s really vastness. 

So first of all, you have to see the human world, human beings, in terms of Buddha’s eye. So the first section is talking about the outlook on the world: how you should see the world, how you understand the human world. So first of all, you have to see the world in terms of Buddha’s eye. 

Yesterday I mentioned, if you see the human world in terms in terms of ordinary people’s eyes, so call alayavijñāna, the world becomes always alayavijñāna – never Buddha’s world. If you see the world in terms of Buddha’s eye, the whole world become Buddha’s world. 

Alayavijñāna means karmic life. If you see karmic life through meditation, you taste it, karmic life, but that karmic life you have tasted is still conceptualized. If you go beyond conceptualization of karmic life, it is nothing but perpetual flow of energies. That’s it. Because, karmic life has been going from the past, present, future, from every direction. So we don’t know what it is. But it’s [actively] working, anyway. So that’s why it’s very difficult to be free from the understanding of karmic life. Because, every day, you can see, you can taste karmic life, so it’s very easy for us to be stuck in karmic life. But originally, karmic life is what? It’s going. Dynamically, from the past, to the present, to the future.

If you go beyond, free from conceptualization of karmic life, at that time you really participate directly in alayavijñāna, which means tathāgatagarbha. Tathāgatagarbha is only when you participate in it, in deep understanding, the profound taste of alayavijñāna, then alayavijñāna turns into Buddha’s world, tathāgatagarbha.

Yesterday I mentioned, [all of] space, *kokū*, falls down to the earth and is *crushed*, and then that is the time when an oak tree becomes Buddha. We are always separated. When the whole sky, whole worlds are crushed, we must be Buddha. When do you become Buddha? When the whole world is crushed; [when there is] nothing to compare. “What do you mean?” Just energy, working; and then, you become Buddha. When you become Buddha, that is the time when the whole earth is crushed. That is direct participation in alayavijñāna, instead of understanding human life in the world of conceptualization. That is very tricky. It’s very difficult to participate in the alayavijñāna directly and turn it into tathāgatagarbha. It’s *very* difficult. Because our head is very strong, stubborn.

That’s why immediately Dogen Zenji [says that] all things are not the all things you have thought; all are Buddhas. You should deal with this. At that time, see the world, see yourself. Do you live alone? No. You are there, with all sentient beings. That’s why delusion and enlightenment, cultivation of practice, and birth and death, and buddhas and all sentient beings, exist simultaneously. This is true reality. What is this? Is this your world, created by you? No. Is this the world created by your life in the past? No. It is something more than that. It’s really expansive, the existence of the world. That’s why [it says this]. 

#### 30:30

And then, next:

> When the myriad dharmas are all not self, there is no delusion, no enlightenment, no buddhas, no sentient beings, no birth, no death.  

(Transcriber’s Note: Katagiri Roshi says *dharmas* instead of *things* here.)

Then at that time, you are you, but you are not you – you are all sentient beings. You are supported by all sentient beings. So you shouldn’t always attach to yourself: “I am great.” I don’t think so; this is really egoistic! If you become *really* great, in other words if you really become mature, you don’t know this maturity. Real maturity is some energy which makes you go smoothly, like a stream of water; people just participating in that stream of water, just like a boat. But if you attach to maturity, this maturity becomes very strict. It’s not a stream of water, so always bumping. Lots of maturity there: your maturity, my maturity – *[laughter]* – always bumping, and creating a creaking sound. Do you understand? That is the human world that we *[unintelligible]*.

That’s why “when myriad dharmas are all not self...” When you see the world in universal perspective, all [doesn’t] have its own ego-sense. No; it’s exactly the flow of energy, nothing but the flow of energy; penetrating, exchanging their own position with somebody else. I change my position with somebody’s position. In other words, I can talk with a bird, I can talk with a rock. I can talk with an Indian elephant. The elephant can shake hands with the Indian monkey. Do you understand that one? Intellectually you don’t understand this, but this is the Buddha’s world. Buddha’s world is shaking hands: if you pick up this one, the whole world picks it up. You don’t believe it, but this is really true. This is the outlook on the human world in terms of Buddha’s eye. Because you live with all sentient beings. Without all sentient beings, how can you survive? There is no possibility.

#### 33:40

And then next, if so, what is true reality? He said:

> Because the Buddha Way originally sprang forth from abundance and paucity, there is birth and death, delusion and enlightenment, sentient beings and buddhas.  

What are the *all sentient beings* you can see with your naked eye? They are not *all sentient beings* seen with your naked eye; something more than abundance and paucity, being or not being. Completely beyond this. That is what? Buddha? I can see the trees, I can see the birds. But birds don’t have their own ego; a tree doesn’t have its own ego; and then, that is a true picture of the trees and birds. [...] going beyond being and not being, like or dislike, paucity and abundance. That is the true reality, of everything. So, a completely different world is coming up. 

#### 35:12

Next, the last sentence (in this section) says, 

> Moreover, though this is so, flowers fall when we cling to them, and weeds only grow when we dislike them.  

Yesterday, Shoken Floyd Winecoff asked me [...] about sadness. Religiously speaking, if you see your karmic life, there is some deep sadness there. For instance, if I look at myself, there is a deep sadness there. Because I cannot control it; you cannot control it in the usual way. It can be controlled, but not in the usual way. That’s why it’s very difficult. So in a sense, [there is] deep sadness there. 

*Deep sadness* means, completely beyond speculation, when you see something, you feel sad, you feel pensive. So when the flower falls, you feel pensive, and you say, “Please, stay on the branch,” you know? When weeds grow, you *hate* it. I’ve really experienced this hatred in the everyday cleaning my temple yard. *[He chuckles.]* Big temple yard, and picking up by myself. I didn’t have a big machine, or chemicals to kill the weeds, so I had to pick up weeds every day when I saw them, you know? It’s really questionable. I always asked [myself], “What [am I] doing here? This is my lifestyle, picking up grasses like this? This is the purpose of a monk’s life?” *[Laughter.]* So I thought, “Oh, [this was a] big mistake.” *[Laughter.]* “Why did I become a monk?” *[Laughter.]* But I had no choice, so I always did it, you know? 

So, that’s really hatred coming up. Flowers bloom and weeds grow beyond your hatred or love. Before, or in advance, it’s blooming. Do you understand? Your life is already blooming, in the same way as the blooming of a flower. So your life is what? Just a blooming flower. Your life is what? Growth of the weeds. Just the same things. But when you see the weed, you separate it; and then, you hate it. But basically, weeds grow in the same way as your presence. Before you poke your head into it, it already grows; the flower blooms. 

But on the other hand, you cannot ignore that feeling. So Dogen Zenji says, let’s come back to everyday life as a human being. What do feel [...]? What do you feel [about] flowers or weeds? Do you feel love? Do you feel you love the weeds? Are you *sure* you love the weeds? We always cut the grass, and then some people say, “don’t cut the grass,” you know? Are you sure you love the weeds? Are you sure you love the insects and the mosquitos? Are you sure? But – you hate them? Are you sure? You don’t hate, you don’t love; [you] don’t know. 

But, it is a fact [that] you feel hatred or you feel love. This is a fact. Very straightforwardly, look at your human life. Your feeling, hatred or love, is not the usual sense of love or hatred you have thought for a long time. Let’s see it a different way, okay? That’s why Dogen Zenji says the last sentence. Dogen Zenji says [to] first bring up the Buddha’s world, how to see the human world. You should see the world in terms of Buddha’s eye. If so, should you hate the [samsaric](glossary#samsara) world? No, no. Come back, please come back – to the human life which exists day by day, with feelings, emotions; hatred, anger, et cetera. 

That’s why yesterday I mentioned I think that instead of always handling a feeling of sadness, we should go back to the important point: how to live, how to see the world. In other words, your basic attitude toward human life. So let the different way you should see the world, from the Buddha’s eye. That is our practice. Because, sadness, feelings, always appear just like bubbles, bubbles coming up, always. You love so much feelings, but next moment it disappears, and love turns into hatred. So it’s always very uneasy. But you cannot ignore that one; that’s why Dogen Zenji brings up this one. Don’t ignore this one. But that feeling – sadness, hatred – is not something you should hate or you should love. You should take care of hatred or love as the Buddha’s world, as a decoration of the Buddhas’ land. 

So if you do it, how do you decorate the human world with hatred, with sadness? That is our practice. Actually deal with it: calm your mind, calm your six senses, and then deal with your life: sadness, hatred, et cetera. It means, deal with life as [it] truly is.

#### 42:42

And then, I think the next paragraph is the contents of all sentient beings. What is the contents of all sentient beings?

> Acting on and witnessing myriad things with the burden of oneself is “delusion.” Acting on and witnessing oneself in the advent of myriad things is enlightenment. 

So here it says, “acting on [and] witnessing myriad things” means cultivating practice and verifying myriad things *by conveying oneself to them* is delusion. In other words, first we try to move toward nature and create the poem. By creating a poem, you can verify the existence of nature, how wonderful it is. [...] But, he says, it is delusion. Yes, it is delusion, because you see the world in terms of your eyes, your feelings: delusion. But is it real delusion? No, no. No way. That is a little bit narrow understanding. That delusion is going in the Buddha’s land, supported by all sentient beings. Because there is no other way! No other way.

If it is delusion, which you should hate – at that time, [is] all sentient nature coming to you and helping you? In the 1960’s and 70’s, always the hippies said, “I don’t know where I am going. The Universe takes care of me.” Something like that. Can you say so? *[He chuckles.]* No way. If you do it, your life becomes a mess. 

So first of all, you have to move toward the nature, toward the world, and take care of it. And then, at that time, you can verify the presence of the world, with you. That’s why we have to do it. But, it is delusion. But we say, “It is right. Enlightenment.” I don’t think it is. Prejudice. Ego. So that’s why, if you see the very ... energetic businessmen, and politicians, whoever they are; you really respect them, because he’s always acting positively, creating something. He’s a wonderful person. But I don’t think it’s wonderful. It is a delusion. 



> Great enlightenment about delusion is Buddhas; great delusion about enlightenment is sentient beings. There are also those who attain enlightenment on top of enlightenment, and there are those who are further deluded in the midst of delusion. 

So, acting on and witness myriad things with the burden of one’s self is delusion. Acting on and witnessing oneself in the advent of myriad things is enlightenment.




But that delusion, the point is: there is no other way, except deluded way, in order to reach whole world. So, important point is: Don’t be stuck in delusion. You can use properly delusion. How? Simply deal with delusions; as simple as you can. There is no reason you should be stuck, you should (be) proud of yourself; no matter how long, no matter what. You are successful in business, or politics, et cetera; even though I became a saint, there is no reason I should be proud of myself. No way. Because it is delusion. That is my karmic life. Just like an owl can see everything at night; something like that. “By practice, I became a saint”: it is wonderful? No; it’s not wonderful. It is just like a owl...

*[Tape change.]*

... because I create it. But on the other hand, please deal with... If so, it is wrong? No, it’s not wrong. Behind this delusion, huge, expansive world is there, by which your delusion is supported. So, don’t get stuck with delusion. Please use delusion in universal perspective. That is a [bodhisattva](glossary#bodhisattva) practice. That’s why bodhisattvas suffer from their life, and also from peoples’ life, all sentient beings’ life: how to save, how to help all sentient beings. Is that clear? 

And then, that’s why next, he says, “acting on, witness(ing) oneself in advent of myriad things is enlightenment”. So already there is... your life, your delusion is already manifested in the advent of myriad things. That is your way of life. That is a unique way to approach, to know the total picture of the life, human world. 

#### 48:38

So, delusion and enlightenment work together. So that’s why ... always [bodhisattva](glossary#bodhisattva) is characterized by working with all sentient beings hand in hand, instead of getting into buddha’s position. Becoming buddha - they don’t want! So, always working. But behind bodhisattva’s delusion, there is a buddha there. So-called enlightenment. That’s why, if you read scriptures, always bodhisattva appears in front. And behind, the buddhas. Always the buddha is behind the bodhisattva, supporting. 

So if you read the scriptures, there is something very quiet, silent, beyond [bodhisattvas](glossary#bodhisattva) activities in the front. There is something - quietness. That quietness is described sometimes (as) [emptiness](glossary#śūnyatā).

It’s very interesting: if you sit down quietly and read scriptures, very naturally, you can see first, the [bodhisattva](glossary#bodhisattva) for activities, and dynamism, in the front of the existence. But behind, always there is something there, which is quiet and supportive.

#### 50:17

Next, “great enlightenment about delusion is buddhas”. That’s why you should know what delusion is. That is called buddha. Delusion is not something you should hate or keep away from. So you should have great enlightenment about delusion; then you become [bodhisattva](glossary#bodhisattva). Bodhisattva: then you can help, you can share. For instance, you always try to help, but people don’t accept you. This is [suffering](glossary#suffering). But suffering is okay... Not okay, but there is no other way. So, if the help is good, you have to consider again and again how to help people, all people, all kinds of people. Whatever happens, accepting or not accepting, anyway you should continually consider carefully how to help. That is really delusion. Don’t you think so? It’s delusion, by which you suffer. But this is a bodhisattva. 

That delusion is really supported by enlightenment. That’s why next sentence says, “great delusion about enlightenment is sentient beings.” That is called *you*. Ordinary people. Ordinary people are persons who have attained ... really deeply ... what delusion is. Then, this is called all sentient beings.

#### 52:17

“There are also those who attain enlightenment on top of enlightenment, and there are those are farther deluded in the midst of delusion.” That’s why, what you have to do is, you are always acting and helping all sentient beings as a Buddhist. Always acting. But on the other hand, you are always acting, the [bodhisattvas](glossary#bodhisattva) who suffer a lot. So obviously, you are doing in the realm of delusion. But on the other hand, there is a great supporter there, called Buddha. So, who is helping people? Buddha helps, in the realm of buddhas.

#### 53:10

In the saying, 

> When the Buddhas are indeed the Buddhas, there is no need to be self-conscious of being Buddhas; nevertheless it is realizing buddhahood, Buddhas go on realizing.


That’s why, “What is this? How do you know this? How you feel stable? Please give me the stability and faith and the strength, by practicing this. Katagiri mentions, Buddha mentions, [ancestor](glossary#ancestor) mentions. Please give me something!” But, no way; I don’t know. I don’t have anything to give you. So all you have to do is, just do it. If you just do it, participate directly in the perpetual flow of energy, at that time, there is no way to know. But, it is, you can realize it.

So, it’s... just like your body soaks in the stream. And then, your whole body (is) wet. But, we always scoop the water into our bodies. If you feel thirst, you always scoop the water and you drink, and then you feel good; and next moment, some thirst comes again. So if you really quench your thirst, you jump into the water; you soak your body and mind into the river. And then, the river water soaks through your huge pores, just like a bamboo basket. Your body is just like a bamboo basket; do you understand? Like the pores. But you don’t believe it. If you soak it, and then water falls through there, lots of immediate holes there. That is the pores.

#### 55:37

That’s why you sense when the buddhas are indeed the buddhas, at that time, you become buddhas. With great enlightenment about delusion, is all sentient beings. That is you. Great enlightenment about delusion is buddhas; great delusion about enlightenment is sentient beings, because, how to save all sentient beings? How to guide deluded, stubborn people to buddha’s way? It’s very hard. It’s really tired. *[Laughter.]* But this is... anyway, there is no other way. So you have to continue to live. That is great delusion about enlightenment. This is called sentient being. This is called *you*. 

And then, at that time, if you do it, that is called buddha becomes buddha. But, how do we know? Who proves this? 

There is no need to be self conscious of being buddhas. No. Because, just perpetual flow of energies. You just be there. Just like being present in a jet airplane, I always mention - just be there. 

Nevertheless, it is realizing buddhahood. Buddhas go on realizing means, that way of practice makes your life mature, naturally. Before you know it, mature. This is called shu-gyō(?) - practice. He translated it “cultivating practice”. Practice is constantly cultivating; there is no “top,” no end. Constantly cultivating.

#### 57:50

Next, in seeing how do we do this... he says, that practice seems to be very hard. But he mentions, there is a way. He says, 

> In seeing forms with the whole body-mind, hearing sound with the whole body-mind, though one intimately understands, it isn't like reflecting images in a mirror, it's not like water and the moon-when you witness one side, one side is obscure.

So, all you have to do is, anyway, to bore a hole, you should throw away whole body and mind into your object. At that time, your body is reflected in the realm of your object. And interconnected and interpenetrating each other at super-speed, just like moon and water. But, never disturbed. Just creating the world; so-called “how beautiful it is”. You feel this one, simultaneously. That’s why it says, it isn’t like reflecting image in the mirror, it is not like water and the moon. Because if you see the water and the moon, you separate. If you attain enlightenment, all sentient beings are reflected in your whole body and mind. And then, you say, “I am Universe!” *[He laughs.]* That’s ridiculous. And then when you fall, and when you walk, a little far from the earth, three feet and five feet and walking, and then you say, “I am saint. Whole universe helps my life, and free from.” That is not real enlightenment. That’s ridiculous. That is called *prejudice*, okay? *[Laughter.]*

So, that’s why it says, it is not like a reflecting image in the mirror. If you believe religion is to experience such a miracle, flying in the sky, that is just like relationship between... water and the moon. That’s it. But real enlightenment is not like that. That’s why he says it isn’t like a reflecting image in the mirror, it is not like water and the moon. When you witness one side, one side is obscure. So, what is real enlightenment, what is real activity of human beings? At that time, when the moon is reflected in the water, whole water becomes moon. That’s it. Whole universe. 

So, you cannot see the moon, because moon’s penetrated and disappeared, melted into your body and mind. So it is, you can experience; the way you climb, walk mountains, and then you have a consciousness, and always using a consciousness. But the more you really devote yourself into the rock mountains. Because no choice to escape, so it requires enormous attention to it. At that time, mind penetrates, your body and mind finally melts away. So where is it? What is this? What are they? They are just body; there is no work. Rock penetrated your body; just your body is there. But your body, through the rock procedures, using boots, using a rope, et cetera; that your body doesn’t confuse, because mind is there, rock is there; but all are penetrated and melted away, so whole body is rock, whole body is rock mountain. And then, how do we know? Just climb. Activity of climb; perpetual flow of activity, called climbing. From moment to moment. That’s it.

Buddhas teaching is often mentioning about this one; worried about human beings from that point of view. That’s why, a little difficult. That’s why Dogen Zenji brings (it) up first. You should see the world in terms of buddha’s eye.

... This last sentence, “When you witness one side, one side is obscure,” this is a crucial point of buddha’s practice. If you explain this one, then the teaching of [egolessness](glossary#egolessness), interconnection, interpenetration, interdependent co-origination, something, teaching coming up. But, when you witness one side once the other side is obscure, (it) is whole world penetrated, to you. At that time, your life becomes very secure, very secure. (I can’t tell for sure if he’s saying “secure,” “skilled”, “pure,” or some combination thereof.) Stand up, and walk. Gassho becomes gassho; gassho settles in gassho, exactly, because whole world is gassho. Whole world is walking. That’s why Dogen Zenji mentions the mountain walks. But intellectually, you cannot believe it, but from this point of view, mountain walks. But how do you know? You just walk. Then, whole mountain walks. This is same applied to sports and everything. Without this one, you cannot taste the profundity of sports, profundity of arts, profundity of physics. No. 

So, this is a key point. And then, the rest of things are explaining about this, in a concrete way. So, I don’t know if we have enough time. 

So please remember, the last sentence of this chapter, is the conclusion. What is the point? What is the advantage of practice? [Someone] asked me, couple of days ago, what is the advantage of practice for human being? That is, to turn earth into the gold. It means, even though whatever happens in the world - fighting, killing each other - but all we have to do is, from the beginning to the end, even one person, let’s turn the earth into the gold. That is what you can do it. 

If you do it, that is called way to turn alayavijñāna into tathāgatagarbha. That is called “world become buddha”. That is actual practice to build up buddha’s world. But most people understand the world in the light of the world of conceptualization. That’s why when you see the world (is) miserable, then you say, “Terrible; no choice to build up peace.” But that is still, you are playing with world of conceptualization; just a game. No. World is not game. World is very close to you, and helping, and also strict. You have to do it, otherwise, you will die. You know? You are suffocating. 

So, no way; if you don’t do it, anything like the Buddha’s suggestions, ancestors’ suggestions like this, no way to build up peaceful world. So, remember, this is a key point. But if you teach this one philosophically, that is called egolessness. Egolessness, interdependent co-origination; lots of teaching coming up. The point is, regardless of whether you understand egolessness or not, there is a unique way to practice, for everyone. Everyone can do it.

Okay, do you have a question? I’m sorry, I didn’t finish.

#### 1:08:22

**Question**: Can you go back to this last point, “When you witness one side, the other side is obscure”? I didn’t understand...

**Katagiri**: Okay, first, I recommended a book, “Beyond Boredom and Anxiety”. In this book, I think he mentions about expert of mountaineers and rock climbers, et cetera. They mention about the oneness with the rock mountain and his body and his mind. But he or she doesn’t feel any tiredness and consciousness; just the flow of experience, that’s it. 

> (Note: The book [Beyond Boredom and Anxiety: Experiencing Flow in Work and Play, 25th Anniversary Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0787951404/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_12kgFbNB8X9GK) by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi is available but expensive. However, the more recent [Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0061339202/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_q5kgFb0P5YW6R) by the same author is now a popular mainstream book. It is well worth checking out.)

... What do you mean, just the flow of experience? Just the flow of activity, when you climb the mountain - what is it? Just the flow of activities called “climbing the mountain”. At that time, where are they, what are they? Right in the middle of perpetual flow of activities, there is rock, mountain, tree, your consciousness, feelings, past, present, future; all things come together. And then, this is temporarily called “perpetual flow of activities,” called “climbing the mountain”. Without all sentient beings, you cannot climb. That’s why “one side is manifested, and the other side is obscured.” The other side means, rest of the existence. Whole world comes into you. That is, what? Just practice, just practice. Total manifestation of perpetual flow of activities. And then, if you experience, philosophically, etymologically speaking, that is Buddhist psychology, Buddhist philosophy. And that makes you confused. But it helps.

#### 1:10:42

**Question**: When one side is obscure - that’s when all things are sentient beings. 

**Katagiri**: Yes.

**Question**: When no side is obscure - that’s when all things are buddhas. 

**Katagiri**: Yeah; behind, anyway. In other words, all sentient beings are behind you, always supporting. We are always going in front. But we have a back. But we don’t see the back, you know; we always see the front, what’s going on. But we always ignore the back. The back is huge. So, “the other sentient beings are obscure” means “with a back,” in other words, behind you, and then supporting. Even though you don’t like crying, “Oh, go ahead, go ahead,” in many ways. *[Laughter.]*

That’s spiritual teacher. If you become a spiritual teacher, you must be like that. You cannot be a front. If you become a front person, if you become a person in front, it’s trouble maker. So if you become a spiritual teacher, you must be always a person of behind. But, it really helps.
