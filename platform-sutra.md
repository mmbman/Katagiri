##### [*Platform Sutra* – Talk 1](1987-03-06-Platform-Sutra-Talk-1)

Katagiri Roshi introduces a series of seven talks on the *Platform Sutra,* the recorded teaching of Hui Neng, the Sixth Ancestor in China. This talk comments on Chapter 1, “Action and Intention,” which includes the famous “poetry contest.” He discusses the controversy of whether the point of Zen is “to see into one’s own nature and achieve Buddhahood.”

##### [*Platform Sutra* – Talk 2](1987-03-20-Platform-Sutra-Talk-2)

Katagiri Roshi begins commenting on Chapter 2 of the *Platform Sutra*, “*Prajna*,” or “Wisdom.” This talk includes the meaning of the term *maha prajnaparamita*, and three aspects of *prajna*.

##### [*Platform Sutra* – Talk 3](1987-03-27-Platform-Sutra-Talk-3)

Katagiri Roshi continues his commentary on Chapter 2 of the *Platform Sutra,* further discussing the meaning of the terms *maha*, *prajna* and *paramita*. He discusses the relation of the sutra to the three kinds of emptiness, how life and death and nirvana are the same, *kanno-doko* or spiritual communion between you and the universe, and transforming the three poisons into the Precepts.

##### [*Platform Sutra* – Talk 4](1987-04-03-Platform-Sutra-Talk-4)

Katagiri Roshi comments further on whether the point of Zen is actually “to see one’s own nature and realize the Buddha Way.” He connects this to a passage from the “Scripture of Mountains and Waters” in *Shobogenzo* which relates to four kinds of misunderstanding of Buddhism, including the one we usually subscribe to. The main point of practice is *to achieve continuity of going beyond*. We have to pay attention to Buddhist teaching and simultaneously produce creative life, like morning flowers blooming from a trellis.

##### [*Platform Sutra* – Talk 5](1987-04-10-Platform-Sutra-Talk-5)

Katagiri Roshi continues to discuss *three-fold emptiness*, and how to *achieve continuity of going beyond* by dealing with all phenomena directly, with compassion and kindness. What does it mean to experience *kensho*? There is a longer explanation of how the three poisons (greed, anger, and ignorance) transform into the three “learnings” (morality, concentration, and wisdom).

##### [*Platform Sutra* – Talk 6](1987-04-17-Platform-Sutra-Talk-6)

Katagiri Roshi discusses “the conduct of not dwelling inwardly or outwardly, of coming and going freely, of casting away the grasping mind, and of unobstructed penetration,” and also the statement that “if there were no people the ten thousand dharmas would not exist.” Buddhist teachings come from the human heart, not the other way around. There is a long question and discussion about how to relate to “non-attachment to objects” as an object.
