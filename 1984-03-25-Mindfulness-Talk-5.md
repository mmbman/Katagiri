The last sentence of the passage we studied yesterday should be explained a little more, because the translation is not so good. I said “we should study the truth that there is the approach to Buddha where we are taking advantage of.” I have to something about this. Maybe, I don’t know, maybe I can say “We should clarify the principle, or truth, that there is approach to Buddhas at the place where we are moving in the deep course of the practice.” We are practicing. 

In Japanese we say *nen jo*, literally “at the place where we take form of.” You know the stories of Buddha Shakyamuni when he transmitted his dharma in front of the assembly he took the udambara flower and showed it to the assembly, and Mahākāśyapa smiled. Mahākāśyapa responded to the Buddha Shakyamuni’s demonstration with a smile. That means taking the udambara flower, and showing it to the assembly, simultaneously there is some response from the audience, from the assembly. So nen jo means at the place where we take form; that’s we can take something, anyway. We can take something, and you can communicate, you can have dynamic communication. If you want to compose of poem about nature or wilderness and beuty of existence, whatever, anyway you have to move toward first. See the nature, be with the nature. That is then simultaneously you can have dynamic communication between nature and you. That is “at the place where we take form of something”. Literally that means at the place where we are *using* something. Using is not a good term. I don’t know. So practice, actually. But I think if you read the book Refining Your Life, Dogen Zenji mentions about that. For instance, taking a piece of vegetables and build up Buddha’s temple, Buddha’s world. That means, well it depends on your practice, whether you kill the vegetable or you make life of vegetable alive. Aiming at the human life for long line. If your range is very short, I think this vegetable is just for eating, for breakfast and dinner, et cetera. But if you deal with the piece of vegetable for taking care of the people who practice in Buddha’s way for life after life, at that time you have to take care of the piece of vegetable with very careful, compassionate spirit. Very naturally a different world is opened, the flower of the world is blooming in a completely different way. So that is *nen jo*. *At the place* means occassion, too: time and space. So at the place or on the occassion of dealing with a piece of a vegetable, and then that occassion and place is very important for us. To build what? Human egoistic world, or individual egoistic world? Or Buddha’s world? That place is very important; that is called Buddha. You can do anything at that place. YOu can be a bank robber; you can be a pickpocket, you can do gassho at that moment, on that occassion. So it’s really depends on you, on your practice. What would you do? So that’s why this is *nen jo*. At that time, the place or occassion is really opening to you. To reach Buddha’s world, or help human beings, or creating human egoistic world. It depends on your practice, you attitude toward how to deal with that place or occassion. So that’s why that is the meaning of this last sentence. So I don’t know how I can translate it. This translation is completely different way, because it makes sense for me. So we should clarify that principle or the truth; that is really the truth. Open universal to everyone, regardless of whether you become a Buddhist or not. Christianity or non-Christians, it’s really universal. 

So that is we should study that truth, principle, open to everyone. Or trees, birds, everything. That there is a lord, the lord or passageway, the approach, at the place where we are moving in the deep course of practice.

And then next Dogen Zenji takes the method of washing the robe as an example, in the next passage. Let me read it first: 

> For example, it is just like the method of washing a robe. Water is contaminated by the robe; the robe is soaked in water. Although the robe is cleaned with the aid of water and by changing the water, water is still being used, and the robe is being washed. More than one or two washings are necessary, and we shouldn’t rest until it is clean. When the water is used up, we put more water in. We wash the clean robe again to make it cleaner. It is good for the robe to be clean, that all kinds of water are used. We must clarify the principle that there is a fish in dirty water. 

In the context of this passage, there is something more than the method of washing the robe. As an example he takes a method of washing a robe, but this is the method of Buddhist practice. So I would like to explain a little bit about this.

> For example, it is just like the method of washing a robe. Water is contaminated by the robe...

This example is really close relation with the last sentence of the previous passage we studied yesterday. I mentioned that we should study the principle there is the approach at the place where we are practicing. This paragraph we are studying today is nothing but the explanation of last sentence of previous passage. About opportunity or place where we are practicing. Water is the place, water is the opportunity or occasion where we are practicing. 

> ... the robe is soaked in water. 

When you wash the clothes, Buddha’s robe, okesa or rakusu, you have to soak the robe in the water. Simultaneously the water is contaminated by the robe. That means subject and object. Simultaneously you have to deal with, instead of watching something in the distance without doing anything. If you want to clean the robe, put it in the water. You have to wash it. That is the place and occasion you can have open road to pass through. That’s why here it says if you do something simultaneously, water is contaminated. In other words, if you want to do zazen, then *do zazen*. Simultaneously zazen is contaminated by you, and you are immediately soaked in zazen. That is called at the place you are practicing, on the occasion you are practicing there. And then something happens; very naturally zazen and you are communicating dynamically. And next he says, 

> Although the robe is cleaned with the aid of water and by changing the water, water is still being used, and the robe is being washed. 

Do you understand this one? *[He chuckles.]* Well, although the robe is cleaned with the aid of water and by changing the water means, if you want to clean the robe, you have to use water. And also, you have to change the water again and again. So if you want to do zazen, anyway you should use zazen. And again and again you have to change zazen, because every sesshin is different, don’t you think so? So you should change the spirit of sesshin. In other words, change the water means you must refresh, always. Your spirit must be fresh, the spirit of sesshin must be fresh, every time. That is changing the water. Change the water constantly until its clean. So that is the point it says here. 

But cleaned means, you should remember, Dogen Zenji says water is contaminated by robe; already there is subject and object, in the light of human concept. So zazen is contaminated, you are soaked in zazen. So you are always thinking. So if you see the contaminated zazen you don’t like it, so you want to clean the zazen. But if you start to wash the robe, so-called practicioner, simultaneously water is contaminated by the practicioner. That’s pretty natural. Even though you see the contaminated water, constnatly you should use water, nothing else. If you want to zazen, use zazen, whatever happens. Under all circumstances: up, and down, up and down. Under all circumstances continually use water ... zazen. But we don’t do it in that way. When you feel bored and you don’t like it, so you want to get up from zazen and use somethign else, because there are lots of things by which you are captured, fantastic things in this world. So I think if you feel bored, it’s not necessary to do zazen. I understand that. If you want to do something else, you can do it. But remember, if you want to be a painter, you have to be a painter. How? You should wash by the canvas, and the watercolors, constantly using the watercolors, even though you feel bored, even though you see the success or even though you see the failure of becoming a painter, anyway using the paint, constantly. And changing the water, again and again. Just like a dancer always practices. If you want to be a dancer you have to continually use the water, so-called dance. Nothing else. But most peopel want to practice dance only when they feel good. That’s very common. But if you want to be a dancer, you have to continually use the water. That’s the point in this sentence: “Although the robe is cleaned with the aid of water and by changing the water, water is still being used, and the robe is being washed.” Anyway it’s dynamic communication, dynamic communication is taking place constantly. 

Then next he says, 

> More than one or two washings are necessary, and we shouldn’t rest until it is clean. 

When the water is used, we put more water in. We wash the clean robe again to make it cleaner. This is also very important point for practice. “More than one or two washing are necessary.” Maybe one or two, maybe countless number, countless times you have to wash. “And we shouldn’t rest until it is clean.” Constantly we have to keep washing. 

So that is the practice of a dancer, practice of becoming a painter, practice of a poet, practice of professional job. And when the water is used up, we put more water in. Sometimes you completely lose the spirit, and sometimes you feel disappointed. At that time, pour the water again. Pour the water again means listening to Buddha’s teaching again. Open yourself and listen to and contemplate what you have listened, and practice continually. So that is when the water is used up, 

> We wash the clean robe again to make it cleaner.
