#### 0:00 start of recording

I told you already, [the ceremony of lay ordination,] consists of repentance, the Three Treasures, Buddha dharma, and sangha, the three collective pure precepts, and ten prohibitory precepts. I already talked about repentance, and also a little bit about the Three Treasures. 

The ritual of lay ordination is based on the idea of repentance, which means perfect openness of your heart. Repentance is not to apologize to somebody or something. You should open yourself, completely. If you do it, then consciously or unconsciously you are ready to listen to the voiceless voice of the universe, exactly. This is our practice, okay? So that’s why repentance is called *formless repentance*. 

Anyway, briefly speaking, first we do repentance, which means perfect openness of your heart, which allows you to be ready to the voiceless voice of the whole universe. That is repentance. 

And then, the Triple Treasure is that if you open your heart, next, you have to behave in the realm of the universe. Not out of the universe, and not inside of the universe, because your whole body and mind is completely embraced by the whole universe, so you have to behave in the realm of the universe. So how do you do this? You have to manifest your life in the realm of the universe. There is no other way to go. 

So how should we manifest ourselves in the realm of the universe? That is next: the Triple Treasure, [or] the Three Refuges. 

The Three Refuges are the three goals in life. When you realize your existence in the realm of the universe, then, naturally, you can see the goal in life. In other words, how do you manifest your life in the realm of the universe, or with the universe, or with all sentient beings. 

Then, the three collective pure precepts. This is living in profound aspiration to help all sentient beings. 

And then, the ten prohibitory precepts are to throw yourself into the universe. How? This is the ten prohibitory precepts. Putting aside your ego; putting aside yourself in the ego to assert itself. So anyway, putting aside. How do you put yourself aside, in the ego, to assert itself? Well, you have to follow the teaching, and at least ten prohibitory precepts. 

So the structure of the ritual, remember? Repentance: this is perfect openness of your heart, which allows you to be ready to listen to the universe. This is completely beyond your judgement or understanding. If you do it, exactly you can open. So all you can do is, you should carry the continuity of this practice forever, day by day, regardless of whether you can feel the voice of the universe or not. No. This is your consciousness. Your consciousness is always irritating to know or not to know. So perfect opening is completely beyond the irritation of your consciousness. Anyway you should open. How? This is repentance. 

Next, the Three Treasures, this is the three goals in life. Everyone should go to that target. Our effort is directed toward the Three Treasures: Buddha, dharma, sangha. 

Next, your have to have very profound aspiration for living in peace and harmony with all sentient beings. This is the three collective pure precepts.

And then next, individually, we have to throw ourselves into Buddha’s world, the universe. Putting aside yourself in the ego to assert itself. Constantly we assert ourselves within the egoistic life. 

So this is the structure of lay ordination. So today, I would like to talk a little more about the Three Treasures. I use a different term sometimes, the Triple Treasure, or the Three Refuges. Whatever I use, they are all the same, okay? 

#### 9:10

So, I said already the Three Refuges refer to the three goals in life. But what is one’s goal in life toward which ones effort is directed if you become a Buddhist? Buddhist means universal being, okay? Anyway, without being caught by the idea of sectarianism, what is one’s goal in life toward which one’s effort is directed? If you become a universal being, what is the goal?

Goal means the lofty ideal image of human being, which repose and bliss, or peace and harmony, originate from. So everyone unconsciously, seeking for or groping for something trustworthy, something dependable beyond worldly affairs. Which you can feel relieved. More or less everyone is constantly seeking for this, or groping for. That’s why we suffer. This is called *inception of suffering*. This is suffering. Even though you feel happy, there is suffering – because you want to keep it. Why do you want to keep it? So constantly, whatever your lifestyle may be, happy or unhappy, there is always suffering. Suffering means unsatisfaction. There is an unsatisfactory feeling there. Means you want to grasp or get something trustworthy perfectly, or dependable completely. This is that which we are always seeking for. 

So we say that is a goal, this is the goal in life. That goal is not something you can get in the realm of the conscious world, not in the realm of the unconscious world – something more than the conscious world and the unconscious world. You don’t know what it is, but you are seeking for it everyday. That’s why we say it is suffering, or unsatisfaction. Because whatever you get, happiness or happiness, justice or injustice, whatever you get in the realm of worldy affairs, you aren’t satisfied. So aren’t you satisfied? Because you are still seeking for something more than you have gotten. This is pretty deep. I don’t know what it is. No one knows what it is; but we are seeking. This is called goal in life. 

That goal is very lofty, sublime image of human beings. Everyone has it. So I say lofty; lofty is sublime. Sublime means of high spiritual, moral, and intellectual world. This is sublime. So you have to appreciate your life, because your life is sublime. Lofty. That means your life, physically and mentally, has spiritual and moral ethical, intellectual worth. So that’s why everyone respects others. 

So very naturally, the Three Refuges, which means we take refuge in the Three Treasures, Buddha, dharma, sangha – how do we take refuge in Buddha, dharma, sangha? Not only emotionally; no. Not only intellectually; no. Not only in terms of the moral sense; not only in terms of sensation or emotion. Not only in terms of intellectual worth only. You have to understand, you have to accept the Three Treasures in terms of spiritual, moral, intellectual, emotional worth. And then, this is called faith. If you do it, very naturally faith comes up from the bottom of your life. 

So that’s why I say “the lofty, sublime, ideal image of human beings” – how we should live in this world in peace and harmony. As long as you were born in this world as a human being, there is the goal in life, there is the goal in human society. So everyone should go toward that. Everyone’s effort should be directed toward that goal. Because you exist in the certain society, so-called America, so-called Minnesota. Minnesota has the goal in its society. According to the weathers, a definite change of the weather, and according to the Midwest, et cetera. So very naturally, everyone’s effort should be directed toward the goal in Minnesota society. If you live in the United States, you have to go toward the goal. You know the goal in American society. And then, everyone can live in peace and harmony. 

#### 18:34

So let’s see the Three Treasures, in terms of spiritual, moral, emotional, ethical, and intellectual. Let’s see the Three Treasures like this. Otherwise, you become very emotional. To believe, or to get into your effort is directed toward the Three Treasures, very emotionally. If you ignore intellectual worth. Or, if you are really dependent on intellectual worth, you ignore emotional aspect of human life. So it is not proper, right way of faith. So you have to accept the faith or Three Treasures in terms of the *whole* situation of your life: emotion, intellect, and spiritual. 

First, let’s see the Three Treasures in terms of philosophical worth. At that time, Buddha refers to truth itself. Buddha means exactly the truth itself; the whole universe itself. The essence of the universe, the essence of being itself, we call the truth. We call the universal life, common to all sentient beings: trees, birds, human beings, pebbles, rivers, mountains. The dharma refers to cleanness and purity, which allows all beings to be free from worldly dust. 

So from this philosophical point of view, I think that winter, look at this winter. According to your individual emotional pattern of life. At that time, someone accepts this winter, someone doesn’t accept this winter, someone hates, someone loves. So various style of life comes up. But according to the dharma, in terms of the philosophical worth, I think the winter is the beauty itself. So if you see the winter, immediately you are impressed by it, because winter is dharma. Which refers the cleanness and purity, which allows all beings to be free from worldly affairs, which means free from our thoughts and evaluations or judgements. Completely all the dharma allows everything to be free from any dust. That’s why at the very moment of meeting this winter, you are really moved. The next moment, you don’t know the reason why you are moved. But anyway, you are moved. The way you have been moved by exists the presence of winter in Minnesota, that means you are connected, you have really communion with the universe. So from this point, winter, trees, snow, sky, all are dharma, we say. It means cleanness and purity. Or peace and harmony. Perfectly, all sentient beings are really peaceful and harmonious. And clear and pure. That is the state of all sentient beings in terms of philosophical worth. That is completely beyond your judgement or evaluation. 

Next: sangha. Sangha means, in this case, peace and harmony which allows all beings to be free from confusion and perverted views and misunderstandings. That why Dogen Zenji says if you want to practice the Buddha Way, you should believe in the human world which is based on no confusion, no upset, no perverted view, no misunderstanding. So originally, all sentient beings are very peaceful, exactly peaceful, harmonious. This is called *sangha*. 

So in terms of the philosophical word, Buddha is the truth itself, and dharma is the form of all sentient beings, regarded as just purity, cleanness. So that’s why you can learn many things from all sentient beings: good or bad or evil, war or peace, you can learn lots.

And sangha means all sentient beings are originally peaceful or harmonious. That’s why you can communicate. If you open your heart, you communicate naturally. You can have very spiritual communion between you and the universe. 

That is the philosophical worth of the Three Treasures.

#### 26:20

[Second,] let’s see the Three Treasures in terms of virtue – means the characteristics of the Three Treasures. 

At that time, *the Buddha* means actualized realization of the supreme way. So Buddha means constantly the universe, existence, is nothing but the total manifestation of the truth, that’s it. Temporarily we call this *existence*, if you use [secular] term. But existence is not a philosophical term. This is something more than philosophical concept, so-called existence. How can I say it? I don’t know. If you use existence, immediately existence can be seen in terms of philosophical concept. But it’s not. So very naturally, you have to see something more than philosophical sense of existence, so we say not-existence. That’s why we have to negate the usual concept of existence, because in order to see something more than the philosophical concept of existence, we should forget that term, and then open yourself, and practically, let’s see what it is. So very naturally, intellectually, we have to negate the term, the usual concept so-called existence. So that’s why if you want to know real Buddha in terms of the virtue of the Three Treasures, you have to see existence as a whole. 

I’m sorry, this is not actualization of the supreme way. Oh yes, that’s true. That’s correct. Actualized realization of the supreme way. Actualized. already actualized. The truth is already actualized, before you poke your head into existence. So that’s why I say actualized realization. I told you before, realization means to accept and to digest. Realization means you should accept something [in] your life, subject and object, and next, you have to digest both of them totally, until they disappear beyond trace. So they become subject and object don’t leave their own trace, concept, or idea; no. Completely they turn into energy, life energy. 

So this is realization. So realization is the [world]; all sentient beings are exactly actualized realization of the truth. That’s why we can live in the world. 

The next, dharma, dharma means that which the Buddha has realized. What he has realized is “I have attained enlightenment, simultaneously with all sentient beings.” This is the dharma. So in terms of the virtue of the Three Treasures, dharma is what the Buddha has realized. In other words, all beings are nothing but realized being, enlightened being. Because Buddha says, “I attain enlightenment simultaneously with all sentient beings.” So you have to see or hear with your whole body and mind, and deal with all sentient beings, in terms of enlightened beings. So very naturally, you can share the compassion or kindness to all.

So that is the dharma. That’s why dharma is what he has realized. So what is the content of what the Buddha has realized? That is “I have attained enlightenment simultaneously with all beings.” So it means all being which the Buddha is amply present in. In other words, the truth is amply present in. So everyone is the truth. 

So the form of Katagiri is what? Form of Katagiri is manifestation of Buddha, truth. Because this is the content of what Buddha has realized, 2500 years ago. Even though we don’t understand it, it is really true, because the ancestors, buddhas from generation to generation, have transmitted that essential teaching to the next generation.

Next, sangha. Sangha is to learn, to study, to practice this Buddha, this dharma. This is the sangha, in terms of virtue. So very naturally, you can feel appreciation, because the worlds existence is that which the truth is manifested constantly, consistently. Temporarily this is called existence. And also next as the dharma, each of existence is what? All beings are nothing but that which Buddha has realized. So all sentient beings are enlightened beings. So nothing to waste. You have to really deal with all sentient beings with compassion, with kindness, with appreciation. 

And then, whether you understand or don’t understand, it doesn’t matter, the sangha is that you have to continue to learn and study and practice this Buddha, this dharma in everyday life. 

This is the Three Treasures in terms of virtue. 

#### 35:56

Third, the Three Treasures in terms of *functioning*.

In this case, the Buddha refers to he constantly edifies all beings wherever they may be.

Ponder some aspect of the Buddhist teachings called the Three Thousand Worlds in a Moment, in a Single Thought. In other words, there are three thousand words manifested in a single thought. That is ten categories there, of the world: hell, hungry ghost, fighting spirits, animal spirit, human beings, celestial beings, pratekya buddha, srivaka buddha, bodhisatva, and buddha. Ten categories of the world. In each of the ten categories of existence has the rest of the ten categories of existence. Is that clear? It means hell is not only hell; hell has the hungry ghost, fighting spirit, and animal spirits, human beings, celestial beings, bodhisatvas, sravakas, pratekya buddhas and also buddhas world. So within hell, there is a Buddha. Even though the hell world, still there are bodhisatvas, sravakas, pratekyas, human beings, celestial beings – always. 

So from this point, wherever you may go, you have great opportunity to be saved. 

In one of the Chinese stories, you know the title of the storybook nobles in China is called Son Gokū, which means Monkey [King]. The monkey was very jealous of human beings, who can do everything. So he really wanted to do something more than human beings, so he started to practice asceticism, et cetera, or mysticism and magic, et cetera, and finally he got enormous power which allowed him to fly in the sky by his magic. Finally he tried to test where the end of the universe is. Then he flew through the universe and he reached the end of the universe because five ... right in front of him. And then he though, here it is, end of the universe; I have reached it. Immediately, the five poles fell down over the monkey. *[He laughs.]* And then crashed. And then he screamed, “Help, help!” And then from the sky, somebody said, “Who are you? Where are you going?” He said, “I am Monkey. I tried to test where is the end of the universe. Anyway, I have reached the end of the universe, so I put the mark bottom of the each five poles.” Immediately the five poles fell down and he couldn’t move an inch. And then he complains, “Help me. I want to go back to the human world.” And then the Buddha says, “Oh poor Monkey. Do you know where you are?” “I am at the end of the universe.” “Are you sure?” “Yes, I am sure! That’s why I put the marks here!” Then Buddha opened his hand. “This is my hand; it’s not the universe.” *[He laughs.]* Do you understand this? So whatever you do, wherever you may be, you are doing it in the Buddha’s world. Buddha’s world means the universe, anyway. The universe is nothing but the total manifestation of the truth, by which all sentient beings are supported, upheld, naturally. If you open your heart, okay? If you don’t open your heart, it’s a little bit difficult. Difficult means it takes a long time. But basically, still the universe and truth is very compassionate and kind toward all sentient beings. That’s why constantly give compassion, helping. Just like rain. Rain is accepted by many kinds of beings. But some of our plants grow, but some don’t grow. If you don’t open your heart, it’s pretty hard. Pretty hard means it really takes time. That’s it. But basically, still rain is rain. Rain is falling to support all sentient beings. 

So that is in terms of the functioning, Buddha refers to a person who consistently edifies all beings, whatever they may be. 

So, dharma means “he edifies, animates and inanimates beings by virtue of appearing as Buddha statues, as Buddha paintings, as statues of bodhisattvas, of Avalokiteshvaras, and Manjusris, and Samatabhadras, and who takes charge in the principle of existence and practice.” Avalokiteshvara is the symbol of a being who takes chan in wisdom and compassion and kindness. So statues of bodhisattvas, and Buddhist scriptures. So Buddha appears himself, Buddha manifests itself, truth manifests itself constantly, by virtue of appearing as a Buddha statue, and the painting of the Buddha, and the statues of bodhisattvas, and Buddhist scriptures written in words. Because it’s very difficult for human beings to have communion with the truth itself. It’s pretty hard. 

So very naturally human have kind of very deep feelings and sensations, which we try to make something, through which we can have very deep compassionate communion with the universe. That is the arts, Buddhistic arts, religious arts. That is the buddha statue. Buddha statue is not an idol; this is beautiful art. Art means manifestation of the perfect beauty coming from the human heart. *[Tape change.]*  ... This is the dharma. 

So from this point, not only the pictures and paintings and statues, but also the form of the trees, the color of the mountains, the sounds of the valley streams, all are teaching us, teaching the truth to us constantly. That’s why Dogen Zenji mentions the color of the mountains, the sounds of the valley [stream], all are the voice and the features of Buddha Shakyamuni, or truth. Or, Chinese poet says, “The sound of the valley streams are his long, broad tongue. The color of the mountains are his pure body. At night I heard the 84,000 verses uttered. How can I show others what they say?” 

The sangha means, in this case, saving all beings from their suffering, and free them the house of the three worlds. Sangha in terms of the functioning of the Triple Treasure refers to the save all beings from their suffering. And being free from the house of the Triple World – the house of the worldly affairs. This sangha means, in terms of the function of the Triple Treasure, the sangha in this case means the profound aspiration for letting all being be free from suffering, including subject and object. All sentient beings. Because generally, sangha means peace and harmony. 

So in terms of the function of the sangha, I think there must be something actualized by you. That is what? That something actualize by you, so-called activity or action, human behavior, it must last for a long time, not only in your lifetime, but life after life. This human action must last for long. So this action is based on ... In order to carry this refined human action for long, we need profound aspiration, so-called *vow*. For helping all sentient beings, for being free from suffering. No only you yourself individually – no.

Then simultaneously, this profound aspiration for letting all beings be free from suffering naturally turns into human action to build up the peaceful, harmonious, human world, so-called Buddha land. 

So, two aspects of refined human action based on the sangha. One is you have to carry constantly refined human action. What is this? That is to save or to help all sentient beings. In order to carry for long, we need profound aspiration, [which] means vow. And then, simultaneously, secondly, this human action based on vow shows itself as establishment of the Buddha land, where all beings can live in peace and harmony. Because you are constantly thinking and helping, practically, all sentient beings, in many ways. Not only one particular way; in many ways you can help. 

So, this is the sangha. 

So very naturally, you have to understand this Triple Treasure in terms of philosophical worth, and also the characteristics, so-called virtue, and the functioning of the Triple Treasure. So very naturally you can see a different image of the lofty, ideal image of human life. Towards that our effort should be directed. 

So very naturally, you can establish your life as whole, total personality, which is lofty, which is profound, and helping all sentient beings. Emotionally, philosophically, and morally, ethically, in many ways, you can help. Then, this is called Buddhist faith. 

Do you have questions? 

#### 54:23

**Question**: Roshi? What do you see as the goal of American society? 

**Katagiri**: American society and Japanese society and Phillipine society, wherever you may go, the most essential goals in life is the point I have mentioned. The goals in life I have mentioned are open to everywhere, anybody. Not only the particular race. 

**Same person**: I’d say the society is very different ...

**Katagiri**: But it doesn’t matter. The surface is different, anyway. *[He laughs.]* Japanese society is different from American society. American customs, habits, and mores of the American people are different from the Japanese, of course. But it is not good enough to understand the different mores, lifestyles of the human beings, but also you have to realize *the same and one ground* where different lifestyle of the beings exist. That is the most important thing. But usually we try to understand the different aspects, different styles, of race, human beings, and then we thing we can create peace. No. So you have to find the same and one ground, where the many, many different lifestyles of existence exist in peace and harmony. That is the point I mentioned. That is the Triple Treasure. 

Of course, we should understand what is the different. Japanese culture is different from American culture; Japanese are different from Americans. Yes, they are. But it’s not good enough. If you only understand the different lifestyles of beings, we’re always fighting. 

Even though I say, I try to teach something universal, beyond American or Japanese, but I am Japanese, so always people say, “You are Japanese, so you are talking about the Japanese Buddhism.” I’m not! *[He laughs.]* I am Japanese, of course, who is different from you. But I am trying to disclose universal lifestyle. 

Is that alright? 

#### 57:48

**Question**: Hojo-san? I heard you say toward the beginning something like, when human beings assert themselves, that’s egoistic. And I was wondering if you’re saying from your experience that being passive is egoless.

**Katagiri**: I’m not clear; would you say it again please?

**Same person**: I thought you said that when we’re assertive, that’s egoistic, so I wondered if you’re implying that being passive is egoless. 

**Katagiri**: Do you think egoless is passive? 

**Same person**: I wondered what you were thinking. *[Laughter.]*

**Katagiri**: No, not passive. *[He chuckles.]* Egoless is passive and positive. For instance, you cannot ignore the ego and egoless. You have both. It’s not real practice whether you should accept a style of ego, or a style of egolessness. No. It’s not important, alright? This is secondary. The important point is, first, how do you see humans – so-called Katagiri – as a whole? From where? From ego-style, or egoless-style? 

For instance, maybe I told you before, rose... No; rose is another example. But let’s see an example. For instance, if I get the flu, and then two persons try to see me. One person, A, says, “I don’t want to catch the flu from you, so please, don’t give a lecture today. You should sleep.” This is A person. B person says, “Well, you got the flu, so please take a rest. It’s not necessary to give a talk today, because you’re very tired; it’s not so good for you. So please take a rest.” And then what kind of world comes up between the two? Do you understand? 

Important point is not whether you should take ego or egolessness. The point is, how do you take care of one person, one reality, one event. In terms of where? Ego? Or egolessness? And then, quite a different world comes up. Do you understand?

Or if B person says, “Oh, poor Katagiri, please take a rest, because you got the flu, it’s very difficult for you to give a talk today.” That’s pretty nice. Because B person is completely practicing egolessness. But A person says, “I don’t want to catch the flu from you.” That means already... A person deals with other person in terms of his own standpoint. So always he’s attached to himself. This is really manifestation of ego. Don’t you think so? *[He laughs.]* So then, a different world comes up. Completely different. 

So very naturally, B and Katagiri can come together and also create a peaceful mood of circumstances. And then, everyone can get into this peaceful mode of circumstances. Naturally. 

That is called egolessness. So egolessness is not the idea of egolessness opposed to ego, because you cannot discuss always about egolessness and ego, which of the two are important. We cannot say, you know? *[He chuckles.]* We cannot always be practicing egolessness, because if you try to practice egolessness, immediately ego comes up, and so you can see always both. 

**Question**: It seems like on the same point, if someone is threatening violence, and A submits, that would be egoless, and B does not submit, or asserts some sort of defence, hence that might be ego coming up. But being egoless doesn’t necessarily create peace and harmony. 

**Katagiri**: Sometimes. But egolessness can accept whatever situation happens.

**Same person**: Egolessness is always acceptable?

**Katagiri**: It’s [accepting] all kinds of events which occur in the egolessness world can be acceptable. For instance Gandhi. How did he deal with events and circumstances, human beings? Everyone’s really violent, et cetera. But he saw both, violent or nonviolent. But he doesn’t always discuss, so which was should I accept, violent or nonviolent? No. Because completely he stands up beyond idea of violent or nonviolent. It means he is constantly standing in total nonviolence, beyond the idea of violent or nonviolent. 

In other words, if you see the rose, I say, “Oh! Rose is beautiful.” But be careful: there is a thorn, a terrible thorn. If I say, “Rose has a terrible thorn behind the beauty,” or you say, “Oh yes, rose has a thorn, but how beautiful the rose is.” What’s the difference [between] my life and your life? You’re standing completely beyond the idea of thorn, which is terrible, or beautiful rose. Beyond this. And then you completely actually deal with the rose which has two [aspects]: thorn and beauty, ugliness and beauty. Beyond this. You are always standing in total beauty. If you stand up in the beautiful world, you can deal with, you can create or establish a peaceful world, comes up. 

So the same applied to Gandhi. Gandhi always stood up in the perfect peaceful world, whatever happened. And then he can see human beings, violent, with a thorn, behind the beauty. But he doesn’t always argue. He’s constantly standing [in] how beautiful human beings are. That’s it. Is that clear? A quite different world comes up. 

So real peace is not discussion or idea of peace or not peace, or violent or not violent. You have to show real peace, or perfect non-violence. At that time, any kind of event which occurs in the realm of perfect nonviolence can be accepted by you. So finally, Gandhi was killed. But he forgave. That’s a martyr, in a deep sense. 

Maybe I can accept my death, but emotionally, I cannot accept death. *[He laughs.]* But as a whole, I can accept it. So part of my body, you know, my mind, consciousness, is screaming, “No, I don’t [accept death].” But as a whole, I can accept it. Because, [there is] no excuse. Not giving up, you know? 

Do you have more questions? *[He laughs.]* 

**Question**: [Sometime] I’ll have more questions.

**Katagiri**: Yes. *[He laughs, and the group laughs.]* 

But Gandhi’s example is very good for you. You can think of it. If you are Gandhi, what do you do? You have to think of that person.
