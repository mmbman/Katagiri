### Introduction

This is a song.

In Japanese we call it *Hôkyozammai*, "Jewel Mirror Awareness," omitting the word "Song." But Manzan, a famous Japanese Zen master, stressed that the title should include the word "Song." For this is not only a very important sutra: it is a song, one which is chanted every day in Soto Zen monasteries.

A song appeals very deeply to your heart, and impresses you very much. Even if you don't understand it. We learn songs as children, often singing them before we understand what the words mean, and as adults we still remember them.

This is why it is called the "Song of Jewel Mirror Awareness." "Awareness" of course means "samadhi." The Song of Jewel Mirror Samadhi.

So here we have a song which is also a very important sutra. You should recite it as well as study it, so that it becomes as much of you as a song of your childhood.

The *Song of Jewel Mirror Awareness* is a very simple sutra, consisting of 376 Chinese characters arranged into 94 phrases. It was written by the Zen Master Tozan, who lived from 807 to 865, and who is greatly respected as the founder of the Sotö tradition of Zen Buddhism. He also systematized the philosophical background of Soto Zen teaching into the so-called "Five Ranks."

<p align="center">* * *</p>

Tozan practiced under the guidance of Ungan. One day he was to leave his teacher and set out on a pilgrimage to other Zen temples. Before he left, Tozan asked Ungan:

"After you have passed away, how can I answer someone who asks me what you were like?"

Ungan replied, "Say to him, just this is." Ungan then went on to say, "You must now be very careful, as you are carrying this great thing. Consider it again and again."

Do you see what Ungan meant by "Just this is?"

Tozan went on his travels, always pondering this statement "Just this is." Then one day he was crossing a body of water and saw his image reflected there. Immediately he understood the teaching of Ungan, and composed the following gatha:

> You shouldn't search it outwardly  
> If you do, the truth will become more remote from you.  
> But when alone I proceed through myself,  
> Wherever I go I meet him.  
> Now he is not other than myself, yet I am not he.  
> Only if you understand this will you unite with the Tathägata.  

If you want to seek the truth you cannot search for it outwardly. If you do, the truth will become more and more remote from you. The more you conceptualize, the more you try to achieve objective and rational understanding, the more complex and distant the truth will become. But in fact the truth is really very simple.

Tozan realized this and understood Ungan's teaching when he saw his image in the water. A reflection. So he very naturally saw that the reflection was not himself, that there was something, Big Self, True Self, beyond the reflection in the water.

Who could this be?

"When alone I proceed through myself." When you walk alone, when there is really the truth, Big Self.

"Wherever I go, I meet him." So True Self meets that reflection wherever it goes. And, "He is not other than myself." So True Self and reflection cannot be separated. True Self does not float around like some kind of spirit or ghost. But, "I am not he." So there is more to us than the reflection that our senses perceive. But on the other hand, reflection must be there, or there is nothing for us to see.

So, wherever we may go, we see the reflection. And this leads people to believe that the reflection is their true selves.

That is a completely perverted view.

But that does not mean we can ignore that reflection. Reflection is not the truth, yet without the refection we cannot see the truth.

So where is real truth, True Self?

Outside, or inside of you?

Exactly neither.

Because if you say outside, then you are just seeking the truth outside of yourself, and it will get farther and farther away from you, become more and more conceptualized and artificial. If you say inside, you are still seeking the truth through your ordinary consciousness, objectively. What inside part of you is it?

Not "inside," not "outside." True Self is completely beyond our ability to discuss in words.

We can use language to create concepts and words, to see things objectively. When we think this way, we say that we understand, or that we know or don't know about something. But True Self exists completely outside any system of concepts. It is not something that we can capture in words and symbols.

It is something alive.

It is life itself, real life.

<p align="center">* * *</p>

You don't think consciously about your breath or the beating of our heart when you go to sleep. If you did, you would become very nervous; maybe even schizophrenic. Even though you sleep, your heart keeps on beating. But there is no guarantee that your heart will keep on beating. Because a beating heart is something that belongs to this limited world. There is uncertainty with each heartbeat, a kind of crisis. Because you don't know whether or not your heart is going to stop. So your heart exists within the limits of its own life, and also in a state of crisis.

What, then, is a beating heart?

Is it some kind of object that you can grasp? There is some kind of object there, but it is not a beating heart. If it were, then when your heart stopped you could pour heartbeats into it, like gasoline into a car. But you can't. So should we worry about each heartbeat when we go to bed? No, because we would go crazy.

What, then, is it?

It is the real truth, beyond your ability to put into words or concepts. Before a conscious thought arises or does not arise, your heart beats. From moment to moment your heart is alive. And something which is alive is something which is interconnected, interpenetrated with all sentient beings. "All sentient beings" means more beings, visible and invisible, than you can see with your eyes, smell with your nose, or grasp with your mind.

This is the real life of a beating heart.

The aliveness of life. Always interconnected, interpenetrated with all beings. This is completely beyond your thinking. Before you think or don't think, there is real life.

So then where is Big Self, True Self?

Inside or outside? No way.

If you say inside or outside you have used a word to represent an object separate from you. But before even the thought of that word there was something alive, a kind of impulse. After that impulse comes your thoughts and concepts and all the other objects you create in your life.

So there is something before thought.

Without that something, nothing can be created. We call it real life, Big Self, True Self. Only the True Self goes alone. That's why Tozan says, "When alone I proceed through myself."

Not just Tozan, everybody. I have to walk alone by myself, no matter what happens. This is not being egoistic; there is just no one who can substitute for me.

When it comes time for me to die, who can substitute for me?

No one. Even if you tried, it would be impossible. So all I have to do is to just go ahead and die. Even though I scream, or laugh, or cry, no matter what I say or do, I must proceed alone into death.

Together with the whole world.

<p align="center">* * *</p>

When a dying Buddhist comes to a Zen master and asks for some words of sympathy and relief, the Zen master will say, "please, go ahead, quietly."

That means, when you have to die, just go ahead and die, quietly. It seems cold, but it is very true. The Zen master understands pretty well what life and death are. So "alone I proceed through myself." "Through myself" means through this body, right here, right now. Why this body? Because there is no other choice.

Wherever I may go, I meet this reflection. He is completely myself but simultaneously he is not me. But only the True Self is going along. Yet the reflection is what we discuss, what we stumble over all the time. So we say this is me, this is you; but it is not you, and it is not I.

"Only if you understand this will you unite with the Tathagata." "This" means Big Self, True Self. "Tathagata" comes from two words, "Tatha," meaning "going," and "agata," meaning "coming;" so it means something that is going and coming. That is the truth, the vastness of existence. Before your thought or feelings, there is something there: the vastness of existence.

Is this vastness of existence then nothing? We call it "emptiness," but there is something there. It is always coming, and it is always going. So when you see the reflection it is coming but in the next moment it is going. When the reflection is gone, you say "this is not me;" but immediately the reflection comes.

So without this reflection I cannot exist, I cannot understand who I am. But that reflection is always coming and going; it does not stay even for a moment. The only thing that stays is the vastness of existence. That is called truth, or in Japanese, "hokyo:" the Jewel Mirror.

Manzan said that the Jewel Mirror was a metaphor for wisdom, and that he took great pity on those who did not realize wisdom; the greatest sadness in the world was not to realize wisdom.

This wisdom is not a matter of words and discussion. This wisdom is the truth, Big Self, the Real Self.

When I alone proceed through myself, then there is wisdom.

If you think about it, proceeding alone is very hard. Because no one can really reach you or help you. We can communicate by means of language, send each other words of sympathy and encouragement. But no matter what words you send me, I alone proceed through myself. It is very hard to stay there, with aloneness.

But there is no other way. Whatever you say, whatever opinion you have, you have to just proceed alone through yourself within this world. When you let your True Self proceed, this proceeding is called wisdom.

Wisdom is not a matter of philosophical discussion. Wisdom constantly shows us the real principle of human life.

We can call this principle of existence what we want: Truth, Buddha, Dharmakaya, whatever. But any kind of concept must be personalized. You must experience it. At that time it becomes wisdom.

So the realization of the principle of existence is wisdom, a very deep understanding of the human world, which no one can ignore.

Wisdom lets you look with depth and penetration into the the core of human existence, and simultaneously guides you in your practice. Without practice, wisdom doesn't make sense.

The practice of wisdom is the practice of samadhi. One-pointedness. And the simplest practice of samadhi is Zazen.

<p align="center">* * *</p>

Buddhism, and particularly the Prajna Paramita Sutra, places great stress on the Wisdom of Emptiness. Wisdom of Emptiness is the realization that the human world has no substantiality of its own.

No substantiality of its own means that there is no single thing to pin down, to count, to explain, to know, or to understand as an independent entity.

But you can be there. Just be; that is the Wisdom of Emptiness, emphasized so much in the Prajna Paramita.

<p align="center">* * *</p>

There are three aspects to the Wisdom of Emptiness: Emptiness of the Conditioned, the Emptiness of the Unconditioned, and Ultimate Emptiness.

Emptiness of the Conditioned means emptiness of the phenomenal world.

The human world.

What you see, what you hear, what you think and experience, all things visible and invisible. All sentient beings.

What you see through your six senses is constantly changing. So there is nothing to pin down.

So does your heart beat because of your efforts? Yes, it does. But on the other hand, it does not.

It does, because if you don't take care of your health, pretty soon there will be no more heartbeats. It does not, because your heart beats or doesn't beat no matter what you think.

But that shouldn't cause you to ignore your heart. You should appreciate it, and take good care of your health. Because each heartbeat is an indication of your existence. Totally interconnected, interpenetrated with all other sentient beings.

We don't know what a heartbeat is, but our heart beats anyway. As a whole, before you think or do not think. This is the life of a beating heart.

Now when I use the term "life," I don't mean just life in the biological sense, or what some people call "life force." I mean something more than that. I mean that impulse which makes something exist, right in the middle of emptiness. So everything has a life. Trees, birds, rocks, this table, everything. And this life is impermanent.

One Japanese alphabet, Hirakana, is made up of fourty-seven syllables. Kobo Daishi, the founder of Esoteric Buddhism in Japan, took these syllables and made a poem by grouping them into words:

> Though flowers bloom, they soon fall.  
> How can this life be permanent to anyone?  
> Crossing the mountains of life's vicissitudes today, 
> We shall not have light dreams or be infatuated again.

So even first grade children, by repeating their alphabet, are saying this poem. Even before they learn the meaning of the words. So when you grow up with the Japanese language you very naturally experience the emptiness of the world. Emptiness in the sense that everything is constantly moving, functioning dynamically, constantly working.

So there is nothing to grasp.

But it is not pessimistic. Reading a poem like this naturally makes you somewhat pensive and sad; but this sadness results from your looking at life as a kind of object that you want to hold on to. If you see your life exactly as it is then there is no way to feel pensive. Because your life is constantly emerging. You have to take care of it, every day, no matter what happens. You have to move forward; deal with life and let it pass by, and not let yourself be dragged around by your ideas and thoughts.

Ideas and thoughts are important, but they should come from this emptiness of life, this dynamic function of life. In other words, first you should be alive. Then you should think and create ideas and concepts. Usually we do it the other way around. And so we are dragged around by our ideas, and the result is all the crying and laughing and screaming and fighting that we see around us.

So that pensiveness or sadness we get from much of Japanese literature is normal. But don't think that you can realize the impermanence of life by reading novels. Impermanence is something more serious than that. It is something you must taste directly, in your own life.

<p align="center">* * *</p>

So that is the Emptiness of the Conditioned. The second aspect of the Wisdom of Emptiness is the Emptiness of the Unconditioned.

When I say "Unconditioned" I mean the experience of the truth, sometimes called spiritual fascination or ecstasy. If you practice the spiritual life and practice it hard, sooner or later you will experience something of the truth. Then you may attach to this experience and try to hold on to it. But in fact that : experience is empty just like anything else. Constantly changing, constantly coming and going, with nothing to grasp.

That is why Manzan said that Zen with no wisdom gives rise to the demons of meditation. This means that you can become crazed by zazen or by enlightenment.

In the Zazen Yojinki the Zen master Keizan describes the experience of the demons of meditation. He says:

> "When sitting in meditation, your body may seem hot or cold, uneasy or comfortable, sometimes stiff, sometimes loose, sometimes heavy, sometimes light, sometimes startled awake."

Have you experienced that?

Even though it is winter, if you do zazen very seriously you become warm. Sometimes your body is very dull, sometimes it is very sharp. Very sensitive. Sometimes you sit there just like a rock. Other times you are soft, just like a jellyfish.

If you sit down in the ordinary way, just to relax, then this may trigger the demons of meditation. If you feel them, or your body feels overly irritable, you should check your breathing.

It is very important to breathe harmoniously during zazen. To harmonize your breathing, just open your mouth for a while and breathe through it. If a short breath comes, breathe short; if long breath comes, breathe long. Wisely harmonize your breathing and follow it naturally. When the timing comes easy and natural, shift your breathing to your nose. When breathing and mind are not coordinated, then zazen sickness arises.

For example, you feel like your body is sinking to the bottom of the ocean, or shrinking down to the size of a tiny insect. Or you feel your body becoming huge and what you're looking at becomes very small. Sometimes your body feels very insubstantial, like a fog; sometimes your body and mind becomes very sharp and attentive. If a pin dropped outside you could hear it.

Sometimes you will experience supernatural powers. Even though Buddhist teaching talks about the six supernatural powers, if you attach to them then they just become zazen sickness. You think you can travel inside your body. You can hear your heart very clearly, or touch your nerves, or hear sounds at the corner of your head. Sounds of people talking about something. You don't want to hear it, but you can. So in a sense your mind has become very sharp and sensitive.

Maybe you see a beautiful image of the Buddha, or a Bodhisattva. Sometimes you see light, all different colors, sometimes silver or gold. Or you look at a little dot on the floor and it looks like a lion's head, or a human body. And then these things give birth to corrupting thoughts. You think, "Oh, my thoughts have stopped now!"

Other times, when you are just sitting and your mind is very clear, the meaning of some difficult passage in a Sutra comes up even though you are not thinking about it. This is very natural. When water is very still, even tiny things become very conspicuous. On the surface of a serene pond, even a tiny bubble is clearly visible. When the surface is rough and stirred up, you cannot see it. So naturally when you do zazen you can see many things.

Sometimes people bring along paper and pencil and try to take notes of these thoughts. They are afraid they will forget. That makes zazen a part-time job.

Zazen is not a part-time job. So leave the paper and pencil behind. If it is important, you won't forget it. It remains with you, and some day it will come up. And if it disappears after zazen, well, that's all right too. For it's already gone.

When you have these symptoms it means your mind and breathing are not in harmony, or you are trying to use zazen to achieve some kind of object. Which is why Menzan said that Zen without wisdom gives rise to the demons of meditation.

So whatever you see during zazen, even spiritual ecstasy, or enlightenment, or Buddha's face, whatever, it's just emptiness. The Emptiness of the Unconditioned. You have to let it go.

Let it be.

If you touch it, it is no longer the Unconditioned. It's something you have created. You have made the Unconditioned into the Conditioned. If you experience the Unconditioned, that's fine. But let it be.

<p align="center">* * *</p>

So that is the second aspect, the Wisdom of the Unconditioned. The third is the Ultimate Emptiness.

Ultimate Emptiness means being completely without attachment to anything.

Even Zen.

Just proceed through yourself, alone. It's very simple to describe, but it's very hard to practice this way. It is very easy for us to attach to the conditioned or the unconditioned world. Especially the unconditioned world, because it is mysterious. We are always curious about mysteries.

Occasionally people will say, "Katagiri is fine, but Katagiri is not the best teacher." And then they will compare me to some other teacher, who is supposed to be able to walk on air. His body touches the floor but he doesn't touch the floor, he just walks on air.

It sounds fantastic, but I am not interested. Other people may be curious, but it is just the Emptiness of the Unconditioned. If you grasp something like this and try to hold it, it just becomes delusion.

So all you have to do, completely beyond Conditioned or Unconditioned, is just proceed. By yourself. That is a very simple practice, but it is very hard. Wherever you may go, this alone is the way we all experience the Ultimate Emptiness. A very good example is life and death, which is why life and death is the most important problem in Zen.

In the Ultimate Emptiness, there are no ideas or concepts, even of Emptiness. If you say "Emptiness," then you have created an element of the Conditioned world. Or if you say "Emptiness is Nothing, " you have also created a Conditioned element.

Ultimate Emptiness means just walk.

Proceed with your practice, straight, without going this way or that.

So, right now, just go.

Next moment, just go.

Next moment, just go your way.

It's very simple, but it is very hard, to let wisdom guide you and to act. Very hard.

But when you do gassho, just gassho. When you die, just die. When you live, just live. It's very simple.

But we don't understand it. And we don't understand how our understanding is perverted. And we don't understand that simple way of life, to just go in the realm of emptiness.

And so we become confused and carried away by our ignorance.

Ignorance means you don't understand what's going on here. You don't understand why you are here, or why you are doing zazen. That is called ignorance. Ignorant people are always in a hurry. How can they do anything in a proper way? How can they live without causing trouble and confusion?

We don't know where this ignorance comes from.

You can say your parents, but that is just a probable reason. We don't really know.

Why am I Japanese?

One time I spoke in Chicago. I was just sitting there on the top floor, waiting for questions, and this young American woman asked me why my mouth was just like one line.

It was pretty hard to answer, because I hadn't created it on purpose.

So I just said, "Why were you born an American?"

Speaking is really very interesting. It is one of the ways I hope to avoid ignorance, by poking away into every nook and cranny, just like a cat.

<p align="center">* * *</p>

So Ultimate Emptiness is exactly what you can do, in the simplest way, from moment to moment. At that time you can experience it. Beyond your idea of experience, it is the true experience.

Because we are really walking in the mist.

Wisdom, Truth, Big Self, whatever you say and whatever I say, everything becomes a mist.

I say your life is just you, no one helping. You don't understand what this Big Self is; if you try to grasp it, it becomes just like a mist.

Even though I say that your life is pretty good, that you have success, and will become a great person, that too is like a mist.

Because our life goes on in this limited world, and each moment is a kind of crisis; we never know when it all may be destroyed, ruined, when we die.

Worldly possessions, success and failure, social status are all like a mist.

You cannot ignore success and failure, but you can experience it as something insubstantial, like a mist. And as Dogen Zenji said, when you walk in the mist, before you are conscious of it, your clothes become wet. So before anything you think of as an experience, you experience the Ultimate Emptiness.

What you experience is wisdom. So wisdom is really not something we discuss, wisdom is something we manifest. When we walk in the mist. And when wisdom becomes actualized it is called Samadhi.

So samadhi means right acceptance. Right acceptance is not opposed to wrong acceptance. Wrong acceptance means to accept something dualistically, like it is an object outside of you, something you can create and hold. At that time there is wrong acceptance, because you cannot really create and hold onto any of these things: fame, or health, or happiness.

But we try. We exercise every day, to get healthy. And we do everything with this object in mind of making our life happy or good. We do yoga exercises and zazen exercises, and we study, and master some skill or another, and make money, always with some outside object in mind. And then we believe that this is the best way to live.

I don't think so.

Because when you die you lose all these objects and you become very unhappy.

So what we should do is just walk.

This is called samadhi. Samadhi is right acceptance; accepting something, but not from the dualistic point of view.

Completely beyond like or don't like or feel so-so, you alone proceed through yourself. Interconnected, interpenetrated, with all sentient beings. Just do whatever you do at that moment with whole heart, true heart.

This is called, "you alone proceed."

This is samadhi.

Zazen is a very simple manifestation of this samadhi.

This is why we do zazen.

Now I don't think anybody really likes zazen, particularly during sesshin. If you don't like zazen, then why don't you quit? But you tell me you cannot quit. So it is something beyond like or dislike. You accept zazen totally, as a whole.

Another aspect of right acceptance is accepting yourself without competing with others. If you are Katagiri, just be Katagiri as he is, without comparison to others.

If I am a violet all I have to do is wait for the violet to bloom. I don't have to imitate a rose. I am a violet all by myself. No one helps me, and there is no one to imitate.

Then maybe you say, which will I be, a violet or a rose? That is already making comparisons, and I am not talking about comparisons.

You are already something. Before you compare yourself with somebody else, you are already you. All you have to do is let the flow of your life force to cause you to bloom as you really are.

In the Tenzo Kyokun, by Dogen Zenji, we find the passage:

> "Put those things that naturally go on a high place onto a high place, and those that would be most stable on a low place onto a low place; things that naturally belong on a high place settle best on a high place, while those that belong on a low place find their greatest stability there."

This is a very important passage; you should consider it again and again.

If you go to work for a company, the company will do many things to get your life force to bloom. But if you are a violet, they will tell you not to bloom as a Violet but to bloom as a rose. So they will do things like put up lists of who is the best salesman or some such thing.

That's pretty nice, in a sense, because it seems to be encouragement. But encouragement is not always good for you. If it makes you see the world dualistically, then it makes you nervous. You can accept your life when things are going well. But when things are not going well you become very depressed.
Nervous. Sick. You can die from it.

That's why you can look around and see so many nervous people. Even when they have money and high social status, and what appears to be a very nice life. Because they are really violets and they are trying to bloom like roses.

So something which belongs on a high place should be in a high place and something that belongs on a low place should be on a low one. "High" and "low" do not mean rank or status. They just mean different places. So this means Katagiri is Katagiri.

No one can imitate the way I speak as a teacher, no one can follow me in life, no one can help me in the basic things like facing death. That's why we understand each other: I cannot help you and you cannot help me.

If we could truly help each other, no one would have to die. But whatever we do, we have to die. And so we can be sympathetic with each other. The Buddha said:

> Who do I love best in this world?
> 
> I love myself best in this world.

This is true of everyone, don't you think?

I can say that I will help all sentient beings, but I cannot really trust myself to do that. I always like myself best.
Particularly in a dangerous situation. Even in a case where my wife and children are in the middle of the ocean, can I trust myself to help my wife first?

I cannot say so.

Because I know myself how egoistic I am.

That's why we must be sympathetic. That's why the Buddha said, if everyone likes himself best in this whole world, then don't hurt others.

That's a very good saying. You like yourself, 1 like myself, so why do I have to hurt you? Why do we have all this killing in this world?

So put up something which should be on a high place and put something which should be on a low place down where it ought to be. That's very natural.

So when I look at myself, sometimes I feel good and sometimes I don't feel good, because everything in life is up and down. But there is no way to escape this up and down. So basically I must Just accept, just stand up and proceed. With stability. By myself.

Then I can experience up and down, and take care of it. If I don't proceed by myself, stably, how can I survive an up and down life? And so you should read this passage in the Tenzo Kyokan, and consider it again and again.

### Part 1

> The teaching of thusness  
> Has been intimately communicated by buddhas and patriarchs;  
> Now you have it,  
> So keep it well.  

In Japanese we use the word "nyoze" for "thusness." The word is made up of two syllables, "nyo" and "ze." "Nyo" means thus, or like, or likeness; "ze" means this, or something affirmative or assenting. Nyo can be taken to stand for the ultimate principle, and ze for the phenomenal world: thusness and thisness. Taken together they mean principle and practice. In English we say "thusness" or "suchness," but you should think of it as principle and practice, ultimate principle and phenomena.

We combine them in one word because they are not separate.

Principle cannot exist alone, separate from practice. If it did, it would be like a dead tree: it would not live. So when you say principle, there must be practice; when you say practice there must be principle.

Even though you don't actually say the second word.

Then practice does not become the practice of something with blind or ignorant mind. Practice requires that you polish your mind through and through.

So we have "The teaching of nyoze." "Teaching," is, of course, "dharma." Dharma has to be understood in three ways: as the ultimate principle, as phenomena, and as teaching. You may also understand dharma in terms of its working, as perfect harmony.

In terms of a purely intellectual understanding you can describe dharma as principle and phenomena, and analyze it in terms of parts. But in reality they are not separate; they must be completely harmonized.

Interconnected, interpenetrated, in perfect harmony.

Then teaching must focus constantly on this perfect harmony of ultimate principle and phenomenal world. It cannot just be something written or spoken, or something conceptualized. It must be alive. It must remove suffering, and awaken people to the truth.

It must be something you manifest with your mind and your body as well as your mouth. Even without speaking, you can teach with your whole body the perfect harmony of ultimate truth and the phenomenal world.

That is why your behavior on a daily basis is so important. As is your talking. And your silence.

Silence teaches a lot.

If you don't completely understand the meaning of the human world, then you should keep your mouth shut and contemplate. If you keep your mouth shut you will find that you can naturally go very deeply into the human world.

That is our practice.

Being silent does not mean being isolated from the human world. You should go very deeply into the human world; that is silence. Getting deeply into the human heart; this is silence.

So silence, human bodies, human words, all teach.

This is the dharma.

Generally speaking you should probably understand the dharma in terms of its working, as harmony. But this is still just a philosophical understanding.

You have to put it into practice in your daily living.

You cannot talk about truth separate from the human world; if you try, your life gets farther and farther away from everyday living and eventually you become crazy.

On the other hand, if you ignore the ultimate principle and concentrate on everyday living, your life becomes very cold, without meaning.

Very shallow.

You can make a lot of fancy noises and make your life very exciting, but it is very shallow. You will feel an uneasiness at the bottom of your life. Even though apparently you are very happy and leading a very fancy life, at the very bottom there will be a definite uneasiness.

So you need thusness and thisness, principle and practice, truth and the phenomenal world; both working in harmony.

This is dharma.

<p align="center">* * *</p>

Dharma is the object of belief for Buddhists. It is not an object of analysis, or philosophical or psychological discussion; it is something to realize through your life. A person who makes the dharma real, manifests the dharma through their life, is called a buddha.

A patriarch is a descendant, one who has received the teachings of a buddha. So each of us is a patriarch. And if you are a patriarch, and you become qualified to teach future generations, then you become a buddha. A buddha understands how important his life is and also lets other people realize how important their lives are, by transmitting the teaching to the next generation.

If you are not a buddha, you cannot teach. If you receive the teaching of a buddha, then you are a patriarch. If you become able to transmit Buddha's teaching to the next generation, then you become buddha. Such buddha-patriarchs are bestowed with the perfect harmony of truth and phenomenal world.

Principle and practice.

They understand the world very deeply, with more than just a scientific understanding. And they practice this understanding through their lives, so that principle and practice becomes one.

And then they intimately communicate.

Intimately: A state of uncoveredness. The dharma is with you so closely that you cannot create a gap between the phenomenal world and the truth, you cannot separate them to even the slightest degree. If you have very intimate communication, it's very difficult to separate the two parties, to make a space between them. Oh, intellectually you can do so, you can say that this is one and that is the other. But actually the relationship is beyond this and that, one and the other, good and bad. There is no boundary. This kind of intimacy is very important in Buddhism, especially in Zen Buddhism.

To communicate or transmit: Although we are already buddha, we must be led to attain the buddha by someone who has already attained; the way to attain must be taught and we must follow that teaching.

Otherwise, although we are buddha, we will fail to manifest the buddha.

If you want your life to work perfectly and peacefully, you have to understand yourself and others and all sentient beings, the visible and the invisble, and you have to accept. Whether you like something or you don't like it, intellectually or emotionally, you have to completely accept it.

This is not only true of your life, it is also true of other's lives as well.

So then what is your life?

Your life is the entire whole world. Dogen Zenji said: the self is the entire whole world, which is one bright pearl. This is what I mean when I say you are buddha: that you are the entire whole world, which is one bright pearl. Same is true of your book, even the smallest pebble. It is its entire whole world, because there is nothing to compare it to, no way to discriminate between it and something else.

But if you are already buddha, why must you practice?

In order to manifest your buddha, to make it alive in your life, to attain the buddha way.

It is like a golden statue of Buddha. Every part of the statue, nose, ears, everything, is exactly gold. But it is not Buddha until the gold has been poured into a mold, so that the nose in the gold becomes a nose, and the ears in the gold become ears. Then the Buddha is manifested, realized, and made alive.

How do we do this?

Under the guidance of a person who has realized buddha. A teacher. And if you practice under the guidance of the teacher as buddha, you become exactly buddha, just as this teacher who has attained.

At that time teacher will intimately communicate the dharma of nyoze. And you will intimately receive it. And then you must completely follow it, practice it, and make it alive in your life. That means you must put yourself in the same way of life as the person who has attained the buddha.

It is just like learning calligraphy. If you want to learn calligraphy under a teacher, you are first taught to write using a textbook. First you receive and accept the textbook, because it is part of the teaching of your teacher. Then the teacher tells you exactly how to hold the brush. Next, you exactly follow the textbook and the the teacher's way.

Whether you like it or not.

There will be times when you read the teacher's textbook and observe the teacher's examples; but when you try to write, your calligraphy will be far from your teacher's way.

And immediately he will say that he does not like it.

If you refuse to accept this criticism, and refuse to accept the teacher's way, then you will never master calligraphy to the degree your teacher has. So you must completely follow his way.

This is egolessness. And the practice of egolessness is very hard.

Finally your calligraphy becomes exactly the same as your teacher's. And then you must go beyond your teacher, and cause your own style of calligraphy to bloom and grow. Unless you go beyond, your calligraphy will always be nothing but an imitation of the teacher's style.

Do you understand?

People always are saying "my way," I want to create "my way" of life.

Well, that's fine. But without perfectly following the teacher's way and becoming one with that way, you cannot really create your life.

You have to practice for many, many years. You have to mold yourself, like the golden Buddha statue, in the way of life demonstrated by your teacher. In order to manifest your buddha.

Do you know how to attain the buddha?

No, you don't. But your teacher knows. Buddhas know. So that's why you have to follow his teaching.

I am told that in Japan, when thread is dyed in the traditional manner, the white thread is dipped into the dye and then pressed and dried, over and over again. When you dip it first into the dye it looks as if it were fully colored, but when you press it, the color seems to leave it. But not all; a little bit is left.
Then you dip it again and press it again and finally after many times, the thread is dyed through and through. And then no matter what kind of cloth you weave it into, no matter how badly it is worn or damaged, the color is always there.

Same is true of buddha nature. It is like the color of the thread, or the gold of the golden Buddha statue. But you must mold it, or weave it into cloth before it is manifest. So you practice again and again, until you become exactly the same as your teacher, exactly the same as a buddha.

<p align="center">* * *</p>

I went to Japan to visit Narazaki Roshi, who is the abbot of a monastery called Zuioji. His brother is also at that monastery. Both of them had practiced for many years under the famous Zen master Hashimoto Roshi, whom I knew very well.

After I had stayed at Zuioji for a little while I was surprised to notice that the abbot's behavior was exactly the same as Hashimoto Roshi's. Walking style, talking style, voice, calligraphy: exactly the same.

But he is not Hashimoto Roshi, he is Narazaki Roshi. He is himself, but his way has become that of his teacher. Now his life is really blooming. And everybody respects him, because he has attained Hashimoto Roshi's way. They are not respecting Hashimoto Roshi, they are respecting Narazaki Roshi.

<p align="center">* * *</p>

If you want to learn the tea ceremony you have to practice again and again exactly as the teacher tells you; your behavior, your attitude, your understanding must be exactly the same as that of you teacher. Finally, the teacher knows the time or opportunity when he or she has to transmit the real teaching of the ceremony.
At that time, the teacher transmits the secret key point of how to deal with the tea ceremony.

We call that the dharma transmission.

The perfect harmony is transmitted from one to another, from me to you. But perfect harmony is not something I give; you are already perfect harmony. You yourself are already the perfect harmonious working of the whole world. You already have this, but you don't know how to manifest it; this is why we have to practice. And then when the time is right and the conditions arranged, the perfect harmonious working of the whole world is manifested.

This is the dharma transmission.

So Tozan tells us "now you have it." That means you have it at this very instant; but you must manifest it. And then he tells us, "keep it well." Keep it well; take good care of it.
Manifest the perfect harmony in your life under the guidance of a buddha, keep it, preserve it by receiving it and transmitting it to others.

Do not give up to despair or self-neglect.

Or destroy the indescribable, distinctive, peculiar flavor of your life.

This peculiar flavor is called the Dharmakaya buddha, or the dharma body. It is the same as the ultimate principle; it is what I refer to when I say you are already buddha.

That is the seed. Everyone's body and mind are the seed. Everyone has the seed and everyone deserves to let it grow, and blossom, and bear fruit. The fruit is called the Sambhogakaya buddha.

Samboghakaya buddha is something between Dharmakaya buddha and what is called Nirmanakaya buddha, which is the physical world we can sense.

So if you have this seed, where can it grow?

In an appropriate place. And that is your body. Your body and your mind and your whole circumstance: sunsets, sunrises, warmth, cold, everything visible and invisible. That is Nirmanakaya buddha.

And then your seed grows, in peace and harmony, interconnected, interpenetrated with all sentient beings. That is the dharma of perfect harmony of truth and phenomenal world.

If you put the seed in an inappropriate place then the seed doesn't grow. So you have to put the seed in an appropriate place, one where there is harmony between the truth and the phenomenal world. And then the seed will grow and bear fruit: Samboghokaya buddha, something between the seed of Dharmakaya buddha and the circumstance of Nirmanakaya buddha. Warmth, cold, everything works together and contributes to the growing of the seed into fruit.

And that fruit will have its own peculiar, incredible, indescribable flavor.

Pumpkins, bananas, apples, oranges: every fruit has its own particular, peculiar flavor.

You cannot describe it in words.

Each individual orange has a different flavor, according to the place in which it grew, the sunrises, the sunsets, the different warmth of the sun; all different.

You know, it is very convenient for us to have vegetables during the winter, so we grow them in the greenhouse. But those vegetables are not so delicious; a vegetable has to go through severe winter, very hot summer, spring and autumn. And when it grows that way, naturally, then it has incredible, indescribable, peculiar flavor.

So regardless of whether you like your circumstances or not, try to keep it well. And also your circumstances, your bodies, your minds are constantly changing. So you have to learn how to keep it well.

This is our practice.

This is why in one of the precepts it states: no killing.

Bodhidharma explained it this way: in accordance with refraining from taking life, a buddha seed grows to achieve continuity of the Buddha's wisdom.

To achieve continuity of the Buddha's wisdom means to achieve continuity of keeping the perfect harmony of the whole universe, truth and phenomena. If we kill we break that continuity; and so we should refrain from taking life.

In any event, regardless of whether you know it or not, you have already been taught by Buddha. This is why we say you are buddha. You know, even if just intellectually, that you are buddha. This is why Tozan tells you that you have it at this very moment, and urges you to keep it well.

> Filling a silver bowl with snow,  
> Hiding a heron in moonlight --  
> When you array them, they're not the same;  
> When you mix them, you know where they are.  

How can you keep it well?

Tozan says: "Filling a silver bowl with snow."

Snow is each of us. Silver bowl is Buddha, your teacher, Buddha's teachings.

So you should put yourself in the silver bowl, Buddha's bowl.
Silver and snow are the same color, but they are different. So when you put yourself in the Buddha's bowl, there is no gap between you and it. You are buddha, and Buddha is buddha. That is how to keep it well.

If you try to always judge yourself in terms of your own understanding and your own feelings, then it is difficult to put yourself in the silver bowl, because you feel so conspicuous, there in the Buddha bowl.

At that time you are not keeping it well.

Keep it well means to let the seed of the buddha nature grow. And to do this you must continually put yourself in the Buddha bowl. That is what is meant by the practice of egolessness: to put snow in a silver bowl.

That's why Tozan tells us at the end of this sutra: Practice secretly, working within, as though a fool, like an idiot -- if you can achieve continuity, this is called the host within the host.

This is the best way.

You become host within the host, in whatever situation you may be in. You become the host, but you become something more than the host, because you can create your own life. So it is not the practice of imitation. That is what is meant by filling a silver bowl with snow, hiding a heron in moonlight.

Dogen Zenji wrote:

> A snowy heron on the snow field  
> Where winter grass is unseen  
> Hides itself in its own figure.  

This is our practice.

Filling a silver bowl with snow, hiding a heron in moonlight.

Put yourself in the silver bowl, put yourself in a certain pattern of the Buddha way of life. This does not mean that you should be hidden behind the Buddha's way of life, or that you should imitate. It means that your practice should be like the snowy heron, that hides itself in its own figure. You are already white like the snow, which means that you are already buddha nature. When you put yourself in the silver bowl, then there is growth. But it doesn't show conspicously; it is difficult to distinguish, like the difference between snow and silver.

That is why Tozan goes on to say: When you array them, they're not the same; when you mix them, you know where they are.

A heron has long legs, a chicken has very short legs. Katagiri is short man and Don here is very tall man. So there is a difference. But the difference doesn't matter. Snowy heron is a heron, snow is snow. The difference is there, but it is not fundamental.

When you mix them you know where they are. "Mix" is not really the word; they do not mix like paint. When you see them together you know which is which.

You are you, Buddha bowl is Buddha bowl, silver is silver. There is a difference. When you throw yourself into the Buddha way and practice it, it's not mixed up. It's not a combination. It's not fused. You are you, Buddha is Buddha.

If we lose sight of this then very naturally we feel that practice means losing our own particular life-style and personality. It's not like that at all. Buddhist training is not like Army training, or brainwashing. The heron still has its own figure.

> The meaning is not in the words,  
> Yet it responds to the inquiring impulse.  

"Meaning" here refers to the real dharma, something behind the song; the real meaning. So the dharma which has been transmitted is more than words. Yet it responds to the inquiring impulse --if you look for it you can find it. There is an interacting communication, a communion, between the snow and the silver bowl, the snowy heron and the snowy world. And that communion is completely beyond words and language.

There is a very famous story of Rinzai, or Lin Chi in Chinese, told in the Record of Lin Chi. Rinzai said: "The true man without rank is going and coming through your nose and eyes and ears; if you don't know this yet, look." A monk came up to him and said, what is the true man without rank? Rinzai immediately grasped the monk and shook him, saying "Speak! Speak!"

This means that buddha nature, true man, True Self, is not something a Zen Master gives or a monk receives. True man is already in everybody, manifesting perfect harmony of whole universe.

You are whole universe, and you are perfect harmony; that's why you are alive.

Perfect harmony with what? Whole universe, including truth; all things visible and invisble. The whole universe comes together and harmonizes in your life. Supports your life. This is called the true man.

And then Rinzai got up from his seat and grasped the monk and shook him, saying "Speak! Speak!"

"Speak!" means here you are; here buddha is.

And then the monk said "Oh! Oh!"

He was too rattled to speak, and he completely lost the chance to say something; all he could say was "Oh!"

"Oh!" means "Oh! I am buddha;" means he realized, "Oh! I am buddha." Completely beyond the word. Rinzai said "Speak!" and the monk realized, "Oh!" And he accepted himself as buddha.

It is like when you see the beautiful flower. At that moment you cannot say anything; just "Wow!, " that's all. It is beautiful beyond all words. So you just accept.

Wow.

When you say "Wow!, " you completely accept the whole world.

And then after the monk said "Oh!," Rinzai pushed him away and left.

This gesture meant that just accepting is not good enough. We say, don't stay on the chair of the Buddha. This means you have to go beyond realization, you have to live. You cannot stay on the chair of just saying "Oh!"

Do you understand this?

Even though you realize how beautiful the human world is, you cannot spend every day saying "Wow! Beautiful! Beautiful!," or your life will be completely up in the air.

For morning will come and you will have to get up. Evening will come and you will have to go to sleep.
You cannot just say "Wow!" Right in the middle of the "Wow!" you have to go beyond this and make it alive in your life.

Which is why Rinzai pushed the monk away and left.

This is the great teaching given by Rinzai, a teaching completely beyond words. You can read it in the Record of Lin Chi, Number Three.

> If you're excited, it becomes a pitfall;  
> If you miss it you fall into retrospective hesitation.  

If you say "I attained enlightenment," then immediately you fall into the pitfall. Or if you say "I am a good boy, " you fall into the pitfall. Because when you say "I" understand "it" you have fallen into the pitfall of dualism, and you lack understanding of the self. You ignore the unity of subject and object. And then, excited or not excited, you are in the pitfall.

But if you miss it, miss the important point of life, then you fall into retrospective hesitation. You don't know which way to go. The way to go is very clear every day, but if you miss the important point of life, you are paralyzed by hesitation.

If you are completely dragged away by your thoughts, by like or dislike, then you hesitate and you cannot get into the depth of the Buddha way.

But if you understand the most important point, and you treat it as something outside yourself, some kind of stimulus, then you become excited and you make your own pitfall. And you cannot move an inch there.

So if you truly realize this most important point, the perfect harmony of your life interconnected, interpenetrated with the lives of all sentient beings, then you can make it alive. Beyond words, beyond excitement or non-excitement, despair or negation or self-affirmation. You can make your life truly alive. And that is how you keep it well. Nothing but the achievement of continuity of just quiet practice. It is quiet, but it is active; very active.

> Turning away and touching are both wrong,  
> For it is like a mass of fire.  

"It" is the teaching of thusness, the dharma of nyoze mentioned in the first line of the song: truth and phenomena and teaching, the perfect harmony of principle and practice. If you want to teach human life you have to teach the perfect harmony of truth and phenomena, theory and practice, equality and distinction. If you teach them separately it won't work; you have to digest through and through theory and practice, equality and distinction. Then you can teach.

The perfect harmony will manifest itself in your personality, and you will become buddha, spreading grace to people in all circumstances.

But this perfect harmony is like a mass of fire: if you touch it you will be burned up and if you ignore it you will be frozen.

If you ignore the phenomenal world and attach to the truth, then you become spaced out.

Floating.

Your life is up in the air and you become crazy. In the good sense you experience ecstasy, religious fascination; but I'm not sure whether that is good for you or not.

Or you don't know what to do about the truth and the phenomenal world, and you become very confused, and your head hurts, and you don't know what to do. So you burn out. You say, "I can't take all this complicated stuff, " and you ignore the truth.

At that time your life doesn't work very well either. Oh, you can have a pretty good career in some specialized field, but I think you life will be very cold; your mind will be very cold, and finally you will be isolated from people and society and you will be very alone.

So turning away and touching are both wrong.

And it is a mass of fire. Your life is just like a fire; not a small fire, an individual fire, but a huge mass of fire: eternal, innumerable, boundless; more than you can measure by any mental process. Living, vivid, energies, constantly coming. Wherever you go, you have to know it, understand what it is. For your life is constantly supported by this mass of fire, this perfect harmony of truth and phenomena, distinction and equality.

Some of you strongly support equality for women. Well, women are women; you should know the distinction between women and men. You cannot combine them, or say that they are exactly the same; equality doesn't mean combination. What you should realize is the perfect harmony with women. You should know who you are, interconnected, interpenetrated, with men and women, trees, birds and the whole human world. And then you can stress equality for women, and it will work pretty well. Because you respect the distinction between men and women you can then respect the equality between men and women.

To take care of your life is to burn your life's energies, wherever you may go. In the realm of science, in the realm of literature, sports, whatever; every moment you have to burn your life's energies. And when you do that you are doing something that is completely beyond our ability to describe in language.

We use the technical term "dharma" to describe this energy, this perfect harmony, but no matter how you explain something technically you will always fail. Because theory is exactly practice. They are not separate. And practice is exactly theory. So if you don't study, your head becomes very soft. And you just do what you like, become like an animal, or a bird. But that practice doesn't last very long for human beings. So practice must be exactly one with theory.

### Part 2

> Just to depict it in literary form  
> Is to relegate it to defilement.  

Let me explain this stanza very simply: If you describe the perfect harmony of theory and practice, distinction and equality, that description will be false. It will miss the bullseye. The bullseye is perfect harmony itself. You can come close in a description, but you will never hit the bullseye.

But literary form cannot be ignored. Even though it doesn't hit the bullseye, you have to understand the word and the explanation of truth in the word.

Which is why Zen has lots of scriptures. And there is a basic Zen philosophy, called the "Five Ranks," which describes five degrees of realization. It is a philosophy of how distinction and equality are harmonized from moment to moment.

The First Rank is "the relative within the absolute." "Relative" can be thought of as practice or distinction, and "absolute" as theory or equality.

Second, "the absolute within the relative."

Third, "the coming within the absolute."

Fourth, "the arrival within the relative."

Fifth, "the attained within integration."

You need to study and understand these, because in the Zen teachings you will often encounter complicated and paradoxical expressions.

For example, if you read the Fukan Zazen-gi, the Universal Recommendation for Zazen by Dogen Zenji, you will come across the following: "Think of nonthinking...This in itself is the essential art of zazen."

You cannot understand this statement intellectually, but our daily life is just like that. That's why Dogen Zenji says: "This in itself is the essential art of zazen."

The essential art of your life. The essential art of the tree's life, or the bird's life, and so on.

"Think of nonthinking" means that "not to have a thought" implies
"to have a thought." So in that sense thinking lies within not thinking.

For example, children imply parents, because there cannot be a child without a set of parents. So, parents lie within children.

Then in Zen we say, "parents are children." It doesn't make sense intellectually, but it is actually the truth.

So think of nonthinking means that the idea of not thinking immediately brings on thinking.

That's why, if you do zazen, I say "Don't think."

If you try not to think, that trying not to think is already giving rise to thought. So finally you say, "How can I stop?"

Just stop.

But you don't understand either thought or non-thought.

When I say "Don't think," then that implies thought, because you are already trying to form an idea of nonthinking.

Which is why I say: "Don't think!" And then immediately you say
"Yes Sir!," and try. As soon as you try not to think, you create thoughts. Always.

That's why, within the framework of thinking, to think of nonthinking means thought and non-thought are the same.

Zen always says I am you, you are I.

Trees are me. Buddha is the oak tree. It doesn't make sense, but it's really true.

If you really think very deeply, what's going on in your life is a perfect harmony of distinction and equality.

You can know this. Even though you don't understand the meaning of thinking or not thinking, you can sit.

Try.

Sit.

Very clearly thoughts appear as they are, and absence of thought appears as clear as possible.

But beyond those you are just there.

Not only in Zen we can say "I think therefore I am," after Descartes. It is really true. You are thinking, that is why you exist.

Who exists?

You try to ignore, or destroy, or neglect your thoughts, and already you are thinking. But there is still something left, completely beyond your ideas of thinking or not thinking.

What is left?

You.

That you is "I think therefore I am."

That is the pure sense of self.

Zazen itself.

I am sitting, that's why I sit.

Why do you want to do zazen? Because zazen is here. I am here, that's why I do zazen. That's all!

It's very simple actually, but we don't understand, and so Zen has to explain through words like these.

For example, in your daily life you use the words "bread and butter." That is two words. But they are not two: if you say bread, bread implies butter. Bread lies within butter. Bread is butter.

But if I say "Bread is butter," you say "What? What did he say?" You don't understand, but it is exactly so.

Why?

You use these terms as single words. "Bread" and "butter." If you say "Bread and butter is Katagiri," it would be wrong grammatically.

That means it doesn't make sense intellectually.

But actually you use bread and butter as one: "Breadandbutter."

So the way you use bread and butter is not according to theory of language, but you use it anyway. As one.

Dogen Zenji goes on to say: "How do you think of nonthinking?"

Not thinking is thinking.

Bread is butter.

What could we possibly mean? How do you think of bread in butter?

You cannot understand it rationally.

It is completely unthinkable. But we must think of "bread is butter" because that is the way we use bread and butter.

It is unthinkable but we use it that way, so we have to think it.

<p align="center"> * * * </p>

Someone says, "Katagiri is a good fellow." Now you don't know Katagiri, so you say, "What do you mean?" If you don't know me, then it's unthinkable.

But Katagiri is a good fellow anyway, so we can just sit here and talk. That is a fact, even though you may not understand it intellectually, even though it is unthinkable. So you have to think the unthinkable.

Therefore the unthinkable is thinkable.

This means that the notion of unthinkable is entirely free from its self-conception. When you say "bread," immediately you attach to the notion of bread. But bread itself is originally free from any notion of "bread." Because bread is butter. Intellectually, it is unthinkable, but in actuality bread is butter. Because you use bread and butter as one.

Non-thought exists, but in order to experience it you have to think it. There is the thinkable.

Technically, this is called "datsuraku," or falling off. Dropping off. Sometimes we say enlightenment, but that has a little different meaning; here we mean just dropping off or falling off.

It is not something you cause to happen. You cannot make bread drop the concept of bread. No. Bread is bread itself. The term "bread" drops off its own self-concept.

Intellectually you don't understand the unthinkable but it is here. Both bread and butter are perfectly unified, working together.

Then what is it that makes them work in perfect harmony, in perfect peace?

That is something thinkable. Even though it seems unthinkable, you have to think about it, because it exists, right here, right in front of you.

For example, peace and war. You cannot always concentrate on peace and ignore war. On the other hand, you cannot always concentrate on war. Right in the middle of war there is peace. It is unthinkable, but right in the middle of war there is somebody, some person who preserves and maintains peace. So, peace is war.

So, you have to think the unthinkable, realize this perfect harmony.

Peace itself is originally free from any self-concept. It is just peace. So if you concentrate on peace alone, no matter for how long, you cannot achieve it.

This is the meaning of the term datsuraku, dropping off.

Bread itself is free from any concept of self. That's why bread becomes butter. Very naturally. Butter itself is free from its concept of self.

That is freedom; essential freedom.

Katagiri is Japanese. But "Japanese" is itself free from self-concept, so Japanese are Americans.

What's the difference?

Katagiri is you. I can shake your hand.

Non-thought is free from any self-concept; thought is free from self-concept. Table, microphone, all of them: all free. So microphone is in the state of dropping off; in other words, freedom.

Katagiri is freedom.

In other words, dropping off means that unthinkable or bread or butter don't hold fast to any concept of themselves.

Bread doesn't hold fast to its belief or its notion of itself. Butter doesn't hold fast to its belief or its notion. So very naturally bread and butter are free, drop off themselves.

Anger has great power to free itself from itself. That's why if you are full of anger, you should please sit down. And then you will say, "I see more strong passion than anger."

This is fairly difficult in everyday life. That is why zazen is good; sit down there and anger drops off. By its own power.

That is what we call freedom.

So then what is anger? What is love?

Is love wonderful?

Well, yes; and then again, no. Because real love is not love opposed to hatred; love itself is complete freedom.

Sometimes love moves to hatred. Then love is hatred. This is very natural, because love is not love by itself; love is hatred. Hatred is love. Sometimes I see couples who are always fighting. That fighting with hatred turns into love. So love and hatred don't hold fast to their own self-concepts.

That is called dropping off.

Freedom. The unthinkable.

It means that the unthinkable has its own motive which lets it move to become thinkable.

So love itself doesn't hold fast to its own self-concept; this means love starts to move to hatred.

Because the microphone is free from it's own self-concept, it moves toward you or me or anybody. It can used by anybody, for anything.

So everything is freedom.

In other words, dropping off.

Hatred, prejudice, pain: all freedom. They have great power to become free from themselves. By their power, which we call [...]

So everything has a certain motive, certain fresh and vivid energies. Hatred has fresh and vivid energy to be free from itself. If you don't fight with it, then it becomes calm very naturally. But if you fight it, it becomes bigger, because it depends on you to make it big or make it small, or make it become still. If you let it become quiet or still, it will become quiet. So very naturally hatred itself drops off by its own power.

This is zazen. And it is pretty good for us.

Then the practical question is, how do we come to understand the fresh and living energy which is present in everything?

By the practice of no arrogance.

Selflessness.

Egolessness.

Through the practice of egolessness you can realize how everything has its own fresh and vivid energy. If you become selfless, you can get that energy. As soon as you sit down in zazen, you have begun the practice of egolessness.

Sometime, when you are sitting, you will receive this big energy.
Because if you become egoless, very naturally this fresh and vivid energy will come up. Just like the water from a spring.

That is a pretty good realization.

Then people become surprised and confused, and don't know what to do. But it is not necessary to be concerned about it. It is a very natural situation. As Dogen Zenji says, forget the self. Or as this sutra ends: "As though a fool, like an idiot." The words are different, but the meaning is the same. So remember that everything has these fresh and vivid energies.

How do we learn this?

Through the practice of no arrogance; egolessness; forgetting the self. At that time everything will come up to you.

In other words you should deal with you rpen, and water, and vegetable with wholeheartedness.

And then vegetable will come to you. But you cannot make it happen. Vegetable has its own fresh and vivid energies. So it can help your life. And the arrival within the relative means you can move toward the vegetable; and then the vegetable will come to you.

That is the interacting communion between you and the vegetable; between all things.

<p align="center"> * * * </p>

The first rank is the relative within the absolute. Everthing you see is not merely relative; it is something more. It has a very deep meaning. Even something as insignificant as toilet paper has a life full of deep meaning. So you should not use it carelessly. Because of the relative within the absolute; the toilet paper comes from somthing else. Your intellectual sense won't let you think of it in that way, but that is the way it really is.

There actually is a perfect harmony between your life and the life of the toilet paper; its life can help your life. So there is something thinkable there; and you should think it. That toilet paper comes from the effort of myriad people. It is a very small thing, but it is deeply interconnected with the lives of all sentient beings.

And you can practice egolessness, even in the use of this little piece of toilet paper. In the Zen monastery we gassho, see the toilet paper, and take just one or two pieces. Not three or four, recklessly.

This is egolessness.

Egolessness does not mean to reduce your individuality. If I said that you wouldn't believe me, because you always want to express your identity and exercise your power.

Show how wonderful you are.

So always you come first.

But I say, forget yourself; put yourself in the place of the toilet paper. You may think that this means to reduce your individuality, but that is not so. It's really the practice of egolessness.

And if you practice egolessness then very naturally the toilet paper moves toward you and helps your life. You move toward that deep life of the toilet paper and the toilet paper comes up to you and helps. That is the relative within the absolute.

<p align="center"> * * * </p>

The second rank is the absolute within the relative. This means that you cannot deal with the absolute alone, separate from the relative. If you want to explain the absolute you must do so in terms of the relative, in terms of the human world.

Now each thing in the relative has its own freedom. It can drop off its self-concept by itself. It can show very deep meaning.

<p align="center"> * * * </p>

Then there is the third rank, the coming from within the absolute. Everything comes from the absolute. It is a huge world, one you cannot measure by any mental process. But you can experience it. Just move toward vegetable, or toilet paper with wholeheartedness. Wholeheartedness means to manifest your own fresh and vivid energies, which makes your life move toward your object in the pure sense.

So the first step is to jump into it, with true heart and sincerity. And then, in the process of jumping in with true heart you can learn what it is.

Love, hatred, whatever.

You have to learn about the real world. As a practical matter you must move toward the third rank. Because you have understood the first and the second, and you know how deep, how profound everything is. Then as a practical matter you should face everything with attentiveness, kindness, and compassion. That is the coming from within the absolute.

<p align="center"> * * * </p>

And then there occurs the arrival within the relative. The toilet paper comes up to you and helps. So nothing is wasted. Even hatred and pain disappear and we learn the depth of human life. That is our arrival.

So then you truly know how to take care of pen, and water, vegetable and toilet paper. You know how to take care of your life. That is the arrival within the relative.

<p align="center"> * * * </p>

Finally, there is the fifth rank: the attained within the integration.

This is called oneness.

It is a kind of identity action. You and I work together completely, absolutely. Perfect harmony exists.

Regardless of whether we understand or not, perfect harmony will constantly exist.

In you, in me, in the relationship between you and me. Wherever we may go.

If your practice proceeds through the first four ranks, then very naturally you will learn the true meaning of things like love and hatred.

In the process of sharing your life with other people you will touch the core of love, touch what love really is.

At that time you can be exactly one with the other person. That is identity action.

If you share your life with someone, then in that process you will discover the real meaning of love and hatred, pleasure and pain; the real meaning of life. Otherwise all you understand is the notion, or the concept of love. The notion of hatred. The notion of pain.

Most people are carried away by these notions. If you sit down in zazen and your legs hurt, then you experience pain. And you say that it's real.

But I don't think so.

If you believe it's real then you fight it. And it gets worse.

That sensation that you feel is not the real pain. The real pain is something that you should just let be. And very naturally, sooner or later, it drops off by itself.

I don't mean you should injure yourself, or commit suicide. Sometimes you have to take care of the pain. But this does not mean you have to create a hatred, or passion toward pain. Just take care of it.

That is called identity action.

For example, you are an adult and you want to play with a child.
To play with a child you must practice egolessness. Forget who you are. Jump into the child's world.

Then you can play.

It is just like a mother, making funny faces and talking to her baby. On the street, or in a car. Her baby doesn't understand, but it talks back. That indicates that the mother is practicing no arrogance. Forgetting herself, jumping completely into baby's world, no matter where she may be.

But if you create a gap you cannot play with a baby in this way.
You cannot talk or make funny faces because you are paying attention to the people around you, and worrying about what they think. But a mother can completely forget herself, and jump in. That's why she can play so well with her baby.

That is the first point about identity action. The second point is that you cannot forget your position. A mother forgets herself, but she doesn't forget her role as a mother. So if the baby wets itself or soils somebody else's dress then she has to say she is sorry and take care of it. Because she is the mother, not the baby.

You have to practice no arrogance and jump into baby's life but still you are you. You should maintain your role; when you have to attend to your duty you have to attend to your duty. You cannot confuse yourself with the baby.

For example, you can say equally: "Katagiri is teacher" and "Katagiri is good friend." The Buddha said this many times: "Teacher is good friend." But you should not think that this means that the Buddha is just a good buddy, with no particular role or position. If you say to your teacher, "Oh, you good buddy," then you are completely confused.

Because teacher is teacher.

Buddha is Buddha.

You are you.

You cannot mix them up. First you have to communicate with the Buddha as a friend; then you can really play with the Buddha. So when you have to bow, you should bow.

But Buddha is Buddha, and you are you.

On the one hand you have to completly forget yourself and jump into Buddha's world. Then you will experience that world. On the other hand so you should keep your position, you should maintain your identity.

So the first point is that you have to go completely beyond the distinction between mother and child. And from the second point you have to go beyond the equality.

And then there is a third point.

Sometimes, when no one is watching, the baby may crawl off to a dangerous place. Or snatch things, like somebody's hat in a crowd. At that time the mother has to say, "No, don't do that."

So first you have to go beyond distinction, second you have to go beyond equality, and third you have to guide.

With compassion, constantly with compassion. To guide means that the baby goes one way and you say, "Don't, don't go that way; please go this way." That's all.

And then, fourth, you can have warm human communion, human communication, as between baby and mother. Wherever the mother may be, she has the baby constantly in her mind. It becomes very difficult to separate herself from the baby.

The more you practice like this the more difficult it becomes to separate yourself from other people. Even though you may be physically separated, actually you are not separate; you feel always the presence of the baby, or some other person. That is called interacting communion of appeal and response.

There is a huge interacting communion there, beyond specific babies or specific mothers. For it is really possible to take care of a baby as a wonderful buddha. That is the identity action, the fifth rank: the attained with integration.

<p align="center"> * * * </p>

Intellectually we have to understand these Five Ranks, or five degrees of realization. But our practice is just sitting.

Except just sitting is not just sitting. Because if you emphasize just sitting, then you attach to equality. You must make every effort to sit with straight body, and proper posture: this is distinction.

You cannot ignore distinction. But you cannot become obsessed with the right posture, for then you will work so hard you will exhaust yourself.

I don't know how well you can adjust to it, but you should learn through actual practice. You cannot ignore the distinction between you and zazen. So you should work hard.

And then you can go beyond distinctions like working hard or working easy. At that time you can just sit.

This is equality.

Very naturally you will suffer from difficulties in following your breath. No one really understands breathing in zazen. Many people ask me how they can take care of their breathing in zazen.

Well, I don't know either. I am still working on it.

So you have to work hard. There is nothing wrong with that. And then at some time equality will manifest itself. It's pretty nice, just sitting there and following your breath.

That is called shikan. And then you will experience interacting communion between yourself and zazen. You guide zazen, and zazen guides you.

So very naturally there is a wonderful communication.

Finally you cannot escape zazen; you really enjoy it, even though you feel pain. The more you do zazen the more you realize that zazen and the more deeply it penetrates your life. It is just like chewing brown rice. When you see brown rice it looks ugly and distasteful, but if you chew it for a long time a wonderful flavor comes up. Zazen is just like that.

> It is bright just at midnight;  
> It doesn't appear at dawn.  

"Bright" in this case is a metaphor for the phenomenal world; when it is bright you can see everything clearly: book, table, and so forth. A world of distinction. And "at midnight" means darkness; but in Zen Buddhism darkness doesn't mean dark. It means the truth, or ultimate principle. Because in darkness everything becomes equal. So midnight stands for utimate truth, ultimate nature, or theory.

So it is bright just at midnight.

Intellectually it doesn't make sense, but it is really true, for distinction and equality work together. In peace and harmony.

Then what is distinction?

It is distinction in equality. Working together. Bright just at midnight.

In the The Merging of Difference and Unity, it says: "The spiritual source shines clearly in the light." "Spiritual source" means the truth. When it is at work in everything then the world becomes bright.

Distinction arises, and you can see table, and people, and microphone. But table, and people, and microphone are in the spiritual source. So there is nothing but the spiritual source. Working together.

On the other hand, it doesn't appear at dawn. The truth does not appear in front of you, visible to your naked eye. But it's there.

Equality can be seen in distinction; distinction flows into equality, into the source. In the Merging of Difference and Unity, it says: "The branching streams flow in the darkness."

All distinctions, all phenomena, flow into the darkness of truth and equality. And equality flows into the world of distinction and phenomena. So phenomena are phenomena, but they are something more.

The mountain you can see is a mountain, but it is something more than the mountain you see. That's why it is wonderful, and it attracts you. But sometimes it repels you, because it seems too dangerous for you.

So finally you have to go beyond distinction and beyond equality.
Then you can guide. Then you can educate. Then you can take care.

### Part 3

> It acts as a guide for all beings --  
> Its use removes all pains.

According to the philosophical background of the Soto Zen tradition, truth does not exist by itself, separate from phenomena. And phenomena do not exist separate from the truth.

The same can be said of theory and practice. If you wish to explain theory, that theory must be exactly one with practice. If you practice, your practice must be exactly one with theory. If it is not, it will not last very long.

So theory and practice go together. As one; not as two things in accord. If you say that practice must be in accord with theory, then you are falling into the trap of dualistic thinking. So when you say "theory," right then there must be practice.

That means that theory must penetrate people's hearts. At that time theory will become rooted very deeply in the ground of everyday human life. Then when you explain theory it will really help people.

But if you explain theory separate from human life, that theory will just be theory.

Like a dead tree.

Your life will become just that: theoretical. So your theory is not part of your life, and even though you can explain some aspect of this theory, it will just be like a dead tree. Because it won't connect with your life. And so no matter how much you explain it will fail to help people.

When you explain some aspect of theory, you must devote yourself wholeheartedly to just the explanation. That's enough. It's not necessary to think about practice. Because the practice will be there.

So through explanation you can both give the theory and show an example of practice. If you treat them separately you cannot do both simultaneously. But it will be enough if you just present the theory with all your heart.

Because then the two become one. And you will have given both, simultaneously. With no distinction between theory and practice.

Dogen Zenji said: "When one side appears, the other is in darkness." That means that although the other side doesn't appear, it is there. Like a sheet of paper. If you use one side, you just have to use that side; the other side is simultaneously there. It is not necessary to point out the other side, for it is one with this side. As a practical matter, all you have, to do is use this side. And the other is already with you.

That is oneness.

That is what Dogen Zenji was referring to.

That is a very important lesson, particularly in Zen Buddhism. It is quite different from the Western teaching of dialectic. Some scholars have written that this teaching is the same as dialectic, but actually it's quite different.

According to the dialectic you have to recognize opposition and conflict with it. So you practice in the realm of dualism. And you try to destroy the old things and get the new; the new always supplants the old. That is why you cannot stop the constant conflict, why there is no peace.

According to Zen Buddhist teaching, you should completely devote yourself to accepting and using the new. That's enough. And the old will always be there. So when you practice this way it is not necessary to destroy the old in order to get the new. The old is always with all new things. All you have to do is accept the new and deal with the new with true heart. And the old will be there.

The same applies to theory and practice, good and bad, right and wrong, truth and phenomena. Absolute and relative are one. You cannot separate them at all. You cannot deal with them in a dualistic way, because in practice you cannot do two things at once.

So all you have to do is deal with the relative. At that moment the absolute will be with you.

This teaching fits every aspect of human life: professional life, everyday life, whatever. It fits any situation, and lets you create a peaceful, harmonious world. That is why it acts as a guide for beings. If you understand the teaching and use it you can really remove human pain and suffering.

---

> Although it is not fabricated,  
> It is not without speech.  

"Although it is not fabricated" is a reference to the unconditioned world, the absolute. "It is not without speech" means the phenomenal world.

You can explain or manifest yourself, but your life can never be manifested exactly. Because your life is very deep. So you have to understand both the life which you can manifest, and the life which cannot be manifested.

That life is very deep.

Very hard.

Very complicated.

So you cannot manifest or expound it. We call it
"Buddha-nature," "Supreme Perfection," "Supreme Bodhi." Those are just technical terms; the meaning is that your life is very deep. Coming from the beginning of the past, going to the future; endlessly.

That is your life.

And not only human life: trees, birds, everything is like this.

If you look at your life from this point of view, you are nothing but this ordinary being, which happens to have a human body and a human mind through whose six senses you can see and hear and think.

But you cannot grasp the absolute with these senses.

Which is why this sutra begins, "The teaching of thusness has been intimately conveyed by buddhas and patriarchs."

"The teaching of thusness," the dharma of nyoze, the relative and absolute working in perfect harmony: this is not something you can grasp directly by your six senses.

But it can be transmitted from patriarch to patriarch; from person to person.

So the dharma is mysterious, because it cannot be grasped by the six senses; but it is not mysterious, because it can be transmitted to the next generation.

Very practically, very clearly.

Now this verse says, "...it is not fabricated." That is a reference to the unconditioned world. But on the other hand, "...it is not without speech." So you can transmit it.

Now this is very important, for it means that the human form is not bound and constrained. It is, in fact, liberated; emancipated.

Free.

I can think that the human form is bound and constrained, that Katagiri here is the result of his family and other things. Using ideas like these I can fabricate a kind of conditioned world.

But on the other hand this human form and any ideas I fabricate are characterized by the inherent ability to be free from any such ideas.

Because the phenomenal world is simultaneously interconnected and interpenetrated by the absolute. It is going there, constantly. Human form also. So very naturally I cannot hold on to this form. This is what we call emptiness. Katagiri's form, all form is emptiness.

When I realize this I see something that I have never seen before. My goodness! This is my life?! How wonderful I am! I see the huge world that we call the absolute.

So this form has great powers to see that this form is not merely this form. That it is something else, because it is connected with the absolute.

So body, mind, ideas are always characterized by their own power to move towards the absolute, to be liberated. And then we can see the wonderful world that we call the absolute. And we try to attach to the absolute but the absolute itself is also emptiness.

So very naturally you cannot hold onto the absolute. But the absolute is always coming into the human form, always interconnected with it. Just like two feet, walking as one.

<p align="center"> * * * </p>

In the Bendowa Dogen Zenji wrote: "The practice of the way makes myriad dharmas exist in realization." In the huge world, Buddhist world, the practice of the way makes myriad forms exist: tables, our bodies, everything.

Exist where?

Not in the small world where arguments happen, but in realization. In the largest, broadest perspective. A huge world, connected with past, present, and future.

This is called Mu, the unconditioned world. In Zen we say "Your face before your parents' birth."

And then Dogen Zenji says: "And practice a total reality by transcending realization." You cannot always stay with that realization, that so-called absolute or buddha-nature. In order understand the unconditioned world you have to practice.

For instance, if you have some hope, some goal for the future, you must practice that hope every day. That is good practice for us, to take a hope and think carefully and find out a way to realize it. The hope itself is part of the unconditioned world, because you haven't reached it yet.

But it is alive in your life.

That is what it means to transcend realization. You transcend the hope by practicing here and now. That is what Dogen Zenji meant by practicing the total reality.

At that time you can go over the barrier of the absolute, the barrier of the phenomenal, the barrier of what you think of as "my body." Then all your bonds drop away, and you are not affected by categories and distinctions, such as the thought of "my body."

This does not mean you attach to the absolute, the buddha body. The buddha body is there, but you cannot attach to it. You have to transcend it.

How can you manifest the buddha body with your body, in our world?

Practice.

For instance, there are many kinds of gassho. When I teach you a certain gassho, you should listen to it, and accept it, and do gassho in that way. The gassho is done with your human body. It is not the actual buddha body. But with your human body you can manifest the buddha body.

How?

Just accept the instruction of how to gassho, and then do the gassho carefully, wholeheartedly; with true heart.

At that time, the buddha body blooms. The next moment, a thought arises, and you are back in the human body. The moment after that, you keep quiet and then the buddha body arises.

<p align="center"> * * * </p>

Usually we are chasing after our thoughts, and so we just see the human body do gassho. And we think about gassho. We read a book of Mudras and find many kinds of gassho. So we complain to our teacher and refuse to accept the one we have been taught. Or we ask, "What is the meaning of gassho?"

As a result we become completely involved in a world fabricated by human thought.

That's all right, because you already live in the world fabricated by your thoughts.

But you cannot always play in that world, or you will be completely carried away. And you will not understand the significance of human life. And you will become confused. You may be very practical, but you will be very shallow.

So the important point is that we must do something with this body that is more than just this body. That is the point, always.

For instance, say you are an artist and you wish to carve a statue of the Buddha. You have to use wood, and chisels, and your body. But you also have to use your human body to be something more than human body; to be Buddha body. You must become Buddha before you can really make a Buddha. If you work the wood with nothing but your human body, then the statue will never really be a statue of Buddha. Buddha must become one with you. Then you carve the Buddha, but it is more than just you that is doing the carving.

That is our everyday practice.

So the sutra says "Although it is not fabricated, it is not without speech."

This is what we call liberation, or emancipation. Everything is liberated. This table before me is liberated. It is not just the table you hold in your thoughts. It is free, emancipated from the limits of your thoughts. The technical term is "Samboghakaya Buddha." Something between Dharmakaya Buddha, the truth or absolute, and Nirmanakaya Buddha, the world of our perceptions and concepts. Something more than the limited world of our concepts, something emancipated from it.

That freedom really teaches people. If you are not emancipated, liberated in your actions and your practice, it is very difficult to teach or to help people. We must keep that in mind always in our practice.

<p align="center"> * * * </p>

There was a very famous Zen teacher, Ishtano Zenji [?], who was Abbot of the Eihei-ji monastery in Japan. He had a very wonderful practice, always manifesting that liberated human mind and human body, wherever he may have been.

One day, he had to perform a Buddhist service for a particular family. This particular service involved chanting the family's name before the service. Ishtano [?] chanted, but he chanted the wrong name. The Jisha heard this, went up to the Zenji and murmured in his ear that he had made a mistake and had to chant the name of the right family.

Immediately, the Zenji said: "Shut up! I did it right!" 

And everybody there, monks, priests, and visitors, all of them laughed. Now if I did something like that, everyone would be mad at me. But that Zenji instead created a wonderful moment. No one was mad at him. He made a mistake, but that family appreciated him very much anyway.

Because he always practiced with full concentration on his practice. With a true heart. So that practice built up in his life, in his body, each time he acted in that way. That's why when the Jisha came and poked his head in this very nice Buddhist practice, the Zenji said, "Shut up!"

That's really a very interesting example. It shows the Zenji teaching the people about liberation, freedom and Nirvana. Through a living being.

Maybe you have experienced something like this in your daily life. Sometimes you see a truly beautiful person. And then you feel something very wonderful, even if you don't talk to them.

Have you ever experienced that?

Well, maybe sometime in the future you will. Maybe you will encounter someone like that Zenji; even though you don't talk to them, no matter what they do, you feel good.

I lived at Eihei-ji Monastery for four years with a hundred and twenty monks. Each one different. A certain monk was not very smart, but when I was with him I felt comfortable. Another monk was very smart, and a very nice man, but when I was with him I didn't have the same peaceful and comfortable feeling.

So there is something there. A difference you can detect, even without the use of language. Even among people as similar as priests and monks there is a difference.

If you practice every day, continually and inconspicuously, just like a child walking, then you will experience these wonderful things. It is what I mean when I tell you to make the roots of your life strong.

That practice is not a showy practice.

It is a very calm practice.

When you do gassho, just do gassho. When the teacher says, "Just do gassho with wholeheartedness," you say "Yes, Sir!" and just do it. Not showy; not one kind of fancy gesture or another.

When you smile with joy, the whole world becomes joyful. You cannot be mad at anybody. This is the very quiet practice; just do gassho.

And if you continue this practice you can make the root of your life strong, and in everyday life that practice will arise and brighten your life. Which is why this sutra ends with "Practice secretly, working within, as though a fool, like an idiot -- if you can achieve continuity this is called the host within the host. "

This is the main point. This is the Buddhist practice. Buddhist practice is very calm, stable, and not showy. It is to make the root of your life strong.

So that is emanicipation. The manifestation of the unconditioned world in our daily life. In this world, the phenomenal world. Right here.

How?

You cannot escape having been born. And right in the middle of having been born you have to manifest the unconditioned world. This means your are right in the middle of life but you are not panicked. You are in the middle of panic but you are not panicked. That is what we call the practice of emancipation.

<p align="center"> * * * </p>

Early in his life as a monk, Dogen Zenji asked the question: If everything is buddha nature, why is it that we have to practice?

Everything is buddha. Gold, trees, even the smallest piece of wood is important because it is buddha. You can keep a piece of wood and know that it is buddha. But if you don't carve it into the form of Buddha, then Buddha doesn't appear. You have to carve it.

So there is the unconditioned world, or the absolute, which has a very deep life. You can keep it and respect it and know that it is the absolute. But if you want to make a Buddha, you have to carve. You have to manifest the buddha in the phenomenal world.

It is like a radish. You can eat a radish plain, and know that the radish is buddha. But it is much nicer if you use a little soy sauce, and some ginger, and other spices to add to the flavor. So that is the relation between buddha and phenomena.

They are interconnected.

Human body and the entire world of the absolute are interconnected.

You do not understand the entire world of the absolute. You don't know how your body enters this world. I don't know either. But you can manifest the absolute.

When you do gassho, just gassho. Make that gassho the entire world. Don't poke your head into it. If you poke your head into it, then the gassho slips away from the Buddha world. It becomes very shaky and unstable. You miss the chance to make the root of your life strong. But in the gassho there is a practice to make the root of your life strong. Just do the gassho. Then with your body you have manifested the Buddha body.

### Part 4

Text:

> It is like facing a jewel mirror;  
> Form and image behold each other --  
> You are not it  
> It actually is you.  

Commentary:

The jewel mirror means to be free from the stage of the absolute and free from the stage of phenomena. Phenomena does not hold to a fixed position.

It has the power to move to move to the absolute.

So the absolute and the relative are both characterized by being liberated. That is called the jewel mirror.

If you stand up in front of this particular jewel mirror, form and image will behold each other. At this time you can see yourself and you can see your image. Image here means the absolute; you as form are the phenomenal world.

Human world. Human body.

But simultaneously human body shows its own shadow. The absolute. A deep, big world that you know nothing about.

So form and image are always interconnected, right in front of the jewel mirror. The jewel mirror is Buddha's world: always there.

So you are not it; it actually is you. The absolute actually is you. You are not buddha nature; if you think so, you cannot ever be a buddha. You are a human being. But buddha nature is at every moment you.

Even though you cannot accept this intellectually, it is so.

Because you live facing the jewel mirror, Buddha's world. You may not want to, but you are living like this, with form and image always interconnected.

The Zen Master (Tozan) composed a poem that said:

> Blue mountain is the father of the white cloud  
> White cloud is the son of the blue mountain  
> All day the white cloud depends on the blue mountain  
> But the blue mountain does not know that at all.

Blue mountain is father of the white cloud is a metaphor for form is emptiness. The phenomenal is the absolute. The human body is the entire whole world. The human body is Buddha.

White cloud is the son of the blue mountain means that emptiness is form; the absolute is the phenomenal. Buddha nature is Katagiri's human body. At every moment.

And then the white cloud depends on the blue mountain. I, Katagiri, as a form, depend constantly on the absolute.

But the blue mountain does not know that at all.

We don't know.

I don't know how I as a form depend on the absolute.

I don't know means I really don't know.

I just accept myself as a form living right in the middle of that interconnection, interpenetration between Buddha's world and myself. So when I do gassho, Katagiri just stands up here and does gassho. That's enough. And then the Buddha is exactly there.

So from one point of view I am not the absolute when I practice gassho with my body. But on the other hand, "the absolute is exactly you" means that buddha nature is exactly Katagiri; so the entire world is exactly Katagiri's human body. That is what is meant by interconnection and interpenetration. Always I depend on the absolute; but I cannot perceive how, because it is always exactly me.

Text:

> It is like a babe in the world, 
> In five aspects complete;  
> It does not go nor come,  
> Nor rise nor stand.  
> "Baba Wawa" --  
> Is there anything said or not?  
> Ultimately it does not apprehend anything  
> Because its speech is not yet correct.

Commentary:

This metaphor is drawn from the Nirvana Sutra. There the Tathagata is likened to a baby in that he does not rise, stand, come, go, or speak.

The first, he does not rise, means the Tathagata does not give rise to forms of the myriad dharmas. Tathagata does not see this microphone, or tape recorder, or table as forms. Humans see them as forms, and automatically we attach to what we see, even if only intellectually. But the Tathagata does not see the tape recorder as a form. He sees it as Buddha.

Which it is.

And you can see it that way.

Even in small things, you can be liberated from form in your everyday life.

Right in the middle of one part of your practice, for instance a gassho, you have to be liberated from the form of the gassho. If you attach to the form you start to poke your head into the gassho. And then you become more and more attached to that form.

But a buddha doesn't see the form. This means, if you do gassho, just do gassho. Gassho is Buddha. So a buddha sees gashho as Buddha; gassho is the blooming of the Buddha.

That means simply to accept things.

For instance, you see a handsome man or a beautiful woman. If you are not interested in that person as a form, you can just pass by them; you don't see them as an object of opposite sex. Without leaving any trace you can just talk to them and then leave.

So you can see an attractive person as a form, but you should really see them as a Buddha. That means you deal with them in the best and simplest way. That is a pretty good practice for us. Just say what you have to say and leave.

That's why we say in Zen terms, just drink a cup of tea and leave.

But of course we don't do that. We drink a cup of tea and stay there. Chat. Finally we fight.

That's very common. My teacher constantly told me that when I finished something I should leave as soon as possible.

But of course I didn't, because I felt constantly lonely. So I would go back, down to the village, perform a service for a family and then talk with the people. And stay there. My teacher would always say, no way, come back soon.

So that is not to rise: not to see the form of attractive people or your friends, but always to see the Buddha. It is a difficult practice, but we can do it, every day. It is very calm, quiet, strong, stable practice. You must try to do it.

The second aspect, not to stand, means that the Tathagata does not attach to the forms of myriad dharmas. If you see everything as Buddha very naturally you do not attach to the form. That doesn't mean you ignore the form; you can deal with it very effectively. You can deal with the vegetable not as vegetable, but as Buddha. You can deal with water not as the form of water but as the Buddha. So very naturally you do not attach to the form of the water. And you can deal with the water as best and simply as you can and just wash your face.

The third aspect is not to come. This means that his actions are agitated, but are imperturbable as Mount Sumeru. However people criticize him he is acting with imperturbabilty. His mind, his body, his life is never agitated by failure, or benefit, or criticism.

Zen Master Ichizaki [?] Roshi taught us that the priest's life is supported by other people. According to his way he would. never ask people for money or food or anything. Never. Even though he was very poor, he would never ask anyone. He just lived. And he told us very often that the priestly life is just like that. "According to my way," he would say, "I do not ask anything of anybody. Because my life is supported by all sentient beings." And then finally he would say, "If no one gives me food or anything, all I have to do is just be starved to death. This is my priestly life."

I was very impressed.

For if one doesn't ask, If one's life is supported by other people, then there is no guarantee that anyone will give money, or that they will give enough. So he said, if no one gives any money or food, all I have to do is just be starved to death. That is the priest's life, he said often, and told us we should remember it. And it is true.

So a Buddha has no agitation or hesitation, even if there is no food or no money.

When I was in college I had very little money. I was not agitated very much, but it was very inconvenient. Very inconvenient. So I thought I should have money, because when I wanted to go someplace to listen to a lecture, I would have to walk. And it would take a long time. And so I felt that it was very inconvenient not to have any money. But a Buddha, a Tathagata would never feel that way.

The fourth aspect, not to go, means that the Tathagata has already attained the great Nirvana. He sees this microphone not as a form, but as Buddha; he does not attach to the microphone, or people, or any form. He just lets them go by, constantly pass by. And he deals with all of them wholeheartedly. So very naturally there is no agitation. Very naturally his life is just going -- as a Buddha. Whatever he does. When he does gassho, Buddha does gassho. When he sleeps, Buddha sleeps. When he walks, Buddha walks. So people are very naturally respectful. That is what is meant by the Tathagata has already attained to the great Nirvana. Nirvana means Buddha. Buddha was born, Buddha is living, Buddha dies. Not just a human body dies.

The fifth aspect, not to speak, is explained this way: the Tathagata speaks of myriad dharmas for all sentient beings but indeed he has nothing to be spoken.

"Nothing to be spoken" means that the Tathagata does not have a specific lesson that he teaches, so-called Buddha's teaching.
No, he doesn't. He always gives the teaching according to circumstances, and the characteristics and personalities of the people he is teaching.

For example, if he sees a stingy person he may ask him what is the purpose of keeping all that money. Maybe he will give a sermon which will persuade that stingy person to use his money for someone, or some purpose. On the other hand, if he sees a profligate, he may convince him to save his money. So he does not have a fixed lesson about money. He does not teach that money is good or money is bad. That is what it means for the Tathagata not to speak.

So here "Baba Wawa" means words, lots of words. Whether you use words or do not use words, real reality is beyond explanation or no explanation.

Commentary:
The "double split hexagram" is a diagram from the I Ching, which Tozan used to illustrate the Five Ranks. This diagram was used to illustrate that one entity, so-called table, does not exist alone but is interconnected with all sentient beings.

And not just the table.

People, microphone, this table exists interconnected, interpenetrated with table, people, floor, winter, all sentient beings. This is what it means to be like the six lines of the double split hexagram.

The relative and absolute integrate, piled up they make three, the complete transformation makes five. This can be understood if you consider the following diagram:
	
                     |– relative within the absolute
                     |
                     |– absolute within the relative
    piled up, they   |
    make three       |             |– coming within the absolute
                     |             |
                     |– integrate –|– arrival within the relative
                                   |
    the complete                   |– attained within integration
    transformation
    makes five
	
	
The relative and absolute integrate. The relative means the relative within the absolute. The absolute means the absolute within the relative. Then integrate, which refers to the coming within the absolute, the arrival within the relative, and the attained within integration.

If you pile them up they make three: the three are the relative, the absolute, and integrate. The complete transformation makes five refers to all five of the Five Ranks, the philosophical basis for Soto Zen teaching.

In Japanese the relative is called "hen." The absolute is called
"sho."

And we say "sho hen ego."

"Ego" means that a number of things more than two interpenetrate without losing the significance of their own peculiarity. This translation uses "integrate;" that may be close, but not exactly
