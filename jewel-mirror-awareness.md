## Teisho by Danin Katagiri Roshi 

This document is drawn from a series of nine talks given by Dainin Katagiri Roshi on the *Song of the Jewel Mirror Awareness*, from November 7, 1983 to January 1, 1984. Transcription of both series was made by Earl Broadbent. Jeff Broadbent edited that into two versions: one long, one abridged. (It’s not clear which version this is.)

### Introduction

This is a song.

In Japanese we call it Hôkyozammal, "Jewel Mirror Awareness," omitting the word "Song." But Manzan, a famous Japanese Zen master, stressed that the title should include the word "Song." For this is not only a very important sutra: it is a song, one which is chanted every day in Soto Zen monasteries.

A song appeals very deeply to your heart, and impresses you very much. Even if you don't understand it. We learn songs as children, often singing them before we understand what the words mean, and as adults we stils remember them.

This is why it is called the "Song of Jewel Mirror Awareness." "Awareness" of course means "samadhi." The Song of Jewel Mirror Samadhi.


So here we have a song which is also a very important sutra. You should recite it as well as study it, so that it becomes as much of you as a song of your childhood.

The Song of Jewel Mirror Awareness is a very simple sutra, consisting of 376 Chinese characters arranged into 94 phrases. It was written by the Zen master Tozan, who lived from 807 to 865, and who is greatly respected as the founder of the sotö tradition of Zen Buddhism. He also systematized the philosophical background of Soto Zen teaching into the so-called "Five Ranks."

***

Tozan practiced under the guidance of Ungan. One day he was to leave his teacher and set out on a pilgrimage to other Zen temples. Before he left, Tozan asked Ungan:

"After you have passed away, how can I answer someone who asks me what you were like?"

Ungan replied, "Say to him, just this is." Ungan then went on to say, "You must now be very careful, as you are carrying this great thing. Consider it again and again."

Do you see what Ungan meant by "Just this is?"

Tozan went on his travels, always pondering this statement "Just this is." Then one day he was crossing a body of water and saw his image reflected there. Immediately he understood the teaching of Ungan, and composed the following gatha:

> You shouldn't search it outwardly  
> If you do, the truth will become more remote from you.  
> But when alone I proceed through myself,  
> Wherever I go I meet him.  
> Now he is not other than myself, yet I am not he.  
> Only if you understand this will you unite with the Tathägata.  

If you want to seek the truth you cannot search for it outwardly. If you do, the truth will become more and more remote from you. The more you conceptualize, the more you try to achieve objective and rational understanding, the more complex and distant the truth will become. But in fact the truth is really very simple.

Tozan realized this and understood Ungan's teaching when he saw his image in the water. A reflection. So he very naturally saw that the reflection was not himself, that there was something, Big Self, True Self, beyond the reflection in the water.

Who could this be?

"When alone I proceed through myself." When you walk alone, when there is really the truth, Big Self.

"Wherever I go, I meet him." So True Self meets that reflection wherever it goes. And, "He is not other than myself." So True Self and reflection cannot be separated. True Self does not float around like some kind of spirit or ghost. But, "I am not he." So there is more to us than the reflection that our senses perceive. But on the other hand, reflection must be there, or there is nothing for us to see.

So, wherever we may go, we see the reflection. And this leads people to believe that the reflection is their true selves.

That is a completely perverted view.

But that does not mean we can ignore that reflection. Reflection is not the truth, yet without the refection we cannot see the truth.

So where is real truth, True Self?

Outside, or inside of you?

Exactly neither.

Because if you say outside, then you are just seeking the truth outside of yourself, and it will get farther and farther away from you, become more and mure conceptualized and artificial. If you say inside, you are still seeking the truth through your ordinary consciousness, objectively. What inside part of you is it?

Not "inside," not "outside." True Self is completely beyond our ability to discuss in words.

We can use language to create concepts and words, to see things objectively. When we think this way, we say that we understand, or that we know or don't know about something. But True Self exists completely outside any system of concepts. It is not something that we can capture in words and symbols.

It is something alive.

It is life itself, real life.

***

You don't think consciously about your breath or the beating of our heart when you go to sleep. If you did, you would become very nervous; maybe even schizophrenic. Even though you sleep, your heart keeps on beating. But there is no guarantee that your heart will keep on beating. Because a beating heart is something that belongs to this limited world. There is uncertainty with each heartbeat, a kind of crisis. Because you don't know whether or not your heart is going to stop. So your heart exists within the limits of its own life, and also in a state of crisis.

What, then, is a beating heart?

Is it some kind of object that you can grasp? There is some kind of object there, but it is not a beating heart. If it were, then when your heart stopped you could pour heartbeats into it, like gasoline into a car. But you can't. So should we worry about each heartbeat when we go to bed? No, because we would go crazy.

What, then, is it?

It is the real truth, beyond your ability to put into words or concepts. Before a conscious thought arises or does not arise, your heart beats. From moment to moment your heart is alive. And something which is alive is something which is interconnected, interpenetrated with all sentient beings. "All sentient beings" means more beings, visible and invisible, than you can see with your eyes, smell with your nose, or grasp with your mind.

This is the real life of a beating heart.

The aliveness of life. Always interconnected, interpenetrated with all beings. This is completely beyond your thinking. Before you think or don't think, there is real life.

So then where is Big Self, True Self?

Inside or outside? No way.

If you say inside or outside you have used a word to represent an object separate from you. But before even the thought of that word there was something alive, a kind of impulse. After that impulse comes your thoughts and concepts and all the other objects you create in your life.

So there is something before thought.

Without that something, nothing can be created. We call it real life, Big Self, True Self. Only the True Self goes alone. That's why Tozan says, "When alone I proceed through myself."

Not just Tozan, everybody. I have to walk alone by myself, no matter what happens. This is not being egoistic; there is just no one who can substitute for me.

When it comes time for me to die, who can substitute for me?

No one. Even if you tried, it would be impossible. So all I have to do is to just go ahead and die. Even though I scream, or laugh, or cry, no matter what I say or do, I must proceed alone into death.

Together with the whole world.

***

When a dying Buddhist comes to a Zen master and asks for some words of sympathy and relief, the Zen master will say, "please, go ahead, quietly."

That means, when you have to die, just go ahead and die, quietly. it seems cold, but it is very true. The Zen master understands pretty well what life and death are. So "alone I proceed through myself." "Through myself" means through this body, right here, right now. Why this body? Because there is no other choice.

Wherever I may go, I meet this reflection. He is completely myself but simultaneously he is not me. But only the True Self is going along. Yet the reflection is what we discuss, what we stumble over all the time. So we say this is me, this is you; but it is not you, and it is not I.

"Only if you understand this will you unite with the Tathagata." "This" means Big Self, True Self. "Tathagata" comes from two words, "Tatha," meaning "going," and "agata," meaning "coming;" so it means something that is going and coming. That is the truth, the vastness of existence. Before your thought or feelings, there is something there: the vastness of existence.

Is this vastness of existence then nothing? We call it "emptiness," but there is something there. It is always coming, and it is always going. So when you see the reflection it is coming but in the next moment it is going. When the reflection is gone, you say "this is not me;" but immediately the reflection comes.

So without this reflection 1 cannot exist, I cannot understand who I am. But that reflection is always coming and going; it does not stay even for a moment. The only thing that stays is the vastness of existence. That is called truth, or in Japanese, "hokyo:" the Jewel Mirror.

Manzan said that the Jewel Mirror was a metaphor for wisdom, and that he took great pity on those who did not realize wisdom; the greatest sadness in the world was not to realize wisdom.

This wisdom is not a matter of words and discussion. This wisdom is the truth, Big Self, the Real Self.

When I alone proceed through myself, then there is wisdom.

If you think about it, proceeding alone is very hard. Because no one can really reach you or help you. We can communicate by means of language, send each other words of sympathy and encouragement. But no matter what words you send me, 1 alone proceed through myself. It is very hard to stay there, with aloneness.

But there is no other way. Whatever you say, whatever opinion you have, you have to just proceed alone through yourself within this world. When you let your True Self proceed, this proceeding is called wisdom.

Wisdom is not a matter of philosophical discussion. Wisdom constantly shows us the real principle of human life.

We can call this principle of existence what we want: Truth, Buddha, Dharmakaya, whatever. But any kind of concept must be personalized. You must experience it. At that time it becomes wisdom.

So the realization of the principle of existence is wisdom, a very deep understanding of the human world, which no one can ignore.

Wisdom lets you look with depth and penetration into the the core of human existence, and simultaneously guides you in your practice. Without practice, wisdom doesn't make sense.

The practice of wisdom is the practice of samadhi. One-pointedness. And the simplest practice of samadhi is Zazen.

***
Buddhism, and particularly the Prajna Paramita Sutra, places great stress on the Wisdom of Emptiness. Wisdom of Emptiness is the realization that the human world has no substantiality of its own

No substantiality of its own means that there is no single thing to pin down, to count, to explain, to know, or to understand as an independent entity.

But you can be there. Just be; that is the Wisdom of Emptiness, emphasized so much in the Prajna Paramita.

***

There are three aspects to the Wisdom of Emptiness: Emptiness of the Conditioned, the Emptiness of the Unconditioned, and Ultimate Emptiness.

Emptiness of the Conditioned means emptiness of the phenomenal world.

The human world.

What you see, what you hear, what you think and experience, all things visible and invisible. All sentient beings.

What you see through your six senses is constantly changing. So there is nothing to pin down.

So does your heart beat because of your efforts? Yes, it does. But on the other hand, it does not.

It does, because if you don't take care of your health, pretty soon there will be no more heartbeats. It does not, because your heart beats or doesn't beat no matter what you think.

But that shouldn't cause you to ignore your heart. You should appreciate it, and take good care of your health. Because each heartbeat is an indication of your existence. Totally interconnected, interpenetrated with all other sentient beings.

We don't know what a heartbeat is, but our heart beats anyway. As a whole, before you think or do not think. This is the life of a beating heart.

Now when I use the term "life," I don't mean just life in the biological sense, or what some people call "life force." I mean something more than that. I mean that impulse which makes something exist, right in the middle of emptiness. So everything has a life. Trees, birds, rocks, this table, everything. And this life is impermanent.

One Japanese alphabet, Hirakana, is made up of fourty-seven syllables. Kobo Daishi, the founder of Esoteric Buddhism in Japan, took these syllables and made a poem by grouping them into words:

> Though flowers bloom, they soon fall.  
> How can this life be permanent to anyone?  
>  Crossing the mountains of life's vicissitudes today, 
> We shall not have light dreams or be infatuated again.

So even first grade children, by repeating their alphabet, are saying this poem. Even before they learn the meaning of the words. So when you grow up with the Japanese language you very naturally experience the emptiness of the world. Emptiness in the sense that everything is constantly moving, functioning dynamically, constantly working.

So there is nothing to grasp.

But it is not pessimistic. Reading a poem like this naturally makes you somewhat pensive and sad; but this sadness results from your looking at life as a kind of object that you want to hold on to. If you see your life exactly as it is then there is no way to feel pensive. Because your life is constantly emerging. You have to take care of it, every day, no matter what happens. You have to move forward; deal with life and let it pass by, and not let yourself be dragged around by your ideas and thoughts.

Ideas and thoughts are important, but they should come from this emptiness of life, this dynamic function of life. In other words, first you should be alive. Then you should think and create ideas and concepts. Usually we do it the other way around. And so we are dragged around by our ideas, and the result is all the crying and laughing and screaming and fighting that we see around us.

So that pensiveness or sadness we get from much of Japanese literature is normal. But don't think that you can realize the impermanence of life by reading novels. Impermanence is something more serious than that. It is something you must taste directly, in your own life.

***

So that is the Emptiness of the Conditioned. The second aspect of the Wisdom of Emptiness is the Emptiness of the Unconditioned.

When I say "Unconditioned" I mean the experience of the truth, sometimes called spiritual fascination or ecstasy. If you practice the spiritual life and practice it hard, sooner or later you will experience something of the truth. Then you may attach to this experience and try to hold on to it. But in fact that : experience is empty just like anything else. Constantly changing, constantly coming and going, with nothing to grasp.

That is why Manzan said that Zen with no wisdom gives rise to the demons of meditation. This means that you can become crazed by zazen or by enlightenment.

In the Zazen Yojinki the Zen master Keizan describes the experience of the demons of meditation. He says:

> "When sitting in meditation, your body may seem hot or cold, uneasy or comfortable, sometimes stiff, sometimes loose, sometimes heavy, sometimes light, sometimes startled awake."

Have you experienced that?

Even though it is winter, if you do zazen very seriously you become warm. Sometimes your body is very dull, sometimes it is very sharp. Very sensitive. Sometimes you sit there just like a rock. Other times you are soft, just like a jellyfish.

If you sit down in the ordinary way, just to relax, then this may trigger the demons of meditation. If you feel them, or your body feels overly irritable, you should check your breathing.

It is very important to breathe harmoniously during zazen. To harmonize your breathing, just open your mouth for a while and breathe through it. If a short breath comes, breathe short; if long breath comes, breathe long. Wisely harmonize your breathing and follow it naturally. When the timing comes easy and natural, shift your breathing to your nose. When breathing and mind are not coordinated, then zazen sickness arises.

For example, you feel like your body is sinking to the bottom of the ocean, or shrinking down to the size of a tiny insect. Or you feel your body becoming huge and what you're looking at becomes very small. Sometimes your body feels very insubstantial, like a fog; sometimes your body and mind becomes very sharp and attentive. If a pin dropped outside you could hear it.

Sometimes you will experience supernatural powers. Even though Buddhist teaching talks about the six supernatural powers, if you attach to them then they just become zazen sickness. You think you can travel inside your body. You can hear your heart very clearly, or touch your nerves, or hear sounds at the corner of your head. Sounds of people talking about something. You don't want to hear it, but you can. So in a sense your mind has become very sharp and sensitive.

Maybe you see a beautiful image of the Buddha, or a Bodhisattva. Sometimes you see light, all different colors, sometimes silver or gold. Or you look at a little dot on the floor and it looks like a lion's head, or a human body. And then these things give birth to corrupting thoughts. You think, "Oh, my thoughts have stopped now!"

Other times, when you are just sitting and your mind is very clear, the meaning of some difficult passage in a Sutra comes up even though you are not thinking about it. This is very natural. When water is very still, even tiny things become very conspicuous. On the surface of a serene pond, even a tiny bubble is clearly visible. When the surface is rough and stirred up, you cannot see it. So naturally when you do zazen you can see many things.

Sometimes people bring along paper and pencil and try to take notes of these thoughts. They are afraid they will forget. That makes zazen a part-time job.

Zazen is not a part-time job. So leave the paper and pencil behind. If it is important, you won't forget it. It remains with you, and some day it will come up. And if it disappears after zazen, well, that's all right too. For it's already gone.

When you have these symptoms it means your mind and breathing are not in harmony, or you are trying to use zazen to achieve some kind of object. Which is why Menzan said that Zen without wisdom gives rise to the demons of meditation.

So whatever you see during zazen, even spiritual ecstasy, or enlightenment, or Buddha's face, whatever, it's just emptiness. The Emptiness of the Unconditioned. You have to let it go.

Let it be.

If you touch it, it is no longer the Unconditioned. It's something you have created. You have made the Unconditioned into the Conditioned. If you experience the Unconditioned, that's fine. But let it be.

***

So that is the second aspect, the Wisdom of the Unconditioned. The third is the Ultimate Emptiness.

Ultimate Emptiness means being completely without attachment to anything.

Even Zen.

Just proceed through yourself, alone. It's very simple to describe, but it's very hard to practice this way. It is very easy for us to attach to the conditioned or the unconditioned world. Especially the unconditioned world, because it is mysterious. We are always curious about mysteries.

Occasionally people will say, "Katagiri is fine, but Katagiri is not the best teacher." And then they will compare me to some other teacher, who is supposed to be able to walk on air. His body touches the floor but he doesn't touch the floor, he just walks on air.

It sounds fantastic, but I am not interested. Other people may be curious, but it is just the Emptiness of the Unconditioned. If you grasp something like this and try to hold it, it just becomes delusion.

So all you have to do, completely beyond Conditioned or Unconditioned, is just proceed. By yourself. That is a very simple practice, but it is very hard. Wherever you may go, this alone is the way we all experience the Ultimate Emptiness. A very good example is life and death, which is why life and death is the most important problem in Zen.

In the Ultimate Emptiness, there are no ideas or concepts, even of Emptiness. If you say "Emptiness," then you have created an element of the Conditioned world. Or if you say "Emptiness is Nothing, " you have also created a Conditioned element.

Ultimate Emptiness means just walk.

Proceed with your practice, straight, without going this way or that.

So, right now, just go.

Next moment, just go.

Next moment, just go your way.

It's very simple, but it is very hard, to let wisdom guide you and to act. Very hard.

But when you do gassho, just gassho. When you die, just die. When you live, just live. It's very simple.

But we don't understand it. And we don't understand how our understanding is perverted. And we don't understand that simple way of life, to just go in the realm of emptiness.

And so we become confused and carried away by our ignorance.

Ignorance means you don't understand what's going on here. You don't understand why you are here, or why you are doing zazen. That is called ignorance. Ignorant people are always in a hurry. How can they do anything in a proper way? How can they live without causing trouble and confusion?

We don't know where this ignorance comes from.

You can say your parents, but that is just a probable reason. We don't really know.

Why am I Japanese?

One time I spoke in Chicago. I was just sitting there on the top floor, waiting for questions, and this young American woman asked me why my mouth was just like one line.

It was pretty hard to answer, because I hadn't created it on purpose.

So I just said, "Why were you born an American?"

Speaking is really very interesting. It is one of the ways I hope to avoid ignorance, by poking away into every nook and cranny, just like a cat.

***

So Ultimate Emptiness is exactly what you can do, in the simplest way, from moment to moment. At that time you can experience it. Beyond your idea of experience, it is the true experience.

Because we are really walking in the mist.

Wisdom, Truth, Big Self, whatever you say and whatever I say, everything becomes a mist.

I say your life is just you, no one helping. You don't understand what this Big Self is; if you try to grasp it, it becomes just like a mist.

Even though I say that your life is pretty good, that you have success, and will become a great person, that too is like a mist.

Because our life goes on in this limited world, and each moment is a kind of crisis; we never know when it all may be destroyed, ruined, when we die.

Worldly possessions, success and failure, social status are all like a mist.

You cannot ignore success and failure, but you can experience it as something insubstantial, like a mist. And as Dogen Zenji said, when you walk in the mist, before you are conscious of it, your clothes become wet. So before anything you think of as an experience, you experience the Ultimate Emptiness.

What you experience is wisdom. So wisdom is really not something we discuss, wisdom is something we manifest. When we walk in the mist. And when wisdom becomes actualized it is called Samadhi.

So samadhi means right acceptance. Right acceptance is not opposed to wrong acceptance. Wrong acceptance means to accept something dualistically, like it is an object outside of you, something you can create and hold. At that time there is wrong acceptance, because you cannot really create and hold onto any of these things: fame, or health, or happiness.

But we try. We exercise every day, to get healthy. And we do everything with this object in mind of making our life happy or good. We do yoga exercises and zazen exercises, and we study, and master some skill or another, and make money, always with some outside object in mind. And then we believe that this is the best way to live.

I don't think so.

Because when you die you lose all these objects and you become very unhappy.

So what we should do is just walk.

This is called samadhi. Samadhi is right acceptance; accepting something, but not from the dualistic point of view.

Completely beyond like or don't like or feel so-so, you alone proceed through yourself. Interconnected, interpenetrated, with all sentient beings. Just do whatever you do at that moment with whole heart, true heart.

This is called, "you alone proceed."

This is samadhi.

Zazen is a very simple manifestation of this samadhi.

This is why we do zazen.

Now I don't think anybody really likes zazen, particularly during sesshin. If you don't like zazen, then why don't you quit? But you tell me you cannot quit. So it is something beyond like or dislike. You accept zazen totally, as a whole.

Another aspect of right acceptance is accepting yourself without competing with others. If you are Katagiri, just be Katagiri as he is, without comparison to others.

If I am a violet all I have to do is wait for the violet to bloom. I don't have to imitate a rose. I am a violet all by myself. No one helps me, and there is no one to imitate.

Then maybe you say, which will I be, a violet or a rose? That is already making comparisons, and I am not talking about comparisons.

You are already something. Before you compare yourself with somebody else, you are already you. All you have to do is let the flow of your life force to cause you to bloom as you really are.

In the Teno Kyokun, by Dogen Zenji, we find the passage:

> "Put those things that naturally go on a high place onto a high place, and those that would be most stable on a low place onto a low place; things that naturally belong on a high place settle best on a high place, while those that belong on a low place find their greatest stability there."

This is a very important passage; you should consider it again and again.

If you go to work for a company, the company will do many things to get your life force to bloom. But if you are a violet, they will tell you not to bloom as a Violet but to bloom as a rose. So they will do things like put up lists of who is the best saleman or some such thing.

That's pretty nice, in a sense, because it seems to be encouragement. But encouragement is not always good for you. If it makes you see the world dualistically, then it makes you nervous. You can accept your life when things are going well. But when things are not going well you become very depressed.
Nervous. Sick. You can die from it.

That's why you can look around and see so many nervous people. Even when they have money and high social status, and what appears to be a very nice life. Because they are really violets and they are trying to bloom like roses.

So something which belongs on a high place should be in a high place and something that belongs on a low place should be on a low one. "High" and "low" do not mean rank or status. They just mean different places. So this means Katagiri is Katagiri.

No one can imitate the way I speak as a teacher, no one can follow me in life, no one can help me in the basic things like facing death. That's why we understand each other: I cannot help you and you cannot help me.

If we could truly help each other, no one would have to die. But whatever we do, we have to die. And so we can be sympathetic with each other. The Buddha said:

> Who do I love best in this world?
> 
> I love myself best in this world.

This is true of everyone, don't you think?

I can say that I will help all sentient beings, but I cannot really trust myself to do that. I always like myself best.
Particularly in a dangerous situation. Even in a case where my wife and children are in the middle of the ocean, can I trust myself to help my wife first?

I cannot say so.

Because I know myself how egoistic I am.

That's why we must be sympathetic. That's why the Buddha said, if everyone likes himself best in this whole world, then don't hurt others.

That's a very good saying. You like yourself, 1 like myself, so why do I have to hurt you? Why do we have all this killing in this world?

So put up something which should be on a high place and put something which should be on a low place down where it ought to be. That's very natural.

So when I look at myself, sometimes I feel good and sometimes I don't feel good, because everything in life is up and down. But there is no way to escape this up and down. So basically I must Just accept, just stand up and proceed. With stability. By myself.

Then I can experience up and down, and take care of it. If I don't proceed by myself, stably, how can I survive an up and down life? And so you should read this passage in the Tenzo Kyokan, and consider it again and again.
