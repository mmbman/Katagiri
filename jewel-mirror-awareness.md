### Introduction

This is a song.

In Japanese we call it *Hôkyozammai*, “Jewel Mirror Awareness,” omitting the word “Song.” But Manzan, a famous Japanese Zen master, stressed that the title should include the word “Song.” For this is not only a very important sutra: it is a song, one which is chanted every day in Soto Zen monasteries.

A song appeals very deeply to your heart, and impresses you very much. Even if you don’t understand it. We learn songs as children, often singing them before we understand what the words mean, and as adults we still remember them.

This is why it is called the “Song of Jewel Mirror Awareness.” “Awareness” of course means “samadhi.” The Song of Jewel Mirror Samadhi.

So here we have a song which is also a very important sutra. You should recite it as well as study it, so that it becomes as much of you as a song of your childhood.

The *Song of Jewel Mirror Awareness* is a very simple sutra, consisting of 376 Chinese characters arranged into 94 phrases. It was written by the Zen Master Tozan, who lived from 807 to 865, and who is greatly respected as the founder of the Sotö tradition of Zen Buddhism. He also systematized the philosophical background of Soto Zen teaching into the so-called “Five Ranks.”

<p align="center">* * *</p>

Tozan practiced under the guidance of Ungan. One day he was to leave his teacher and set out on a pilgrimage to other Zen temples. Before he left, Tozan asked Ungan:

“After you have passed away, how can I answer someone who asks me what you were like?”

Ungan replied, “Say to him, just this is.” Ungan then went on to say, “You must now be very careful, as you are carrying this great thing. Consider it again and again.”

Do you see what Ungan meant by “Just this is?”

Tozan went on his travels, always pondering this statement “Just this is.” Then one day he was crossing a body of water and saw his image reflected there. Immediately he understood the teaching of Ungan, and composed the following gatha:

> You shouldn’t search it outwardly  
> If you do, the truth will become more remote from you.  
> But when alone I proceed through myself,  
> Wherever I go I meet him.  
> Now he is not other than myself, yet I am not he.  
> Only if you understand this will you unite with the Tathägata.  

If you want to seek the truth you cannot search for it outwardly. If you do, the truth will become more and more remote from you. The more you conceptualize, the more you try to achieve objective and rational understanding, the more complex and distant the truth will become. But in fact the truth is really very simple.

Tozan realized this and understood Ungan’s teaching when he saw his image in the water. A reflection. So he very naturally saw that the reflection was not himself, that there was something, Big Self, True Self, beyond the reflection in the water.

Who could this be?

“When alone I proceed through myself.” When you walk alone, when there is really the truth, Big Self.

“Wherever I go, I meet him.” So True Self meets that reflection wherever it goes. And, “He is not other than myself.” So True Self and reflection cannot be separated. True Self does not float around like some kind of spirit or ghost. But, “I am not he.” So there is more to us than the reflection that our senses perceive. But on the other hand, reflection must be there, or there is nothing for us to see.

So, wherever we may go, we see the reflection. And this leads people to believe that the reflection is their true selves.

That is a completely perverted view.

But that does not mean we can ignore that reflection. Reflection is not the truth, yet without the refection we cannot see the truth.

So where is real truth, True Self?

Outside, or inside of you?

Exactly neither.

Because if you say outside, then you are just seeking the truth outside of yourself, and it will get farther and farther away from you, become more and more conceptualized and artificial. If you say inside, you are still seeking the truth through your ordinary consciousness, objectively. What inside part of you is it?

Not “inside,” not “outside.” True Self is completely beyond our ability to discuss in words.

We can use language to create concepts and words, to see things objectively. When we think this way, we say that we understand, or that we know or don’t know about something. But True Self exists completely outside any system of concepts. It is not something that we can capture in words and symbols.

It is something alive.

It is life itself, real life.

<p align="center">* * *</p>

You don’t think consciously about your breath or the beating of our heart when you go to sleep. If you did, you would become very nervous; maybe even schizophrenic. Even though you sleep, your heart keeps on beating. But there is no guarantee that your heart will keep on beating. Because a beating heart is something that belongs to this limited world. There is uncertainty with each heartbeat, a kind of crisis. Because you don’t know whether or not your heart is going to stop. So your heart exists within the limits of its own life, and also in a state of crisis.

What, then, is a beating heart?

Is it some kind of object that you can grasp? There is some kind of object there, but it is not a beating heart. If it were, then when your heart stopped you could pour heartbeats into it, like gasoline into a car. But you can’t. So should we worry about each heartbeat when we go to bed? No, because we would go crazy.

What, then, is it?

It is the real truth, beyond your ability to put into words or concepts. Before a conscious thought arises or does not arise, your heart beats. From moment to moment your heart is alive. And something which is alive is something which is interconnected, interpenetrated with all sentient beings. “All sentient beings” means more beings, visible and invisible, than you can see with your eyes, smell with your nose, or grasp with your mind.

This is the real life of a beating heart.

The aliveness of life. Always interconnected, interpenetrated with all beings. This is completely beyond your thinking. Before you think or don’t think, there is real life.

So then where is Big Self, True Self?

Inside or outside? No way.

If you say inside or outside you have used a word to represent an object separate from you. But before even the thought of that word there was something alive, a kind of impulse. After that impulse comes your thoughts and concepts and all the other objects you create in your life.

So there is something before thought.

Without that something, nothing can be created. We call it real life, Big Self, True Self. Only the True Self goes alone. That’s why Tozan says, “When alone I proceed through myself.”

Not just Tozan, everybody. I have to walk alone by myself, no matter what happens. This is not being egoistic; there is just no one who can substitute for me.

When it comes time for me to die, who can substitute for me?

No one. Even if you tried, it would be impossible. So all I have to do is to just go ahead and die. Even though I scream, or laugh, or cry, no matter what I say or do, I must proceed alone into death.

Together with the whole world.

<p align="center">* * *</p>

When a dying Buddhist comes to a Zen master and asks for some words of sympathy and relief, the Zen master will say, “please, go ahead, quietly.”

That means, when you have to die, just go ahead and die, quietly. It seems cold, but it is very true. The Zen master understands pretty well what life and death are. So “alone I proceed through myself.” “Through myself” means through this body, right here, right now. Why this body? Because there is no other choice.

Wherever I may go, I meet this reflection. He is completely myself but simultaneously he is not me. But only the True Self is going along. Yet the reflection is what we discuss, what we stumble over all the time. So we say this is me, this is you; but it is not you, and it is not I.

“Only if you understand this will you unite with the Tathagata.” “This” means Big Self, True Self. “Tathagata” comes from two words, “Tatha,” meaning “going,” and “agata,” meaning “coming;” so it means something that is going and coming. That is the truth, the vastness of existence. Before your thought or feelings, there is something there: the vastness of existence.

Is this vastness of existence then nothing? We call it “emptiness,” but there is something there. It is always coming, and it is always going. So when you see the reflection it is coming but in the next moment it is going. When the reflection is gone, you say “this is not me;” but immediately the reflection comes.

So without this reflection I cannot exist, I cannot understand who I am. But that reflection is always coming and going; it does not stay even for a moment. The only thing that stays is the vastness of existence. That is called truth, or in Japanese, “hokyo:” the Jewel Mirror.

Manzan said that the Jewel Mirror was a metaphor for wisdom, and that he took great pity on those who did not realize wisdom; the greatest sadness in the world was not to realize wisdom.

This wisdom is not a matter of words and discussion. This wisdom is the truth, Big Self, the Real Self.

When I alone proceed through myself, then there is wisdom.

If you think about it, proceeding alone is very hard. Because no one can really reach you or help you. We can communicate by means of language, send each other words of sympathy and encouragement. But no matter what words you send me, I alone proceed through myself. It is very hard to stay there, with aloneness.

But there is no other way. Whatever you say, whatever opinion you have, you have to just proceed alone through yourself within this world. When you let your True Self proceed, this proceeding is called wisdom.

Wisdom is not a matter of philosophical discussion. Wisdom constantly shows us the real principle of human life.

We can call this principle of existence what we want: Truth, Buddha, Dharmakaya, whatever. But any kind of concept must be personalized. You must experience it. At that time it becomes wisdom.

So the realization of the principle of existence is wisdom, a very deep understanding of the human world, which no one can ignore.

Wisdom lets you look with depth and penetration into the the core of human existence, and simultaneously guides you in your practice. Without practice, wisdom doesn’t make sense.

The practice of wisdom is the practice of samadhi. One-pointedness. And the simplest practice of samadhi is Zazen.

<p align="center">* * *</p>

Buddhism, and particularly the Prajna Paramita Sutra, places great stress on the Wisdom of Emptiness. Wisdom of Emptiness is the realization that the human world has no substantiality of its own.

No substantiality of its own means that there is no single thing to pin down, to count, to explain, to know, or to understand as an independent entity.

But you can be there. Just be; that is the Wisdom of Emptiness, emphasized so much in the Prajna Paramita.

<p align="center">* * *</p>

There are three aspects to the Wisdom of Emptiness: Emptiness of the Conditioned, the Emptiness of the Unconditioned, and Ultimate Emptiness.

Emptiness of the Conditioned means emptiness of the phenomenal world.

The human world.

What you see, what you hear, what you think and experience, all things visible and invisible. All sentient beings.

What you see through your six senses is constantly changing. So there is nothing to pin down.

So does your heart beat because of your efforts? Yes, it does. But on the other hand, it does not.

It does, because if you don’t take care of your health, pretty soon there will be no more heartbeats. It does not, because your heart beats or doesn’t beat no matter what you think.

But that shouldn’t cause you to ignore your heart. You should appreciate it, and take good care of your health. Because each heartbeat is an indication of your existence. Totally interconnected, interpenetrated with all other sentient beings.

We don’t know what a heartbeat is, but our heart beats anyway. As a whole, before you think or do not think. This is the life of a beating heart.

Now when I use the term “life,” I don’t mean just life in the biological sense, or what some people call “life force.” I mean something more than that. I mean that impulse which makes something exist, right in the middle of emptiness. So everything has a life. Trees, birds, rocks, this table, everything. And this life is impermanent.

One Japanese alphabet, Hirakana, is made up of fourty-seven syllables. Kobo Daishi, the founder of Esoteric Buddhism in Japan, took these syllables and made a poem by grouping them into words:

> Though flowers bloom, they soon fall.  
> How can this life be permanent to anyone?  
> Crossing the mountains of life’s vicissitudes today,  
> We shall not have light dreams or be infatuated again.  

So even first grade children, by repeating their alphabet, are saying this poem. Even before they learn the meaning of the words. So when you grow up with the Japanese language you very naturally experience the emptiness of the world. Emptiness in the sense that everything is constantly moving, functioning dynamically, constantly working.

So there is nothing to grasp.

But it is not pessimistic. Reading a poem like this naturally makes you somewhat pensive and sad; but this sadness results from your looking at life as a kind of object that you want to hold on to. If you see your life exactly as it is then there is no way to feel pensive. Because your life is constantly emerging. You have to take care of it, every day, no matter what happens. You have to move forward; deal with life and let it pass by, and not let yourself be dragged around by your ideas and thoughts.

Ideas and thoughts are important, but they should come from this emptiness of life, this dynamic function of life. In other words, first you should be alive. Then you should think and create ideas and concepts. Usually we do it the other way around. And so we are dragged around by our ideas, and the result is all the crying and laughing and screaming and fighting that we see around us.

So that pensiveness or sadness we get from much of Japanese literature is normal. But don’t think that you can realize the impermanence of life by reading novels. Impermanence is something more serious than that. It is something you must taste directly, in your own life.

<p align="center">* * *</p>

So that is the Emptiness of the Conditioned. The second aspect of the Wisdom of Emptiness is the Emptiness of the Unconditioned.

When I say “Unconditioned” I mean the experience of the truth, sometimes called spiritual fascination or ecstasy. If you practice the spiritual life and practice it hard, sooner or later you will experience something of the truth. Then you may attach to this experience and try to hold on to it. But in fact that : experience is empty just like anything else. Constantly changing, constantly coming and going, with nothing to grasp.

That is why Manzan said that Zen with no wisdom gives rise to the demons of meditation. This means that you can become crazed by zazen or by enlightenment.

In the Zazen Yojinki the Zen master Keizan describes the experience of the demons of meditation. He says:

> “When sitting in meditation, your body may seem hot or cold, uneasy or comfortable, sometimes stiff, sometimes loose, sometimes heavy, sometimes light, sometimes startled awake.”

Have you experienced that?

Even though it is winter, if you do zazen very seriously you become warm. Sometimes your body is very dull, sometimes it is very sharp. Very sensitive. Sometimes you sit there just like a rock. Other times you are soft, just like a jellyfish.

If you sit down in the ordinary way, just to relax, then this may trigger the demons of meditation. If you feel them, or your body feels overly irritable, you should check your breathing.

It is very important to breathe harmoniously during zazen. To harmonize your breathing, just open your mouth for a while and breathe through it. If a short breath comes, breathe short; if long breath comes, breathe long. Wisely harmonize your breathing and follow it naturally. When the timing comes easy and natural, shift your breathing to your nose. When breathing and mind are not coordinated, then zazen sickness arises.

For example, you feel like your body is sinking to the bottom of the ocean, or shrinking down to the size of a tiny insect. Or you feel your body becoming huge and what you’re looking at becomes very small. Sometimes your body feels very insubstantial, like a fog; sometimes your body and mind becomes very sharp and attentive. If a pin dropped outside you could hear it.

Sometimes you will experience supernatural powers. Even though Buddhist teaching talks about the six supernatural powers, if you attach to them then they just become zazen sickness. You think you can travel inside your body. You can hear your heart very clearly, or touch your nerves, or hear sounds at the corner of your head. Sounds of people talking about something. You don’t want to hear it, but you can. So in a sense your mind has become very sharp and sensitive.

Maybe you see a beautiful image of the Buddha, or a Bodhisattva. Sometimes you see light, all different colors, sometimes silver or gold. Or you look at a little dot on the floor and it looks like a lion’s head, or a human body. And then these things give birth to corrupting thoughts. You think, “Oh, my thoughts have stopped now!”

Other times, when you are just sitting and your mind is very clear, the meaning of some difficult passage in a Sutra comes up even though you are not thinking about it. This is very natural. When water is very still, even tiny things become very conspicuous. On the surface of a serene pond, even a tiny bubble is clearly visible. When the surface is rough and stirred up, you cannot see it. So naturally when you do zazen you can see many things.

Sometimes people bring along paper and pencil and try to take notes of these thoughts. They are afraid they will forget. That makes zazen a part-time job.

Zazen is not a part-time job. So leave the paper and pencil behind. If it is important, you won’t forget it. It remains with you, and some day it will come up. And if it disappears after zazen, well, that’s all right too. For it’s already gone.

When you have these symptoms it means your mind and breathing are not in harmony, or you are trying to use zazen to achieve some kind of object. Which is why Menzan said that Zen without wisdom gives rise to the demons of meditation.

So whatever you see during zazen, even spiritual ecstasy, or enlightenment, or Buddha’s face, whatever, it’s just emptiness. The Emptiness of the Unconditioned. You have to let it go.

Let it be.

If you touch it, it is no longer the Unconditioned. It’s something you have created. You have made the Unconditioned into the Conditioned. If you experience the Unconditioned, that’s fine. But let it be.

<p align="center">* * *</p>

So that is the second aspect, the Wisdom of the Unconditioned. The third is the Ultimate Emptiness.

Ultimate Emptiness means being completely without attachment to anything.

Even Zen.

Just proceed through yourself, alone. It’s very simple to describe, but it’s very hard to practice this way. It is very easy for us to attach to the conditioned or the unconditioned world. Especially the unconditioned world, because it is mysterious. We are always curious about mysteries.

Occasionally people will say, “Katagiri is fine, but Katagiri is not the best teacher.” And then they will compare me to some other teacher, who is supposed to be able to walk on air. His body touches the floor but he doesn’t touch the floor, he just walks on air.

It sounds fantastic, but I am not interested. Other people may be curious, but it is just the Emptiness of the Unconditioned. If you grasp something like this and try to hold it, it just becomes delusion.

So all you have to do, completely beyond Conditioned or Unconditioned, is just proceed. By yourself. That is a very simple practice, but it is very hard. Wherever you may go, this alone is the way we all experience the Ultimate Emptiness. A very good example is life and death, which is why life and death is the most important problem in Zen.

In the Ultimate Emptiness, there are no ideas or concepts, even of Emptiness. If you say “Emptiness,” then you have created an element of the Conditioned world. Or if you say “Emptiness is Nothing, “ you have also created a Conditioned element.

Ultimate Emptiness means just walk. Proceed with your practice, straight, without going this way or that.

So, right now, just go.

Next moment, just go.

Next moment, just go your way.

It’s very simple, but it is very hard, to let wisdom guide you and to act. Very hard.

But when you do gassho, just gassho. When you die, just die. When you live, just live. It’s very simple.

But we don’t understand it. And we don’t understand how our understanding is perverted. And we don’t understand that simple way of life, to just go in the realm of emptiness.

And so we become confused and carried away by our ignorance.

Ignorance means you don’t understand what’s going on here. You don’t understand why you are here, or why you are doing zazen. That is called ignorance. Ignorant people are always in a hurry. How can they do anything in a proper way? How can they live without causing trouble and confusion?

We don’t know where this ignorance comes from.

You can say your parents, but that is just a probable reason. We don’t really know.

Why am I Japanese?

One time I spoke in Chicago. I was just sitting there on the top floor, waiting for questions, and this young American woman asked me why my mouth was just like one line.

It was pretty hard to answer, because I hadn’t created it on purpose.

So I just said, “Why were you born an American?”

Speaking is really very interesting. It is one of the ways I hope to avoid ignorance, by poking away into every nook and cranny, just like a cat.

<p align="center">* * *</p>

So Ultimate Emptiness is exactly what you can do, in the simplest way, from moment to moment. At that time you can experience it. Beyond your idea of experience, it is the true experience.

Because we are really walking in the mist.

Wisdom, Truth, Big Self, whatever you say and whatever I say, everything becomes a mist.

I say your life is just you, no one helping. You don’t understand what this Big Self is; if you try to grasp it, it becomes just like a mist.

Even though I say that your life is pretty good, that you have success, and will become a great person, that too is like a mist.

Because our life goes on in this limited world, and each moment is a kind of crisis; we never know when it all may be destroyed, ruined, when we die.

Worldly possessions, success and failure, social status are all like a mist.

You cannot ignore success and failure, but you can experience it as something insubstantial, like a mist. And as Dogen Zenji said, when you walk in the mist, before you are conscious of it, your clothes become wet. So before anything you think of as an experience, you experience the Ultimate Emptiness.

What you experience is wisdom. So wisdom is really not something we discuss, wisdom is something we manifest. When we walk in the mist. And when wisdom becomes actualized it is called *samadhi*.

So *samadhi* means right acceptance. Right acceptance is not opposed to wrong acceptance. Wrong acceptance means to accept something dualistically, like it is an object outside of you, something you can create and hold. At that time there is wrong acceptance, because you cannot really create and hold onto any of these things: fame, or health, or happiness.

But we try. We exercise every day, to get healthy. And we do everything with this object in mind of making our life happy or good. We do yoga exercises and zazen exercises, and we study, and master some skill or another, and make money, always with some outside object in mind. And then we believe that this is the best way to live.

I don’t think so.

Because when you die you lose all these objects and you become very unhappy.

So what we should do is just walk.

This is called samadhi. Samadhi is right acceptance; accepting something, but not from the dualistic point of view.

Completely beyond like or don’t like or feel so-so, you alone proceed through yourself. Interconnected, interpenetrated, with all sentient beings. Just do whatever you do at that moment with whole heart, true heart.

This is called, “you alone proceed.”

This is samadhi.

Zazen is a very simple manifestation of this samadhi.

This is why we do zazen.

Now I don’t think anybody really likes zazen, particularly during sesshin. If you don’t like zazen, then why don’t you quit? But you tell me you cannot quit. So it is something beyond like or dislike. You accept zazen totally, as a whole.

Another aspect of right acceptance is accepting yourself without competing with others. If you are Katagiri, just be Katagiri as he is, without comparison to others.

If I am a violet all I have to do is wait for the violet to bloom. I don’t have to imitate a rose. I am a violet all by myself. No one helps me, and there is no one to imitate.

Then maybe you say, which will I be, a violet or a rose? That is already making comparisons, and I am not talking about comparisons.

You are already something. Before you compare yourself with somebody else, you are already you. All you have to do is let the flow of your life force to cause you to bloom as you really are.

In the Tenzo Kyokun, by Dogen Zenji, we find the passage:

> “Put those things that naturally go on a high place onto a high place, and those that would be most stable on a low place onto a low place; things that naturally belong on a high place settle best on a high place, while those that belong on a low place find their greatest stability there.”

This is a very important passage; you should consider it again and again.

If you go to work for a company, the company will do many things to get your life force to bloom. But if you are a violet, they will tell you not to bloom as a Violet but to bloom as a rose. So they will do things like put up lists of who is the best salesman or some such thing.

That’s pretty nice, in a sense, because it seems to be encouragement. But encouragement is not always good for you. If it makes you see the world dualistically, then it makes you nervous. You can accept your life when things are going well. But when things are not going well you become very depressed. Nervous. Sick. You can die from it.

That’s why you can look around and see so many nervous people. Even when they have money and high social status, and what appears to be a very nice life. Because they are really violets and they are trying to bloom like roses.

So something which belongs on a high place should be in a high place and something that belongs on a low place should be on a low one. “High” and “low” do not mean rank or status. They just mean different places. So this means Katagiri is Katagiri.

No one can imitate the way I speak as a teacher, no one can follow me in life, no one can help me in the basic things like facing death. That’s why we understand each other: I cannot help you and you cannot help me.

If we could truly help each other, no one would have to die. But whatever we do, we have to die. And so we can be sympathetic with each other. The Buddha said:

> Who do I love best in this world?
> 
> I love myself best in this world.

This is true of everyone, don’t you think?

I can say that I will help all sentient beings, but I cannot really trust myself to do that. I always like myself best. Particularly in a dangerous situation. Even in a case where my wife and children are in the middle of the ocean, can I trust myself to help my wife first?

I cannot say so. Because I know myself how egoistic I am.

That’s why we must be sympathetic. That’s why the Buddha said, if everyone likes himself best in this whole world, then don’t hurt others.

That’s a very good saying. You like yourself, I like myself, so why do I have to hurt you? Why do we have all this killing in this world?

So put up something which should be on a high place and put something which should be on a low place down where it ought to be. That’s very natural.

So when I look at myself, sometimes I feel good and sometimes I don’t feel good, because everything in life is up and down. But there is no way to escape this up and down. So basically I must just accept, just stand up and proceed. With stability. By myself.

Then I can experience up and down, and take care of it. If I don’t proceed by myself, stably, how can I survive an up and down life? And so you should read this passage in the Tenzo Kyokan, and consider it again and again.

### Part 1

#### Text:

> The teaching of thusness  
> Has been intimately communicated by buddhas and patriarchs;  
> Now you have it,  
> So keep it well.  

#### Commentary: 

In Japanese we use the word *nyoze* for “thusness.” The word is made up of two syllables, *nyo* and *ze*. *Nyo* means thus, or like, or likeness; *ze* means this, or something affirmative or assenting. *Nyo* can be taken to stand for the ultimate principle, and *ze* for the phenomenal world: thusness and thisness. Taken together they mean principle and practice. In English we say “thusness” or “suchness,” but you should think of it as principle and practice, ultimate principle and phenomena.

We combine them in one word because they are not separate.

Principle cannot exist alone, separate from practice. If it did, it would be like a dead tree: it would not live. So when you say principle, there must be practice; when you say practice there must be principle. Even though you don’t actually say the second word.

Then practice does not become the practice of something with blind or ignorant mind. Practice requires that you polish your mind through and through.

So we have “The teaching of *nyoze*.” “Teaching,” is, of course, *dharma*. Dharma has to be understood in three ways: as the ultimate principle, as phenomena, and as teaching. You may also understand dharma in terms of its working, as perfect harmony.

In terms of a purely intellectual understanding you can describe dharma as principle and phenomena, and analyze it in terms of parts. But in reality they are not separate; they must be completely harmonized. Interconnected, interpenetrated, in perfect harmony.

Then teaching must focus constantly on this perfect harmony of ultimate principle and phenomenal world. It cannot just be something written or spoken, or something conceptualized. It must be alive. It must remove suffering, and awaken people to the truth.

It must be something you manifest with your mind and your body as well as your mouth. Even without speaking, you can teach with your whole body the perfect harmony of ultimate truth and the phenomenal world.

That is why your behavior on a daily basis is so important. As is your talking. And your silence.

Silence teaches a lot.

If you don’t completely understand the meaning of the human world, then you should keep your mouth shut and contemplate. If you keep your mouth shut you will find that you can naturally go very deeply into the human world.

That is our practice.

Being silent does not mean being isolated from the human world. You should go very deeply into the human world; that is silence. Getting deeply into the human heart; this is silence.

So silence, human bodies, human words, all teach.

This is the dharma.

Generally speaking you should probably understand the dharma in terms of its working, as harmony. But this is still just a philosophical understanding. You have to put it into practice in your daily living.

You cannot talk about truth separate from the human world; if you try, your life gets farther and farther away from everyday living and eventually you become crazy.

On the other hand, if you ignore the ultimate principle and concentrate on everyday living, your life becomes very cold, without meaning. Very shallow. You can make a lot of fancy noises and make your life very exciting, but it is very shallow. You will feel an uneasiness at the bottom of your life. Even though apparently you are very happy and leading a very fancy life, at the very bottom there will be a definite uneasiness.

So you need thusness and thisness, principle and practice, truth and the phenomenal world; both working in harmony.

This is dharma.

<p align="center">* * *</p>

Dharma is the object of belief for Buddhists. It is not an object of analysis, or philosophical or psychological discussion; it is something to realize through your life. A person who makes the dharma real, manifests the dharma through their life, is called a buddha.

A patriarch is a descendant, one who has received the teachings of a buddha. So each of us is a patriarch. And if you are a patriarch, and you become qualified to teach future generations, then you become a buddha. A buddha understands how important his life is and also lets other people realize how important their lives are, by transmitting the teaching to the next generation.

If you are not a buddha, you cannot teach. If you receive the teaching of a buddha, then you are a patriarch. If you become able to transmit Buddha’s teaching to the next generation, then you become buddha. Such buddha-patriarchs are bestowed with the perfect harmony of truth and phenomenal world. Principle and practice. They understand the world very deeply, with more than just a scientific understanding. And they practice this understanding through their lives, so that principle and practice becomes one.

And then they intimately communicate.

Intimately: A state of uncoveredness. The dharma is with you so closely that you cannot create a gap between the phenomenal world and the truth, you cannot separate them to even the slightest degree. If you have very intimate communication, it’s very difficult to separate the two parties, to make a space between them. Oh, intellectually you can do so, you can say that this is one and that is the other. But actually the relationship is beyond this and that, one and the other, good and bad. There is no boundary. This kind of intimacy is very important in Buddhism, especially in Zen Buddhism.

To communicate or transmit: Although we are already buddha, we must be led to attain the buddha by someone who has already attained; the way to attain must be taught and we must follow that teaching.

Otherwise, although we are buddha, we will fail to manifest the buddha.

If you want your life to work perfectly and peacefully, you have to understand yourself and others and all sentient beings, the visible and the invisble, and you have to accept. Whether you like something or you don’t like it, intellectually or emotionally, you have to completely accept it.

This is not only true of your life, it is also true of other’s lives as well.

So then what is your life?

Your life is the entire whole world. Dogen Zenji said: the self is the entire whole world, which is one bright pearl. This is what I mean when I say you are buddha: that you are the entire whole world, which is one bright pearl. Same is true of your book, even the smallest pebble. It is its entire whole world, because there is nothing to compare it to, no way to discriminate between it and something else.

But if you are already buddha, why must you practice?

In order to manifest your buddha, to make it alive in your life, to attain the buddha way.

It is like a golden statue of Buddha. Every part of the statue, nose, ears, everything, is exactly gold. But it is not Buddha until the gold has been poured into a mold, so that the nose in the gold becomes a nose, and the ears in the gold become ears. Then the Buddha is manifested, realized, and made alive.

How do we do this?

Under the guidance of a person who has realized buddha. A teacher. And if you practice under the guidance of the teacher as buddha, you become exactly buddha, just as this teacher who has attained.

At that time teacher will intimately communicate the dharma of nyoze. And you will intimately receive it. And then you must completely follow it, practice it, and make it alive in your life. That means you must put yourself in the same way of life as the person who has attained the buddha.

It is just like learning calligraphy. If you want to learn calligraphy under a teacher, you are first taught to write using a textbook. First you receive and accept the textbook, because it is part of the teaching of your teacher. Then the teacher tells you exactly how to hold the brush. Next, you exactly follow the textbook and the the teacher’s way.

Whether you like it or not.

There will be times when you read the teacher’s textbook and observe the teacher’s examples; but when you try to write, your calligraphy will be far from your teacher’s way.

And immediately he will say that he does not like it.

If you refuse to accept this criticism, and refuse to accept the teacher’s way, then you will never master calligraphy to the degree your teacher has. So you must completely follow his way.

This is egolessness. And the practice of egolessness is very hard.

Finally your calligraphy becomes exactly the same as your teacher’s. And then you must go beyond your teacher, and cause your own style of calligraphy to bloom and grow. Unless you go beyond, your calligraphy will always be nothing but an imitation of the teacher’s style.

Do you understand?

People always are saying “my way,” I want to create “my way” of life.

Well, that’s fine. But without perfectly following the teacher’s way and becoming one with that way, you cannot really create your life.

You have to practice for many, many years. You have to mold yourself, like the golden Buddha statue, in the way of life demonstrated by your teacher. In order to manifest your buddha.

Do you know how to attain the buddha?

No, you don’t. But your teacher knows. Buddhas know. So that’s why you have to follow his teaching.

I am told that in Japan, when thread is dyed in the traditional manner, the white thread is dipped into the dye and then pressed and dried, over and over again. When you dip it first into the dye it looks as if it were fully colored, but when you press it, the color seems to leave it. But not all; a little bit is left.
Then you dip it again and press it again and finally after many times, the thread is dyed through and through. And then no matter what kind of cloth you weave it into, no matter how badly it is worn or damaged, the color is always there.

Same is true of buddha nature. It is like the color of the thread, or the gold of the golden Buddha statue. But you must mold it, or weave it into cloth before it is manifest. So you practice again and again, until you become exactly the same as your teacher, exactly the same as a buddha.

<p align="center">* * *</p>

I went to Japan to visit Narazaki Roshi, who is the abbot of a monastery called Zuioji. His brother is also at that monastery. Both of them had practiced for many years under the famous Zen master Hashimoto Roshi, whom I knew very well.

After I had stayed at Zuioji for a little while I was surprised to notice that the abbot’s behavior was exactly the same as Hashimoto Roshi’s. Walking style, talking style, voice, calligraphy: exactly the same.

But he is not Hashimoto Roshi, he is Narazaki Roshi. He is himself, but his way has become that of his teacher. Now his life is really blooming. And everybody respects him, because he has attained Hashimoto Roshi’s way. They are not respecting Hashimoto Roshi, they are respecting Narazaki Roshi.

<p align="center">* * *</p>

If you want to learn the tea ceremony you have to practice again and again exactly as the teacher tells you; your behavior, your attitude, your understanding must be exactly the same as that of you teacher. Finally, the teacher knows the time or opportunity when he or she has to transmit the real teaching of the ceremony.
At that time, the teacher transmits the secret key point of how to deal with the tea ceremony.

We call that the dharma transmission.

The perfect harmony is transmitted from one to another, from me to you. But perfect harmony is not something I give; you are already perfect harmony. You yourself are already the perfect harmonious working of the whole world. You already have this, but you don’t know how to manifest it; this is why we have to practice. And then when the time is right and the conditions arranged, the perfect harmonious working of the whole world is manifested.

This is the dharma transmission.

So Tozan tells us “now you have it.” That means you have it at this very instant; but you must manifest it. And then he tells us, “keep it well.” Keep it well; take good care of it.
Manifest the perfect harmony in your life under the guidance of a buddha, keep it, preserve it by receiving it and transmitting it to others.

Do not give up to despair or self-neglect.

Or destroy the indescribable, distinctive, peculiar flavor of your life.

This peculiar flavor is called the Dharmakaya buddha, or the dharma body. It is the same as the ultimate principle; it is what I refer to when I say you are already buddha.

That is the seed. Everyone’s body and mind are the seed. Everyone has the seed and everyone deserves to let it grow, and blossom, and bear fruit. The fruit is called the Sambhogakaya buddha.

Samboghakaya buddha is something between Dharmakaya buddha and what is called Nirmanakaya buddha, which is the physical world we can sense.

So if you have this seed, where can it grow?

In an appropriate place. And that is your body. Your body and your mind and your whole circumstance: sunsets, sunrises, warmth, cold, everything visible and invisible. That is Nirmanakaya buddha.

And then your seed grows, in peace and harmony, interconnected, interpenetrated with all sentient beings. That is the dharma of perfect harmony of truth and phenomenal world.

If you put the seed in an inappropriate place then the seed doesn’t grow. So you have to put the seed in an appropriate place, one where there is harmony between the truth and the phenomenal world. And then the seed will grow and bear fruit: Samboghokaya buddha, something between the seed of Dharmakaya buddha and the circumstance of Nirmanakaya buddha. Warmth, cold, everything works together and contributes to the growing of the seed into fruit.

And that fruit will have its own peculiar, incredible, indescribable flavor.

Pumpkins, bananas, apples, oranges: every fruit has its own particular, peculiar flavor.

You cannot describe it in words.

Each individual orange has a different flavor, according to the place in which it grew, the sunrises, the sunsets, the different warmth of the sun; all different.

You know, it is very convenient for us to have vegetables during the winter, so we grow them in the greenhouse. But those vegetables are not so delicious; a vegetable has to go through severe winter, very hot summer, spring and autumn. And when it grows that way, naturally, then it has incredible, indescribable, peculiar flavor.

So regardless of whether you like your circumstances or not, try to keep it well. And also your circumstances, your bodies, your minds are constantly changing. So you have to learn how to keep it well.

This is our practice.

This is why in one of the precepts it states: no killing.

Bodhidharma explained it this way: in accordance with refraining from taking life, a buddha seed grows to achieve continuity of the Buddha’s wisdom.

To achieve continuity of the Buddha’s wisdom means to achieve continuity of keeping the perfect harmony of the whole universe, truth and phenomena. If we kill we break that continuity; and so we should refrain from taking life.

In any event, regardless of whether you know it or not, you have already been taught by Buddha. This is why we say you are buddha. You know, even if just intellectually, that you are buddha. This is why Tozan tells you that you have it at this very moment, and urges you to keep it well.

> Filling a silver bowl with snow,  
> Hiding a heron in moonlight --  
> When you array them, they’re not the same;  
> When you mix them, you know where they are.  

#### Commentary: 

How can you keep it well?

Tozan says: “Filling a silver bowl with snow.”

Snow is each of us. Silver bowl is Buddha, your teacher, Buddha’s teachings.

So you should put yourself in the silver bowl, Buddha’s bowl.
Silver and snow are the same color, but they are different. So when you put yourself in the Buddha’s bowl, there is no gap between you and it. You are buddha, and Buddha is buddha. That is how to keep it well.

If you try to always judge yourself in terms of your own understanding and your own feelings, then it is difficult to put yourself in the silver bowl, because you feel so conspicuous, there in the Buddha bowl.

At that time you are not keeping it well.

Keep it well means to let the seed of the buddha nature grow. And to do this you must continually put yourself in the Buddha bowl. That is what is meant by the practice of egolessness: to put snow in a silver bowl.

That’s why Tozan tells us at the end of this sutra: Practice secretly, working within, as though a fool, like an idiot -- if you can achieve continuity, this is called the host within the host.

This is the best way.

You become host within the host, in whatever situation you may be in. You become the host, but you become something more than the host, because you can create your own life. So it is not the practice of imitation. That is what is meant by filling a silver bowl with snow, hiding a heron in moonlight.

Dogen Zenji wrote:

> A snowy heron on the snow field  
> Where winter grass is unseen  
> Hides itself in its own figure.  

This is our practice.

Filling a silver bowl with snow, hiding a heron in moonlight.

Put yourself in the silver bowl, put yourself in a certain pattern of the Buddha way of life. This does not mean that you should be hidden behind the Buddha’s way of life, or that you should imitate. It means that your practice should be like the snowy heron, that hides itself in its own figure. You are already white like the snow, which means that you are already buddha nature. When you put yourself in the silver bowl, then there is growth. But it doesn’t show conspicously; it is difficult to distinguish, like the difference between snow and silver.

That is why Tozan goes on to say: When you array them, they’re not the same; when you mix them, you know where they are.

A heron has long legs, a chicken has very short legs. Katagiri is short man and Don here is very tall man. So there is a difference. But the difference doesn’t matter. Snowy heron is a heron, snow is snow. The difference is there, but it is not fundamental.

When you mix them you know where they are. “Mix” is not really the word; they do not mix like paint. When you see them together you know which is which.

You are you, Buddha bowl is Buddha bowl, silver is silver. There is a difference. When you throw yourself into the Buddha way and practice it, it’s not mixed up. It’s not a combination. It’s not fused. You are you, Buddha is Buddha.

If we lose sight of this then very naturally we feel that practice means losing our own particular life-style and personality. It’s not like that at all. Buddhist training is not like Army training, or brainwashing. The heron still has its own figure.

#### Text: 

> The meaning is not in the words,  
> Yet it responds to the inquiring impulse.  

#### Commentary: 

“Meaning” here refers to the real dharma, something behind the song; the real meaning. So the dharma which has been transmitted is more than words. Yet it responds to the inquiring impulse --if you look for it you can find it. There is an interacting communication, a communion, between the snow and the silver bowl, the snowy heron and the snowy world. And that communion is completely beyond words and language.

There is a very famous story of Rinzai, or Lin Chi in Chinese, told in the Record of Lin Chi. Rinzai said: “The true man without rank is going and coming through your nose and eyes and ears; if you don’t know this yet, look.” A monk came up to him and said, what is the true man without rank? Rinzai immediately grasped the monk and shook him, saying “Speak! Speak!”

This means that buddha nature, true man, True Self, is not something a Zen Master gives or a monk receives. True man is already in everybody, manifesting perfect harmony of whole universe.

You are whole universe, and you are perfect harmony; that’s why you are alive.

Perfect harmony with what? Whole universe, including truth; all things visible and invisble. The whole universe comes together and harmonizes in your life. Supports your life. This is called the true man.

And then Rinzai got up from his seat and grasped the monk and shook him, saying “Speak! Speak!”

“Speak!” means here you are; here buddha is.

And then the monk said “Oh! Oh!”

He was too rattled to speak, and he completely lost the chance to say something; all he could say was “Oh!”

“Oh!” means “Oh! I am buddha;” means he realized, “Oh! I am buddha.” Completely beyond the word. Rinzai said “Speak!” and the monk realized, “Oh!” And he accepted himself as buddha.

It is like when you see the beautiful flower. At that moment you cannot say anything; just “Wow!, “ that’s all. It is beautiful beyond all words. So you just accept.

Wow.

When you say “Wow!, “ you completely accept the whole world.

And then after the monk said “Oh!,” Rinzai pushed him away and left.

This gesture meant that just accepting is not good enough. We say, don’t stay on the chair of the Buddha. This means you have to go beyond realization, you have to live. You cannot stay on the chair of just saying “Oh!”

Do you understand this?

Even though you realize how beautiful the human world is, you cannot spend every day saying “Wow! Beautiful! Beautiful!,” or your life will be completely up in the air.

For morning will come and you will have to get up. Evening will come and you will have to go to sleep.
You cannot just say “Wow!” Right in the middle of the “Wow!” you have to go beyond this and make it alive in your life.

Which is why Rinzai pushed the monk away and left.

This is the great teaching given by Rinzai, a teaching completely beyond words. You can read it in the Record of Lin Chi, Number Three.

> If you’re excited, it becomes a pitfall;  
> If you miss it you fall into retrospective hesitation.  

#### Commentary: 

If you say “I attained enlightenment,” then immediately you fall into the pitfall. Or if you say “I am a good boy, “ you fall into the pitfall. Because when you say “I” understand “it” you have fallen into the pitfall of dualism, and you lack understanding of the self. You ignore the unity of subject and object. And then, excited or not excited, you are in the pitfall.

But if you miss it, miss the important point of life, then you fall into retrospective hesitation. You don’t know which way to go. The way to go is very clear every day, but if you miss the important point of life, you are paralyzed by hesitation.

If you are completely dragged away by your thoughts, by like or dislike, then you hesitate and you cannot get into the depth of the Buddha way.

But if you understand the most important point, and you treat it as something outside yourself, some kind of stimulus, then you become excited and you make your own pitfall. And you cannot move an inch there.

So if you truly realize this most important point, the perfect harmony of your life interconnected, interpenetrated with the lives of all sentient beings, then you can make it alive. Beyond words, beyond excitement or non-excitement, despair or negation or self-affirmation. You can make your life truly alive. And that is how you keep it well. Nothing but the achievement of continuity of just quiet practice. It is quiet, but it is active; very active.

#### Text: 

> Turning away and touching are both wrong,  
> For it is like a mass of fire.  

#### Commentary: 

“It” is the teaching of thusness, the dharma of nyoze mentioned in the first line of the song: truth and phenomena and teaching, the perfect harmony of principle and practice. If you want to teach human life you have to teach the perfect harmony of truth and phenomena, theory and practice, equality and distinction. If you teach them separately it won’t work; you have to digest through and through theory and practice, equality and distinction. Then you can teach.

The perfect harmony will manifest itself in your personality, and you will become buddha, spreading grace to people in all circumstances.

But this perfect harmony is like a mass of fire: if you touch it you will be burned up and if you ignore it you will be frozen.

If you ignore the phenomenal world and attach to the truth, then you become spaced out.

Floating.

Your life is up in the air and you become crazy. In the good sense you experience ecstasy, religious fascination; but I’m not sure whether that is good for you or not.

Or you don’t know what to do about the truth and the phenomenal world, and you become very confused, and your head hurts, and you don’t know what to do. So you burn out. You say, “I can’t take all this complicated stuff, “ and you ignore the truth.

At that time your life doesn’t work very well either. Oh, you can have a pretty good career in some specialized field, but I think you life will be very cold; your mind will be very cold, and finally you will be isolated from people and society and you will be very alone.

So turning away and touching are both wrong.

And it is a mass of fire. Your life is just like a fire; not a small fire, an individual fire, but a huge mass of fire: eternal, innumerable, boundless; more than you can measure by any mental process. Living, vivid, energies, constantly coming. Wherever you go, you have to know it, understand what it is. For your life is constantly supported by this mass of fire, this perfect harmony of truth and phenomena, distinction and equality.

Some of you strongly support equality for women. Well, women are women; you should know the distinction between women and men. You cannot combine them, or say that they are exactly the same; equality doesn’t mean combination. What you should realize is the perfect harmony with women. You should know who you are, interconnected, interpenetrated, with men and women, trees, birds and the whole human world. And then you can stress equality for women, and it will work pretty well. Because you respect the distinction between men and women you can then respect the equality between men and women.

To take care of your life is to burn your life’s energies, wherever you may go. In the realm of science, in the realm of literature, sports, whatever; every moment you have to burn your life’s energies. And when you do that you are doing something that is completely beyond our ability to describe in language.

We use the technical term “dharma” to describe this energy, this perfect harmony, but no matter how you explain something technically you will always fail. Because theory is exactly practice. They are not separate. And practice is exactly theory. So if you don’t study, your head becomes very soft. And you just do what you like, become like an animal, or a bird. But that practice doesn’t last very long for human beings. So practice must be exactly one with theory.

### Part 2

#### Text:

> Just to depict it in literary form  
> Is to relegate it to defilement.  

#### Commentary: 

Let me explain this stanza very simply: If you describe the perfect harmony of theory and practice, distinction and equality, that description will be false. It will miss the bullseye. The bullseye is perfect harmony itself. You can come close in a description, but you will never hit the bullseye.

But literary form cannot be ignored. Even though it doesn’t hit the bullseye, you have to understand the word and the explanation of truth in the word.

Which is why Zen has lots of scriptures. And there is a basic Zen philosophy, called the “Five Ranks,” which describes five degrees of realization. It is a philosophy of how distinction and equality are harmonized from moment to moment.

The First Rank is “the relative within the absolute.” “Relative” can be thought of as practice or distinction, and “absolute” as theory or equality.

Second, “the absolute within the relative.”

Third, “the coming within the absolute.”

Fourth, “the arrival within the relative.”

Fifth, “the attained within integration.”

You need to study and understand these, because in the Zen teachings you will often encounter complicated and paradoxical expressions.

For example, if you read the Fukan Zazen-gi, the Universal Recommendation for Zazen by Dogen Zenji, you will come across the following: “Think of nonthinking...This in itself is the essential art of zazen.”

You cannot understand this statement intellectually, but our daily life is just like that. That’s why Dogen Zenji says: “This in itself is the essential art of zazen.”

The essential art of your life. The essential art of the tree’s life, or the bird’s life, and so on.

“Think of nonthinking” means that “not to have a thought” implies
“to have a thought.” So in that sense thinking lies within not thinking.

For example, children imply parents, because there cannot be a child without a set of parents. So, parents lie within children.

Then in Zen we say, “parents are children.” It doesn’t make sense intellectually, but it is actually the truth.

So think of nonthinking means that the idea of not thinking immediately brings on thinking.

That’s why, if you do zazen, I say “Don’t think.”

If you try not to think, that trying not to think is already giving rise to thought. So finally you say, “How can I stop?”

Just stop.

But you don’t understand either thought or non-thought.

When I say “Don’t think,” then that implies thought, because you are already trying to form an idea of nonthinking.

Which is why I say: “Don’t think!” And then immediately you say
“Yes Sir!,” and try. As soon as you try not to think, you create thoughts. Always.

That’s why, within the framework of thinking, to think of nonthinking means thought and non-thought are the same.

Zen always says I am you, you are I.

Trees are me. Buddha is the oak tree. It doesn’t make sense, but it’s really true.

If you really think very deeply, what’s going on in your life is a perfect harmony of distinction and equality.

You can know this. Even though you don’t understand the meaning of thinking or not thinking, you can sit.

Try.

Sit.

Very clearly thoughts appear as they are, and absence of thought appears as clear as possible.

But beyond those you are just there.

Not only in Zen we can say “I think therefore I am,” after Descartes. It is really true. You are thinking, that is why you exist.

Who exists?

You try to ignore, or destroy, or neglect your thoughts, and already you are thinking. But there is still something left, completely beyond your ideas of thinking or not thinking.

What is left?

You.

That you is “I think therefore I am.”

That is the pure sense of self.

Zazen itself.

I am sitting, that’s why I sit.

Why do you want to do zazen? Because zazen is here. I am here, that’s why I do zazen. That’s all!

It’s very simple actually, but we don’t understand, and so Zen has to explain through words like these.

For example, in your daily life you use the words “bread and butter.” That is two words. But they are not two: if you say bread, bread implies butter. Bread lies within butter. Bread is butter.

But if I say “Bread is butter,” you say “What? What did he say?” You don’t understand, but it is exactly so.

Why?

You use these terms as single words. “Bread” and “butter.” If you say “Bread and butter is Katagiri,” it would be wrong grammatically.

That means it doesn’t make sense intellectually.

But actually you use bread and butter as one: “Breadandbutter.”

So the way you use bread and butter is not according to theory of language, but you use it anyway. As one.

Dogen Zenji goes on to say: “How do you think of nonthinking?”

Not thinking is thinking.

Bread is butter.

What could we possibly mean? How do you think of bread in butter?

You cannot understand it rationally.

It is completely unthinkable. But we must think of “bread is butter” because that is the way we use bread and butter.

It is unthinkable but we use it that way, so we have to think it.

<p align="center"> * * * </p>

Someone says, “Katagiri is a good fellow.” Now you don’t know Katagiri, so you say, “What do you mean?” If you don’t know me, then it’s unthinkable.

But Katagiri is a good fellow anyway, so we can just sit here and talk. That is a fact, even though you may not understand it intellectually, even though it is unthinkable. So you have to think the unthinkable.

Therefore the unthinkable is thinkable.

This means that the notion of unthinkable is entirely free from its self-conception. When you say “bread,” immediately you attach to the notion of bread. But bread itself is originally free from any notion of “bread.” Because bread is butter. Intellectually, it is unthinkable, but in actuality bread is butter. Because you use bread and butter as one.

Non-thought exists, but in order to experience it you have to think it. There is the thinkable.

Technically, this is called “datsuraku,” or falling off. Dropping off. Sometimes we say enlightenment, but that has a little different meaning; here we mean just dropping off or falling off.

It is not something you cause to happen. You cannot make bread drop the concept of bread. No. Bread is bread itself. The term “bread” drops off its own self-concept.

Intellectually you don’t understand the unthinkable but it is here. Both bread and butter are perfectly unified, working together.

Then what is it that makes them work in perfect harmony, in perfect peace?

That is something thinkable. Even though it seems unthinkable, you have to think about it, because it exists, right here, right in front of you.

For example, peace and war. You cannot always concentrate on peace and ignore war. On the other hand, you cannot always concentrate on war. Right in the middle of war there is peace. It is unthinkable, but right in the middle of war there is somebody, some person who preserves and maintains peace. So, peace is war.

So, you have to think the unthinkable, realize this perfect harmony.

Peace itself is originally free from any self-concept. It is just peace. So if you concentrate on peace alone, no matter for how long, you cannot achieve it.

This is the meaning of the term datsuraku, dropping off.

Bread itself is free from any concept of self. That’s why bread becomes butter. Very naturally. Butter itself is free from its concept of self.

That is freedom; essential freedom.

Katagiri is Japanese. But “Japanese” is itself free from self-concept, so Japanese are Americans.

What’s the difference?

Katagiri is you. I can shake your hand.

Non-thought is free from any self-concept; thought is free from self-concept. Table, microphone, all of them: all free. So microphone is in the state of dropping off; in other words, freedom.

Katagiri is freedom.

In other words, dropping off means that unthinkable or bread or butter don’t hold fast to any concept of themselves.

Bread doesn’t hold fast to its belief or its notion of itself. Butter doesn’t hold fast to its belief or its notion. So very naturally bread and butter are free, drop off themselves.

Anger has great power to free itself from itself. That’s why if you are full of anger, you should please sit down. And then you will say, “I see more strong passion than anger.”

This is fairly difficult in everyday life. That is why zazen is good; sit down there and anger drops off. By its own power.

That is what we call freedom.

So then what is anger? What is love?

Is love wonderful?

Well, yes; and then again, no. Because real love is not love opposed to hatred; love itself is complete freedom.

Sometimes love moves to hatred. Then love is hatred. This is very natural, because love is not love by itself; love is hatred. Hatred is love. Sometimes I see couples who are always fighting. That fighting with hatred turns into love. So love and hatred don’t hold fast to their own self-concepts.

That is called dropping off.

Freedom. The unthinkable.

It means that the unthinkable has its own motive which lets it move to become thinkable.

So love itself doesn’t hold fast to its own self-concept; this means love starts to move to hatred.

Because the microphone is free from it’s own self-concept, it moves toward you or me or anybody. It can used by anybody, for anything.

So everything is freedom.

In other words, dropping off.

Hatred, prejudice, pain: all freedom. They have great power to become free from themselves. By their power, which we call [...]

So everything has a certain motive, certain fresh and vivid energies. Hatred has fresh and vivid energy to be free from itself. If you don’t fight with it, then it becomes calm very naturally. But if you fight it, it becomes bigger, because it depends on you to make it big or make it small, or make it become still. If you let it become quiet or still, it will become quiet. So very naturally hatred itself drops off by its own power.

This is zazen. And it is pretty good for us.

Then the practical question is, how do we come to understand the fresh and living energy which is present in everything?

By the practice of no arrogance. Selflessness. Egolessness.

Through the practice of egolessness you can realize how everything has its own fresh and vivid energy. If you become selfless, you can get that energy. As soon as you sit down in zazen, you have begun the practice of egolessness.

Sometime, when you are sitting, you will receive this big energy.
Because if you become egoless, very naturally this fresh and vivid energy will come up. Just like the water from a spring.

That is a pretty good realization.

Then people become surprised and confused, and don’t know what to do. But it is not necessary to be concerned about it. It is a very natural situation. As Dogen Zenji says, forget the self. Or as this sutra ends: “As though a fool, like an idiot.” The words are different, but the meaning is the same. So remember that everything has these fresh and vivid energies.

How do we learn this?

Through the practice of no arrogance; egolessness; forgetting the self. At that time everything will come up to you.

In other words you should deal with your pen, and water, and vegetable with wholeheartedness.

And then vegetable will come to you. But you cannot make it happen. Vegetable has its own fresh and vivid energies. So it can help your life. And the arrival within the relative means you can move toward the vegetable; and then the vegetable will come to you.

That is the interacting communion between you and the vegetable; between all things.

<p align="center"> * * * </p>

The first rank is the relative within the absolute. Everthing you see is not merely relative; it is something more. It has a very deep meaning. Even something as insignificant as toilet paper has a life full of deep meaning. So you should not use it carelessly. Because of the relative within the absolute; the toilet paper comes from somthing else. Your intellectual sense won’t let you think of it in that way, but that is the way it really is.

There actually is a perfect harmony between your life and the life of the toilet paper; its life can help your life. So there is something thinkable there; and you should think it. That toilet paper comes from the effort of myriad people. It is a very small thing, but it is deeply interconnected with the lives of all sentient beings.

And you can practice egolessness, even in the use of this little piece of toilet paper. In the Zen monastery we gassho, see the toilet paper, and take just one or two pieces. Not three or four, recklessly.

This is egolessness.

Egolessness does not mean to reduce your individuality. If I said that you wouldn’t believe me, because you always want to express your identity and exercise your power. Show how wonderful you are.

So always you come first.

But I say, forget yourself; put yourself in the place of the toilet paper. You may think that this means to reduce your individuality, but that is not so. It’s really the practice of egolessness.

And if you practice egolessness then very naturally the toilet paper moves toward you and helps your life. You move toward that deep life of the toilet paper and the toilet paper comes up to you and helps. That is the relative within the absolute.

<p align="center"> * * * </p>

The second rank is the absolute within the relative. This means that you cannot deal with the absolute alone, separate from the relative. If you want to explain the absolute you must do so in terms of the relative, in terms of the human world.

Now each thing in the relative has its own freedom. It can drop off its self-concept by itself. It can show very deep meaning.

<p align="center"> * * * </p>

Then there is the third rank, the coming from within the absolute. Everything comes from the absolute. It is a huge world, one you cannot measure by any mental process. But you can experience it. Just move toward vegetable, or toilet paper with wholeheartedness. Wholeheartedness means to manifest your own fresh and vivid energies, which makes your life move toward your object in the pure sense.

So the first step is to jump into it, with true heart and sincerity. And then, in the process of jumping in with true heart you can learn what it is.

Love, hatred, whatever.

You have to learn about the real world. As a practical matter you must move toward the third rank. Because you have understood the first and the second, and you know how deep, how profound everything is. Then as a practical matter you should face everything with attentiveness, kindness, and compassion. That is the coming from within the absolute.

<p align="center"> * * * </p>

And then there occurs the arrival within the relative. The toilet paper comes up to you and helps. So nothing is wasted. Even hatred and pain disappear and we learn the depth of human life. That is our arrival.

So then you truly know how to take care of pen, and water, vegetable and toilet paper. You know how to take care of your life. That is the arrival within the relative.

<p align="center"> * * * </p>

Finally, there is the fifth rank: the attained within the integration.

This is called oneness.

It is a kind of identity action. You and I work together completely, absolutely. Perfect harmony exists.

Regardless of whether we understand or not, perfect harmony will constantly exist. In you, in me, in the relationship between you and me. Wherever we may go.

If your practice proceeds through the first four ranks, then very naturally you will learn the true meaning of things like love and hatred.

In the process of sharing your life with other people you will touch the core of love, touch what love really is.

At that time you can be exactly one with the other person. That is identity action.

If you share your life with someone, then in that process you will discover the real meaning of love and hatred, pleasure and pain; the real meaning of life. Otherwise all you understand is the notion, or the concept of love. The notion of hatred. The notion of pain.

Most people are carried away by these notions. If you sit down in zazen and your legs hurt, then you experience pain. And you say that it’s real.

But I don’t think so.

If you believe it’s real then you fight it. And it gets worse.

That sensation that you feel is not the real pain. The real pain is something that you should just let be. And very naturally, sooner or later, it drops off by itself.

I don’t mean you should injure yourself, or commit suicide. Sometimes you have to take care of the pain. But this does not mean you have to create a hatred, or passion toward pain. Just take care of it.

That is called identity action.

For example, you are an adult and you want to play with a child.
To play with a child you must practice egolessness. Forget who you are. Jump into the child’s world. Then you can play.

It is just like a mother, making funny faces and talking to her baby. On the street, or in a car. Her baby doesn’t understand, but it talks back. That indicates that the mother is practicing no arrogance. Forgetting herself, jumping completely into baby’s world, no matter where she may be.

But if you create a gap you cannot play with a baby in this way.
You cannot talk or make funny faces because you are paying attention to the people around you, and worrying about what they think. But a mother can completely forget herself, and jump in. That’s why she can play so well with her baby.

That is the first point about identity action. The second point is that you cannot forget your position. A mother forgets herself, but she doesn’t forget her role as a mother. So if the baby wets itself or soils somebody else’s dress then she has to say she is sorry and take care of it. Because she is the mother, not the baby.

You have to practice no arrogance and jump into baby’s life but still you are you. You should maintain your role; when you have to attend to your duty you have to attend to your duty. You cannot confuse yourself with the baby.

For example, you can say equally: “Katagiri is teacher” and “Katagiri is good friend.” The Buddha said this many times: “Teacher is good friend.” But you should not think that this means that the Buddha is just a good buddy, with no particular role or position. If you say to your teacher, “Oh, you good buddy,” then you are completely confused.

Because teacher is teacher. Buddha is Buddha. You are you.

You cannot mix them up. First you have to communicate with the Buddha as a friend; then you can really play with the Buddha. So when you have to bow, you should bow.

But Buddha is Buddha, and you are you.

On the one hand you have to completely forget yourself and jump into Buddha’s world. Then you will experience that world. On the other hand so you should keep your position, you should maintain your identity.

So the first point is that you have to go completely beyond the distinction between mother and child. And from the second point you have to go beyond the equality.

And then there is a third point.

Sometimes, when no one is watching, the baby may crawl off to a dangerous place. Or snatch things, like somebody’s hat in a crowd. At that time the mother has to say, “No, don’t do that.”

So first you have to go beyond distinction, second you have to go beyond equality, and third you have to guide.

With compassion, constantly with compassion. To guide means that the baby goes one way and you say, “Don’t, don’t go that way; please go this way.” That’s all.

And then, fourth, you can have warm human communion, human communication, as between baby and mother. Wherever the mother may be, she has the baby constantly in her mind. It becomes very difficult to separate herself from the baby.

The more you practice like this the more difficult it becomes to separate yourself from other people. Even though you may be physically separated, actually you are not separate; you feel always the presence of the baby, or some other person. That is called interacting communion of appeal and response.

There is a huge interacting communion there, beyond specific babies or specific mothers. For it is really possible to take care of a baby as a wonderful buddha. That is the identity action, the fifth rank: the attained with integration.

<p align="center"> * * * </p>

Intellectually we have to understand these Five Ranks, or five degrees of realization. But our practice is just sitting.

Except just sitting is not just sitting. Because if you emphasize just sitting, then you attach to equality. You must make every effort to sit with straight body, and proper posture: this is distinction.

You cannot ignore distinction. But you cannot become obsessed with the right posture, for then you will work so hard you will exhaust yourself.

I don’t know how well you can adjust to it, but you should learn through actual practice. You cannot ignore the distinction between you and zazen. So you should work hard.

And then you can go beyond distinctions like working hard or working easy. At that time you can just sit.

This is equality.

Very naturally you will suffer from difficulties in following your breath. No one really understands breathing in zazen. Many people ask me how they can take care of their breathing in zazen.

Well, I don’t know either. I am still working on it.

So you have to work hard. There is nothing wrong with that. And then at some time equality will manifest itself. It’s pretty nice, just sitting there and following your breath.

That is called *shikan*. And then you will experience interacting communion between yourself and zazen. You guide zazen, and zazen guides you.

So very naturally there is a wonderful communication.

Finally you cannot escape zazen; you really enjoy it, even though you feel pain. The more you do zazen the more you realize that zazen and the more deeply it penetrates your life. It is just like chewing brown rice. When you see brown rice it looks ugly and distasteful, but if you chew it for a long time a wonderful flavor comes up. Zazen is just like that.

#### Text:

> It is bright just at midnight;  
> It doesn’t appear at dawn.  

#### Commentary:

“Bright” in this case is a metaphor for the phenomenal world; when it is bright you can see everything clearly: book, table, and so forth. A world of distinction. And “at midnight” means darkness; but in Zen Buddhism darkness doesn’t mean dark. It means the truth, or ultimate principle. Because in darkness everything becomes equal. So midnight stands for utimate truth, ultimate nature, or theory.

So it is bright just at midnight.

Intellectually it doesn’t make sense, but it is really true, for distinction and equality work together. In peace and harmony.

Then what is distinction?

It is distinction in equality. Working together. Bright just at midnight.

In the The Merging of Difference and Unity, it says: “The spiritual source shines clearly in the light.” “Spiritual source” means the truth. When it is at work in everything then the world becomes bright.

Distinction arises, and you can see table, and people, and microphone. But table, and people, and microphone are in the spiritual source. So there is nothing but the spiritual source. Working together.

On the other hand, it doesn’t appear at dawn. The truth does not appear in front of you, visible to your naked eye. But it’s there.

Equality can be seen in distinction; distinction flows into equality, into the source. In the Merging of Difference and Unity, it says: “The branching streams flow in the darkness.”

All distinctions, all phenomena, flow into the darkness of truth and equality. And equality flows into the world of distinction and phenomena. So phenomena are phenomena, but they are something more.

The mountain you can see is a mountain, but it is something more than the mountain you see. That’s why it is wonderful, and it attracts you. But sometimes it repels you, because it seems too dangerous for you.

So finally you have to go beyond distinction and beyond equality.
Then you can guide. Then you can educate. Then you can take care.

### Part 3

#### Text: 

> It acts as a guide for all beings --  
> Its use removes all pains.

#### Commentary: 

According to the philosophical background of the Soto Zen tradition, truth does not exist by itself, separate from phenomena. And phenomena do not exist separate from the truth.

The same can be said of theory and practice. If you wish to explain theory, that theory must be exactly one with practice. If you practice, your practice must be exactly one with theory. If it is not, it will not last very long.

So theory and practice go together. As one; not as two things in accord. If you say that practice must be in accord with theory, then you are falling into the trap of dualistic thinking. So when you say “theory,” right then there must be practice.

That means that theory must penetrate people’s hearts. At that time theory will become rooted very deeply in the ground of everyday human life. Then when you explain theory it will really help people.

But if you explain theory separate from human life, that theory will just be theory.

Like a dead tree.

Your life will become just that: theoretical. So your theory is not part of your life, and even though you can explain some aspect of this theory, it will just be like a dead tree. Because it won’t connect with your life. And so no matter how much you explain it will fail to help people.

When you explain some aspect of theory, you must devote yourself wholeheartedly to just the explanation. That’s enough. It’s not necessary to think about practice. Because the practice will be there.

So through explanation you can both give the theory and show an example of practice. If you treat them separately you cannot do both simultaneously. But it will be enough if you just present the theory with all your heart.

Because then the two become one. And you will have given both, simultaneously. With no distinction between theory and practice.

Dogen Zenji said: “When one side appears, the other is in darkness.” That means that although the other side doesn’t appear, it is there. Like a sheet of paper. If you use one side, you just have to use that side; the other side is simultaneously there. It is not necessary to point out the other side, for it is one with this side. As a practical matter, all you have, to do is use this side. And the other is already with you.

That is oneness.

That is what Dogen Zenji was referring to.

That is a very important lesson, particularly in Zen Buddhism. It is quite different from the Western teaching of dialectic. Some scholars have written that this teaching is the same as dialectic, but actually it’s quite different.

According to the dialectic you have to recognize opposition and conflict with it. So you practice in the realm of dualism. And you try to destroy the old things and get the new; the new always supplants the old. That is why you cannot stop the constant conflict, why there is no peace.

According to Zen Buddhist teaching, you should completely devote yourself to accepting and using the new. That’s enough. And the old will always be there. So when you practice this way it is not necessary to destroy the old in order to get the new. The old is always with all new things. All you have to do is accept the new and deal with the new with true heart. And the old will be there.

The same applies to theory and practice, good and bad, right and wrong, truth and phenomena. Absolute and relative are one. You cannot separate them at all. You cannot deal with them in a dualistic way, because in practice you cannot do two things at once.

So all you have to do is deal with the relative. At that moment the absolute will be with you.

This teaching fits every aspect of human life: professional life, everyday life, whatever. It fits any situation, and lets you create a peaceful, harmonious world. That is why it acts as a guide for beings. If you understand the teaching and use it you can really remove human pain and suffering.

#### Text: 

> Although it is not fabricated,  
> It is not without speech.  

#### Commentary: 

“Although it is not fabricated” is a reference to the unconditioned world, the absolute. “It is not without speech” means the phenomenal world.

You can explain or manifest yourself, but your life can never be manifested exactly. Because your life is very deep. So you have to understand both the life which you can manifest, and the life which cannot be manifested.

That life is very deep.

Very hard.

Very complicated.

So you cannot manifest or expound it. We call it
“Buddha-nature,” “Supreme Perfection,” “Supreme Bodhi.” Those are just technical terms; the meaning is that your life is very deep. Coming from the beginning of the past, going to the future; endlessly.

That is your life.

And not only human life: trees, birds, everything is like this.

If you look at your life from this point of view, you are nothing but this ordinary being, which happens to have a human body and a human mind through whose six senses you can see and hear and think.

But you cannot grasp the absolute with these senses.

Which is why this sutra begins, “The teaching of thusness has been intimately conveyed by buddhas and patriarchs.”

“The teaching of thusness,” the dharma of nyoze, the relative and absolute working in perfect harmony: this is not something you can grasp directly by your six senses.

But it can be transmitted from patriarch to patriarch; from person to person.

So the dharma is mysterious, because it cannot be grasped by the six senses; but it is not mysterious, because it can be transmitted to the next generation.

Very practically, very clearly.

Now this verse says, “...it is not fabricated.” That is a reference to the unconditioned world. But on the other hand, “...it is not without speech.” So you can transmit it.

Now this is very important, for it means that the human form is not bound and constrained. It is, in fact, liberated; emancipated.

Free.

I can think that the human form is bound and constrained, that Katagiri here is the result of his family and other things. Using ideas like these I can fabricate a kind of conditioned world.

But on the other hand this human form and any ideas I fabricate are characterized by the inherent ability to be free from any such ideas.

Because the phenomenal world is simultaneously interconnected and interpenetrated by the absolute. It is going there, constantly. Human form also. So very naturally I cannot hold on to this form. This is what we call emptiness. Katagiri’s form, all form is emptiness.

When I realize this I see something that I have never seen before. My goodness! This is my life?! How wonderful I am! I see the huge world that we call the absolute.

So this form has great powers to see that this form is not merely this form. That it is something else, because it is connected with the absolute.

So body, mind, ideas are always characterized by their own power to move towards the absolute, to be liberated. And then we can see the wonderful world that we call the absolute. And we try to attach to the absolute but the absolute itself is also emptiness.

So very naturally you cannot hold onto the absolute. But the absolute is always coming into the human form, always interconnected with it. Just like two feet, walking as one.

<p align="center"> * * * </p>

In the Bendowa Dogen Zenji wrote: “The practice of the way makes myriad dharmas exist in realization.” In the huge world, Buddhist world, the practice of the way makes myriad forms exist: tables, our bodies, everything.

Exist where?

Not in the small world where arguments happen, but in realization. In the largest, broadest perspective. A huge world, connected with past, present, and future.

This is called Mu, the unconditioned world. In Zen we say “Your face before your parents’ birth.”

And then Dogen Zenji says: “And practice a total reality by transcending realization.” You cannot always stay with that realization, that so-called absolute or buddha-nature. In order understand the unconditioned world you have to practice.

For instance, if you have some hope, some goal for the future, you must practice that hope every day. That is good practice for us, to take a hope and think carefully and find out a way to realize it. The hope itself is part of the unconditioned world, because you haven’t reached it yet.

But it is alive in your life.

That is what it means to transcend realization. You transcend the hope by practicing here and now. That is what Dogen Zenji meant by practicing the total reality.

At that time you can go over the barrier of the absolute, the barrier of the phenomenal, the barrier of what you think of as “my body.” Then all your bonds drop away, and you are not affected by categories and distinctions, such as the thought of “my body.”

This does not mean you attach to the absolute, the buddha body. The buddha body is there, but you cannot attach to it. You have to transcend it.

How can you manifest the buddha body with your body, in our world?

Practice.

For instance, there are many kinds of gassho. When I teach you a certain gassho, you should listen to it, and accept it, and do gassho in that way. The gassho is done with your human body. It is not the actual buddha body. But with your human body you can manifest the buddha body.

How?

Just accept the instruction of how to gassho, and then do the gassho carefully, wholeheartedly; with true heart.

At that time, the buddha body blooms. The next moment, a thought arises, and you are back in the human body. The moment after that, you keep quiet and then the buddha body arises.

<p align="center"> * * * </p>

Usually we are chasing after our thoughts, and so we just see the human body do gassho. And we think about gassho. We read a book of Mudras and find many kinds of gassho. So we complain to our teacher and refuse to accept the one we have been taught. Or we ask, “What is the meaning of gassho?”

As a result we become completely involved in a world fabricated by human thought.

That’s all right, because you already live in the world fabricated by your thoughts.

But you cannot always play in that world, or you will be completely carried away. And you will not understand the significance of human life. And you will become confused. You may be very practical, but you will be very shallow.

So the important point is that we must do something with this body that is more than just this body. That is the point, always.

For instance, say you are an artist and you wish to carve a statue of the Buddha. You have to use wood, and chisels, and your body. But you also have to use your human body to be something more than human body; to be Buddha body. You must become Buddha before you can really make a Buddha. If you work the wood with nothing but your human body, then the statue will never really be a statue of Buddha. Buddha must become one with you. Then you carve the Buddha, but it is more than just you that is doing the carving.

That is our everyday practice.

So the sutra says “Although it is not fabricated, it is not without speech.”

This is what we call liberation, or emancipation. Everything is liberated. This table before me is liberated. It is not just the table you hold in your thoughts. It is free, emancipated from the limits of your thoughts. The technical term is “Samboghakaya Buddha.” Something between Dharmakaya Buddha, the truth or absolute, and Nirmanakaya Buddha, the world of our perceptions and concepts. Something more than the limited world of our concepts, something emancipated from it.

That freedom really teaches people. If you are not emancipated, liberated in your actions and your practice, it is very difficult to teach or to help people. We must keep that in mind always in our practice.

<p align="center"> * * * </p>

There was a very famous Zen teacher, Ishtano Zenji [?], who was Abbot of the Eihei-ji monastery in Japan. He had a very wonderful practice, always manifesting that liberated human mind and human body, wherever he may have been.

One day, he had to perform a Buddhist service for a particular family. This particular service involved chanting the family’s name before the service. Ishtano [?] chanted, but he chanted the wrong name. The Jisha heard this, went up to the Zenji and murmured in his ear that he had made a mistake and had to chant the name of the right family.

Immediately, the Zenji said: “Shut up! I did it right!” 

And everybody there, monks, priests, and visitors, all of them laughed. Now if I did something like that, everyone would be mad at me. But that Zenji instead created a wonderful moment. No one was mad at him. He made a mistake, but that family appreciated him very much anyway.

Because he always practiced with full concentration on his practice. With a true heart. So that practice built up in his life, in his body, each time he acted in that way. That’s why when the Jisha came and poked his head in this very nice Buddhist practice, the Zenji said, “Shut up!”

That’s really a very interesting example. It shows the Zenji teaching the people about liberation, freedom and Nirvana. Through a living being.

Maybe you have experienced something like this in your daily life. Sometimes you see a truly beautiful person. And then you feel something very wonderful, even if you don’t talk to them.

Have you ever experienced that?

Well, maybe sometime in the future you will. Maybe you will encounter someone like that Zenji; even though you don’t talk to them, no matter what they do, you feel good.

I lived at Eihei-ji Monastery for four years with a hundred and twenty monks. Each one different. A certain monk was not very smart, but when I was with him I felt comfortable. Another monk was very smart, and a very nice man, but when I was with him I didn’t have the same peaceful and comfortable feeling.

So there is something there. A difference you can detect, even without the use of language. Even among people as similar as priests and monks there is a difference.

If you practice every day, continually and inconspicuously, just like a child walking, then you will experience these wonderful things. It is what I mean when I tell you to make the roots of your life strong.

That practice is not a showy practice.

It is a very calm practice.

When you do gassho, just do gassho. When the teacher says, “Just do gassho with wholeheartedness,” you say “Yes, Sir!” and just do it. Not showy; not one kind of fancy gesture or another.

When you smile with joy, the whole world becomes joyful. You cannot be mad at anybody. This is the very quiet practice; just do gassho.

And if you continue this practice you can make the root of your life strong, and in everyday life that practice will arise and brighten your life. Which is why this sutra ends with “Practice secretly, working within, as though a fool, like an idiot -- if you can achieve continuity this is called the host within the host. “

This is the main point. This is the Buddhist practice. Buddhist practice is very calm, stable, and not showy. It is to make the root of your life strong.

So that is emanicipation. The manifestation of the unconditioned world in our daily life. In this world, the phenomenal world. Right here.

How?

You cannot escape having been born. And right in the middle of having been born you have to manifest the unconditioned world. This means your are right in the middle of life but you are not panicked. You are in the middle of panic but you are not panicked. That is what we call the practice of emancipation.

<p align="center"> * * * </p>

Early in his life as a monk, Dogen Zenji asked the question: If everything is buddha nature, why is it that we have to practice?

Everything is buddha. Gold, trees, even the smallest piece of wood is important because it is buddha. You can keep a piece of wood and know that it is buddha. But if you don’t carve it into the form of Buddha, then Buddha doesn’t appear. You have to carve it.

So there is the unconditioned world, or the absolute, which has a very deep life. You can keep it and respect it and know that it is the absolute. But if you want to make a Buddha, you have to carve. You have to manifest the buddha in the phenomenal world.

It is like a radish. You can eat a radish plain, and know that the radish is buddha. But it is much nicer if you use a little soy sauce, and some ginger, and other spices to add to the flavor. So that is the relation between buddha and phenomena.

They are interconnected.

Human body and the entire world of the absolute are interconnected.

You do not understand the entire world of the absolute. You don’t know how your body enters this world. I don’t know either. But you can manifest the absolute.

When you do gassho, just gassho. Make that gassho the entire world. Don’t poke your head into it. If you poke your head into it, then the gassho slips away from the Buddha world. It becomes very shaky and unstable. You miss the chance to make the root of your life strong. But in the gassho there is a practice to make the root of your life strong. Just do the gassho. Then with your body you have manifested the Buddha body.

### Part 4

#### Text:

> It is like facing a jewel mirror;  
> Form and image behold each other --  
> You are not it  
> It actually is you.  

#### Commentary:

The jewel mirror means to be free from the stage of the absolute and free from the stage of phenomena. Phenomena does not hold to a fixed position.

It has the power to move to move to the absolute.

So the absolute and the relative are both characterized by being liberated. That is called the jewel mirror.

If you stand up in front of this particular jewel mirror, form and image will behold each other. At this time you can see yourself and you can see your image. Image here means the absolute; you as form are the phenomenal world.

Human world. Human body.

But simultaneously human body shows its own shadow. The absolute. A deep, big world that you know nothing about.

So form and image are always interconnected, right in front of the jewel mirror. The jewel mirror is Buddha’s world: always there.

So you are not it; it actually is you. The absolute actually is you. You are not buddha nature; if you think so, you cannot ever be a buddha. You are a human being. But buddha nature is at every moment you.

Even though you cannot accept this intellectually, it is so.

Because you live facing the jewel mirror, Buddha’s world. You may not want to, but you are living like this, with form and image always interconnected.

The Zen Master (Tozan) composed a poem that said:

> Blue mountain is the father of the white cloud  
> White cloud is the son of the blue mountain  
> All day the white cloud depends on the blue mountain  
> But the blue mountain does not know that at all.

Blue mountain is father of the white cloud is a metaphor for form is emptiness. The phenomenal is the absolute. The human body is the entire whole world. The human body is Buddha.

White cloud is the son of the blue mountain means that emptiness is form; the absolute is the phenomenal. Buddha nature is Katagiri’s human body. At every moment.

And then the white cloud depends on the blue mountain. I, Katagiri, as a form, depend constantly on the absolute.

But the blue mountain does not know that at all.

We don’t know.

I don’t know how I as a form depend on the absolute.

I don’t know means I really don’t know.

I just accept myself as a form living right in the middle of that interconnection, interpenetration between Buddha’s world and myself. So when I do gassho, Katagiri just stands up here and does gassho. That’s enough. And then the Buddha is exactly there.

So from one point of view I am not the absolute when I practice gassho with my body. But on the other hand, “the absolute is exactly you” means that buddha nature is exactly Katagiri; so the entire world is exactly Katagiri’s human body. That is what is meant by interconnection and interpenetration. Always I depend on the absolute; but I cannot perceive how, because it is always exactly me.

> It is like a babe in the world, 
> In five aspects complete;  
> It does not go nor come,  
> Nor rise nor stand.  
> “Baba Wawa” --  
> Is there anything said or not?  
> Ultimately it does not apprehend anything  
> Because its speech is not yet correct.

#### Commentary:

This metaphor is drawn from the Nirvana Sutra. There the Tathagata is likened to a baby in that he does not rise, stand, come, go, or speak.

The first, he does not rise, means the Tathagata does not give rise to forms of the myriad dharmas. Tathagata does not see this microphone, or tape recorder, or table as forms. Humans see them as forms, and automatically we attach to what we see, even if only intellectually. But the Tathagata does not see the tape recorder as a form. He sees it as Buddha.

Which it is.

And you can see it that way.

Even in small things, you can be liberated from form in your everyday life.

Right in the middle of one part of your practice, for instance a gassho, you have to be liberated from the form of the gassho. If you attach to the form you start to poke your head into the gassho. And then you become more and more attached to that form.

But a buddha doesn’t see the form. This means, if you do gassho, just do gassho. Gassho is Buddha. So a buddha sees gashho as Buddha; gassho is the blooming of the Buddha.

That means simply to accept things.

For instance, you see a handsome man or a beautiful woman. If you are not interested in that person as a form, you can just pass by them; you don’t see them as an object of opposite sex. Without leaving any trace you can just talk to them and then leave.

So you can see an attractive person as a form, but you should really see them as a Buddha. That means you deal with them in the best and simplest way. That is a pretty good practice for us. Just say what you have to say and leave.

That’s why we say in Zen terms, just drink a cup of tea and leave.

But of course we don’t do that. We drink a cup of tea and stay there. Chat. Finally we fight.

That’s very common. My teacher constantly told me that when I finished something I should leave as soon as possible.

But of course I didn’t, because I felt constantly lonely. So I would go back, down to the village, perform a service for a family and then talk with the people. And stay there. My teacher would always say, no way, come back soon.

So that is not to rise: not to see the form of attractive people or your friends, but always to see the Buddha. It is a difficult practice, but we can do it, every day. It is very calm, quiet, strong, stable practice. You must try to do it.

The second aspect, not to stand, means that the Tathagata does not attach to the forms of myriad dharmas. If you see everything as Buddha very naturally you do not attach to the form. That doesn’t mean you ignore the form; you can deal with it very effectively. You can deal with the vegetable not as vegetable, but as Buddha. You can deal with water not as the form of water but as the Buddha. So very naturally you do not attach to the form of the water. And you can deal with the water as best and simply as you can and just wash your face.

The third aspect is not to come. This means that his actions are agitated, but are imperturbable as Mount Sumeru. However people criticize him he is acting with imperturbabilty. His mind, his body, his life is never agitated by failure, or benefit, or criticism.

Zen Master Ichizaki [?] Roshi taught us that the priest’s life is supported by other people. According to his way he would. never ask people for money or food or anything. Never. Even though he was very poor, he would never ask anyone. He just lived. And he told us very often that the priestly life is just like that. “According to my way,” he would say, “I do not ask anything of anybody. Because my life is supported by all sentient beings.” And then finally he would say, “If no one gives me food or anything, all I have to do is just be starved to death. This is my priestly life.”

I was very impressed.

For if one doesn’t ask, If one’s life is supported by other people, then there is no guarantee that anyone will give money, or that they will give enough. So he said, if no one gives any money or food, all I have to do is just be starved to death. That is the priest’s life, he said often, and told us we should remember it. And it is true.

So a Buddha has no agitation or hesitation, even if there is no food or no money.

When I was in college I had very little money. I was not agitated very much, but it was very inconvenient. Very inconvenient. So I thought I should have money, because when I wanted to go someplace to listen to a lecture, I would have to walk. And it would take a long time. And so I felt that it was very inconvenient not to have any money. But a Buddha, a Tathagata would never feel that way.

The fourth aspect, not to go, means that the Tathagata has already attained the great Nirvana. He sees this microphone not as a form, but as Buddha; he does not attach to the microphone, or people, or any form. He just lets them go by, constantly pass by. And he deals with all of them wholeheartedly. So very naturally there is no agitation. Very naturally his life is just going -- as a Buddha. Whatever he does. When he does gassho, Buddha does gassho. When he sleeps, Buddha sleeps. When he walks, Buddha walks. So people are very naturally respectful. That is what is meant by the Tathagata has already attained to the great Nirvana. Nirvana means Buddha. Buddha was born, Buddha is living, Buddha dies. Not just a human body dies.

The fifth aspect, not to speak, is explained this way: the Tathagata speaks of myriad dharmas for all sentient beings but indeed he has nothing to be spoken.

“Nothing to be spoken” means that the Tathagata does not have a specific lesson that he teaches, so-called Buddha’s teaching.
No, he doesn’t. He always gives the teaching according to circumstances, and the characteristics and personalities of the people he is teaching.

For example, if he sees a stingy person he may ask him what is the purpose of keeping all that money. Maybe he will give a sermon which will persuade that stingy person to use his money for someone, or some purpose. On the other hand, if he sees a profligate, he may convince him to save his money. So he does not have a fixed lesson about money. He does not teach that money is good or money is bad. That is what it means for the Tathagata not to speak.

So here “Baba Wawa” means words, lots of words. Whether you use words or do not use words, real reality is beyond explanation or no explanation.

> It is like the six lines of the double split hexagram;  
> The relative and absolute integrate --  
> Piled up, they make three;  
> The complete transformation makes five.  

#### Commentary:

The “double split hexagram” is a diagram from the I Ching, which Tozan used to illustrate the Five Ranks. This diagram was used to illustrate that one entity, so-called table, does not exist alone but is interconnected with all sentient beings.

And not just the table.

People, microphone, this table exists interconnected, interpenetrated with table, people, floor, winter, all sentient beings. This is what it means to be like the six lines of the double split hexagram.

The relative and absolute integrate, piled up they make three, the complete transformation makes five. This can be understood if you consider the following diagram:
	
                     |– relative within the absolute
                     |
                     |– absolute within the relative
    piled up, they   |
    make three       |             |– coming within the absolute
                     |             |
                     |– integrate –|– arrival within the relative
                                   |
    the complete                   |– attained within integration
    transformation
    makes five
	
	
The relative and absolute integrate. The relative means the relative within the absolute. The absolute means the absolute within the relative. Then integrate, which refers to the coming within the absolute, the arrival within the relative, and the attained within integration.

If you pile them up they make three: the three are the relative, the absolute, and integrate. The complete transformation makes five refers to all five of the Five Ranks, the philosophical basis for Soto Zen teaching.

In Japanese the relative is called “hen.” The absolute is called
“sho.”

And we say “sho hen ego.”

“Ego” means that a number of things more than two interpenetrate without losing the significance of their own peculiarity. This translation uses “integrate;” that may be close, but not exactly the same as “ego.”

The relative within the absolute is that which Prajna Paramita states as Form is Emptiness. This means that the things which you perceive through your six senses are not things in themselves. All things in the relative have a depth to their own life; their lives are very deep.

It is called the relative within the absolute because the relative comes from the absolute. And the absolute comes from the relative.

So all things in the relative do not hold strongly to their own form. They are always free from their own form, in order to interpenetrate their own object.

So very naturally, all things interconnect, interpenetrate.

If a mother doesn’t take hold of her own position stongly, and becomes one with here children, then there is a very nice communication between them.

This is the relative within the absolute, because mother herself does not have this strong power to hold her own identity and ignore her children’s life. And so very naturally she moves toward children’s life. And equally naturally, children’s life moves toward mother’s.

The absolute within the relative is what the Prajna Paramita States as Emptiness is Form. The absolute does not exist as an entity separate from the relative, from all things in the human world.

When we chant the “Sandokai” we encounter the words “The branching streams flow in the darkness.” Darkness here means the Truth; the Absolute. And there is the phrase “The spiritual Source shines clearly in the light.” “Spiritual source” means the ultimate source of existence. “Shines clearly in the light” refers to all things in the relative. When this ultimate source shines it becomes all things in the relative which you can clearly see. This table, human beings, trees, birds and the four seasons, all of that. All the branching streams are all things in the relative. They flow in the darkness; their lives have depth. Real depth. So the absolute does not exist alone, but is always connected with the relative.

The third rank is the coming within the absolute. This refers to the great motivation that all things have to move to the depth of existence.

Naturally.

So even if you don’t like religion, even if you aren’t interested in a deep understanding of human life, you still very naturally move toward the depths of human beings.

Even though you don’t study religion, or philosophy, or psychology, or any subject like that.

Still, very naturally, you are drawn toward the depths.

Because each and every thing has this great power to move toward the depths of its existence. That is what is called the coming within the absolute.

Then there is the arrival within the relative. This means that if you try to shake hands with the universe, the universe will shake hands with you.

To shake hands with the universe means to try to understand, to practice, to make every possible effort to approach the truth.

But you must stick out your hand first.

Make every possible effort to gain access to the truth, to the depth of human beings, human life. It is the essence, the ultimate nature of human beings to have this motivation. And then very naturally the universe will respond to you. My advice to you is “Diligence and Practice.” Diligence toward Nirvana. That is our effort, our diligence, our zeal. In the direction of ultimate truth, in the direction of the depth of human beings. Whether you understand or don’t understand, anyway, try.

Finally there is the attained within integration. In the third and fourth ranks you can experience the very deep spirit of human life, interconnected, interpenetrated with all sentient beings. We call that “enlightenment,” or “religious experience,” or “spiritual experience,” or something like that.

But there is still a trace of the experience left behind.

So we have to go beyond, to the fith rank, the attained within integration.

Integration.

That is the final goal of our practice. When you reach the fifth rank your practice becomes very quiet and gentle and also very stable, like a diamond.

But it is very quiet.

Not conspicuous.

Not showy.

Regardless of whether people can see it or not, or whether you can get a reward from the practice or not, your practice just proceeds. At that time it is called Nirvana. It is not Something that you should try to see, or try to get, or try to discuss.

No.

You have to just proceed. Just practice, every day, like this.

That is called Nirvana.

#### Text:

> It is like the taste of the five-flavored herb,  
> Like the diamond thunderbolt.  

#### Commentary:

In Japanese the five-flavored herb is called “chiso,” or “gomisi.” Its fruit has five flavors: the peels and flesh are sweet and sour, the core is hot and bitter, and as a whole the fruit tastes salty. So within the one fruit there are the five kinds of tastes. In the Siddharma Sutra the term used for the same in one taste is “equality.” For example, when the rains fall, all forms of beings receive the rain and grow naturally. So one rain is shared with all sentient beings. The taste of the five-flavored herb indicates of the same in one taste, or equality.

At the same time it means differentiation, or discrimination.
This illustrates that the differentiated world is interconnected, interpenetrated with the world of equality.

So you should find the differentiated world in equality and equality in the differentiated or relative world.

Without the relative world you cannot find equality; equality must be found in the limited world. You cannot find freedom in freedom. You must find freedom in no-freedom.

All sentient beings are exactly one Mind. One Mind means just energies, constantly springing up. And helping all sentient beings. Human beings, trees, birds: this is just one Mind. One vijnana, in Sanskrit. This one Vijnana is the dynamical working of energy, the universal life, helping and supporting all sentient beings.

So we should appreciate it, and receive it, and work with it. If you don’t work with it you will feel yourself being sucked in, and you will feel threatened and scared.

Because this energy is constantly moving, and there is nothing you can hold in your hand. Which is why we call it, philosophically, emptiness.

But it’s working.

If you don’t act, if you don’t have your own spirit or diligence or effort which takes the initiative and moves toward Vijnana, then you feel scared. That universal energy looks to you just like black hole, and you feel that everything is going to be sucked into it.

That is not a good attitude. What we have to do is take the initiative and work. Make your life alive. Then you can receive these energies, just like spring water coming out of the ground.

Do you understand?

If you try to understand it objectively, it becomes just like a huge fire, and it scares you. Because you don’t know what it is. You want to reach out to it, but you don’t want to touch it because it is a huge fire, huge energies. Or like a black hole, where you can’t see what’s going on. So if you approach it Objectively, or intellectually, it will always scare you.
Particularly when you are confronted with some kind of crisis, Some situation where you cannot move an inch. You become really scared.

So every day, even though you don’t understand that huge energy, you should make every possible effort to let it rise up and make your life alive. It is like driving a car; you may not understand everthing about how a car works, but you still have to start it and operate it.

That is very important.

But when most people are confronted with a spiritual crisis, they hesitate. And then it scares them more and more and finally they don’t know what to do.

These energies are what are referred to when it is said that the myriad dharmas are exactly one Mind. This is the One Mind, or Mind Only, according to the the Avatamsaka Sutra.

Mind Only. Really hugh energies; fires.

And then, “Like the diamond thunderbolt.” That is a reference to the Vajra of Vairocana. A Vajra is a scepter, very hard and strong, which smashes everything. It is a symbol for stability, or the spiritual security that is possessed by the One Mind. The energy, which is inherent in the universal life.

In Buddhism, and particularly in Zen Buddhism, there are three kinds of scepters. The first is the “doko,” or single scepter.
It has no points; it is just round and has six or seven rings inside. It represents the Tathagata, or Truth. Then there is a scepter with three prongs, which represents the three sacred teachings according to the Shingon school of Buddhism. These are the teachings by means of body, mind, and mouth.

With body, mind, and mouth you can teach the wonderful Buddhist teachings which we call the Sambhogakaya Buddha. This is Something between the Dharmakaya Buddha, or absolute truth, and the Nirmanakaya Buddha, or human form. You cannot teach just in terms of the human form, and you cannot teach the absolute separate from human form. You must teach them as interconnected, interpenetrated with each other.

Sambhogokaya Buddha means you can teach that, even if you do not speak. That is the Fifth Rank, the attained within integration, the dropping off of body and mind. It is not something intellectual. But if you practice this way you will create a huge effluent world.

And finally there is the five-pointed Vajra. The five points represent the five Buddhas of wisdom. The first is the Viarocana Buddha, who is said to reside in the center of the universe, and takes care of the whole universe. The second is the Akshobya Buddha, who is said to reside in the Eastern part of the universe and who has the great perfect mirror wisdom, attained by reaching the eighth level of consciousness, or Alaya-vijnana. Perfect mirror wisdom means that you know what the ultimate source is, and how it works.

Then there is [Latunisambhaga?] Buddha, who has the wisdom of equality, attained through the seventh consciousness or manas.
Manas means more than the unconcious; it is the source of the human sense of ego, and is connected to the Alaya-vajnana. If you study human life you can see how egoistic we are, under all circumstances: favorable conditions, unfavorable conditions, whatever. When you realize that, when you taste through and through how egoistic and selfish we are, then you can attain the wisdom of equality.

Fourth, there is Amitabha Buddha, who is said to live in the West side of the universe and who has the wisdom of observing human life very subtly, and of giving compassion forever. Fifth, there is Shakyamuni Buddha, who lives in the Northern part of the universe, or the human world, and who has the wisdom of complete achievement.

That is what is represented by the five-pointed Vajra. In this translation it says “like the diamond thunderbolt.” This means that the interconnection, interpenetration of the absolute and the relative is the ultimate principle of the human world; it never changes, like a diamond. But it shows itself swiftly, like a thunderbolt.

### Part 5

#### Text:

> Subtly included within the true,  
> Inquiry and response come up together.  

#### Commentary:

So far the perfect harmony of the absolute and the relative have been described by the five examples which show how the relative and the absolute are interconnected, interpenetrated. How very closely they communicate.

They are not two.

Nothing can exist separate from the absolute. Everything is included, very subtly. It is very difficult to say how they are connected and simultaneously included within each other. But if you keep your eyes open to the real reality, where you live from moment to moment, then that moment is really opened up. It includes the relative within the absolute and the absolute within the relative.

That is why this sutra begins with the “teaching of thusness.”

Nyoze: the Chinese characters for relative and absolute, meaning dharma. And dharma is teaching.

So when we teach we must express this perfect harmony. Teaching is not to say something about the one without showing the other.
When you teach about this microphone you have to do so with all sentient beings. Then you can really teach about the microphone.
If you try to teach about the microphone separate from the rhythm of the universe, well, then you don’t really understand the microphone. Of course you can teach in terms of one aspect of the microphone: physics, biology, some point of view you use for explanation. But you will not be teaching about the microphone as a whole.

We have to teach about the microphone as a whole because it is really alive with us. With us and with all sentient beings. That is the microphone. So you have to teach that point; that is the teaching of thusness.

Then inquiry and response come up together. If you knock constantly on the door, very naturally there is something which will come back as a response. But you have to knock constantly on the door. Practice is to keep your eyes open and ask and knock on the door and reach. You can arrive. You can make something happen and then you can arrive. This is the response and also the inquiry.

If you want to compose a poem about Winter, you have to take the initiative and move toward Winter. And then Winter will respond to you.

Even though you don’t know what the truth is, even though you don’t know what the universal rhythm is, you have to move toward it. Every day. And then the universe will stick out its hand and shake. That’s why you have to inquire, you have to knock on the door for a response. Sometimes the response can be seen, sometimes the response cannot be seen. But you cannot stop it, because everything is interconnected within the absolute. So we never know when or how to get that response. So completely beyond planning and speculation, all you can do is move toward the absolute, which means to knock on the door. And then inquiry and response will come up together.

Inquiry and response is when the Spring comes and the flowers bloom; when Winter comes and the snow falls. When there is a teacher and then there is a disciple. When there is a truth, an absolute which we call the Dharmakaya Buddha, then there must be Something through which it is manifested.

And that is our human body.

So it is through the human body, the human world, that the truth must be manifested. That is inquiry and response. That is the natural rhythm of life.

There are no exceptions; everyone must live like this. Teacher cannot exist alone, separate from student; children cannot exist alone, separate from parents. Parents and children communicate, interpenetrate. And then you can build up a very peaceful world. But if there is even the slightest gap between them, any separation or deviation, then the cold air blows in. And that is the human trouble.

#### Text:

> Communing with the source and communing with the process,  
> It includes integration and includes the road;  

#### Commentary:

We must commune with the source. And if there is an ultimate source of being, there must be a road, a process to manifest it.
The source of being doesn’t exist alone. It exists within the process, because the source is always functioning. That’s why the source is nothing but energies, constantly burning flames. And when the source is functioning, working very dynamically, it creates form. These energies are always springing up, and when they do atoms and particles com together and we have what we call form. If the energy is not there then all the molecules and particles will separate, because they do not have their own power to come together.

So that is the nature of these energies: always moving, without taking any form.

That is called “freedom.”

So our nature is inherently free. And then when something happens, we call that an event. Life is just an event. I use the term “emergent case.” It always happens; many molecules of energies come together and make a form. They are called trees, and birds, and human beings, our thoughts, and also planets and things you have never seen; space, time, and many things.

So to commune with the source and commune with the process you have to understand the source. In order to understand the source you have to understand the human beings which exist right now. You have to understand them through and through. And then you can understand the source or the core of human beings. The human beings which you see through your six senses are not very deep; they are actually quite shallow. Even though you see certain people through your six senses, your understanding of these people is limited.

Real human beings are something more than your understanding.

We have to use this human body which is limited by your understanding and others’ understanding; and use it to manifest something more than your and others’ understanding.

To manifest the source. Something deep.

Regardless of whether you believe or not, you have to practice the gassho every day according to the suggestions of the buddhas and the patriarchs: shikan gassho, shikan sitting, shikan walking, shikan sleep. At that time your practice will let you manifest something more than just an action.

For instance, at one moment there may be two people. One persto has hesitation, or doubt, or loss of vitality; but it is time to Sassho and so he does it. The other person, regardless of whether he likes it or not, follows the suggestions of the Duddhas and patriarchs and he does shikan gassho. With wholeheartedness, from moment to moment.

At that time, for the two of them, gassho is completely different. A gassho is a gassho; no matter who does it, the act is the same. No difference. But within this no-difference there is a different gassho. That is called depth. You are really impressed by this particular gassho, and you cannot explain why.

Even though he was the Abbot of Eiheiji monastery, when Hashimoto Roshi laughed everyone could laugh. There can be a completely different feeling within the same laughing.

For instance, one day I was serving Hashimoto Roshi and a group of senior monks when they were discussing the big ceremony to be held on the 700th anniversary of Dogen Zenji’s death. And they were discussing the big meal that was part of the ceremony: how the kitchen should be managed, how much food we should buy, how many people we should expect, that sort of thing. Hashimoto Roshi started talking about something but it was off the mark; a monk quickly said, “You don’t understand how the kitchen is managed, so you should just keep quiet.” Because of course hashimoto Roshi spent his time doing zazen in the zendo, and teaching and guiding the monks.

Hashimoto Roshi just laughed, with a very deep voice.

But it didn’t disturb anybody; it created a very relaxed and harmonious feeling. And everyone else laughed. Now that comes from a very deep practice. Shikan zazen, shikan gassho, on an everyday basis; very quiet and inconspicuous. To practice inconspicuously is to make the root of your life strong.

So that is communing with the source and simultaneously communing with the process.

If you practice like this very naturally you can commune with the source. That is what we call the depth of gassho, the depth of a smile. An inconcelvable smile comes forth. An inconceivable fragrance comes forth from every action and every pore of human beings.

It includes integration and includes the road. So the human life includes the integration, the real reality of the present moment. Real reality means life as a whole. Your life, interconnected and interpenetrated with all sentient beings. That is called integration, the real reality of your life.

But we don’t see our individual life like that; always we see individual lives and ourselves as individuals, separate from others and all sentient beings. So we never have a chance to see integration, to see the perfect harmony. And the integration simultaneously becomes the road you can walk.

Then integration is not some mysterious miracle. If you walk on the road with daily routines, gasshos and so forth, then very naturally integration is manifested. It is completely beyond calculation; you just have to do it.

And then if you practice in this way you can build up perfection of personality. In Japanese we say “enmon.” “En” of enmon means
“round;” “mon” means fullness. So enmon means round and full; we usually translate it “perfection.”

Enmon of personality is complete fullness of the energy, and very round. No corners. If you have a corner, even a slight one, it is what we call ego-consciousness; selfishness. If you are perfectly round, then when you bump into somebody else you just pass by and no one is hurt. But if you have a corner then when Jou bump into somebody you hurt. Very much. That corner is called the ego. Enman, perfection, is no ego; no corners, and full of energy.

<p align="center"> * * * </p>

In this country people are always emphasising positive living.
Live positively, think positively, see positively. Because the world is always creating negative things. Killing, fighting, divorce, no communication, children running away from home. Through the mass communication you get all this very negative information, and very naturally you fall into pessimism. You may not be conscious of it, but you get caught by that information in the mass media.

For instance, maybe you are about to help someone, freely and without discrimination. And then I tell you that the person you are about. to help is a bad person. Then you won’t want to help them, or you will hesitate. I may consciously tell you to help this person but unconsciously your body won’t move. This is unconscious advertisement.

Unconscious advertisement.

Well, in religion there is the brainwash.

It is pretty easy.

People will say that you should think in a positive way and see the positive things. It is positive, but it is still a kind of egoistic individualism.

It’s based on individualism.

It’s not peaceful.

It’s not perfectly round.

You have lots of energy but it’s not round. There are lots of corners to your personallty. So that’s why if you try to live positively there is always a certain purpose. A drive for a better life. Not caring about others. Always “I want.” This is very natural, and it’s very egoistic.

So the perfect personality is full of energy but simultaneously it’s not egoistic.

It’s very round.

No egoistic sense means you have to completely throw yourself into whatever you do. Not just for yourself. For all sentient beings. But usually you don’t do that. You try to live positively and you put yourself first. And then you live, positively. But this is very egoistic. So for a certain period of time you can be successful, but you fail to create a peaceful world where you can create peaceful, harmonious, perfect personality.

That is why it says here that it includes integration and includes the road. The communion, interpenetration, perfect harmony of intercommunication between the relative and the absolute must be manifested on the road through which you pass. That is everyday life.

> Merging is auspicious;  
> Do not violate it.  

#### Commentary:

This translation says “merging;” in Japanes we say “saku nen.” This means two things: intermixture, and holding in reverence. So merging captures one meaning, intermixture; but there is the second, holdig in awe and reverence.

If you want to have intermerging, intercommunication you have to hold yourself in reverence. In other words, you should pay homage to you. If you pay homage to you, to your position, to your everyday life, to washing your face and getting up in the morning, then you can realize that everything interconnunicates and interpenetrates.

If you practice like that everything helps your life. Before you are conscious of it. That is what is called to accumulate virtuous qualities, or plant the root of your life. If you practice like this, pay homage to your hands, to this table, to your walking and to the washing of your face, very naturally everything will support your life.

Because everything is impressed by this life. Not only people, but visibly and invisibly all sentient beings will help you. That is called merging.

It’s very true.

If you do this, very naturally there is a dynamical rhythm of merging with all sentient beings.

That is why merging is auspicious.

Very auspicious.

Because this merging is fitting exactly into the rhythm of the way, of the universal life.

Universal life as manifest in human beings has a certain rhythm. To have a certain rhythm means to have no fixed pattern of working and functioning. This is what we call the way, or sometimes the dharma: the perfect harmony of the rhythm of life.

That is exactly why merging is auspicious. If you practice like this very naturally your life will become auspicious. Because everyone will be very impressed. You can teach. You can respect and accept your life, and feel grateful for yourself and for others.


Do not violate it. Actually, I cannot violate anything. Even right and wrong, good and bad. Because even marijuana, drugs, right, wrong, good, bad, all sentient beings exist. Just like this. Just like us. Just like me. So there is no point, no reason that I can deny or violate it.

Because everything is merging. Everything pays homage to its own life.

A violet is a very tiny flower. But the life of the violet is respected very much by all sentient beings. Not only human beings; mountains, bees, insects, trees, rains, warmth. So if violet pays homage to its own life, all sentient beings help. But they don’t bother it; the life of the violet doesn’t violate anything.

In other words, your life seems to be separate but it isn’t. It’s really communicating and interpenetrated with all sentient beings. That means that what you live now is what everything lives.

With you.

So all you can do is pay homage to your own life; pay homage to each activity every day and very naturally all sentient beings around you will help. Because everything interlocks with your life.

If you act egoistically, even in the slightest, then you create a gap. That is called separation, or dualism.

So even though you don’t understand human life as a whole Picture, as a practical matter you can manifest it.

How?

Pay respect to your life, to your every activity. At that time you can interact, intercommunicate, interpenetrate, with all sentient beings. And everything helps your life. Many things are around you but you do not feel them as obstacles. You can accept the good and the bad, even the pain and the suffering. Because this is the human life as a whole picture. The real reality you are present in from moment to moment.

There are no exceptions.

> Naturally real yet inconceivable,  
> It is not within the realm of delusion or enlightenment.  

#### Commentary:

In Japanese we say “chin shin,” which means natural reality, natural principles, the ultimate facts of nature, the ultimate rhythm of being.

In life as a whole picture there is something going constantly as it naturally is real. Things do not interfere with each other.
All things are communicating, interconnecting, interpenetrating, helping each other; just going. This is the teaching of thusness, the dharma of nyoze: the rhythm, the perfect harmony of human life as a whole picture.

That is called naturally real.

But it is really inconceivable. It’s very difficult to know when and how it intercommunicates, interpenetrates. But actually, If you are very careful to keep your eyes open to the real reality you are present in from moment to moment, you can see it. That is why it is naturally real yet inconceivable.

Then, it is not within the province of delusion or enlightenment.


[...] not see delusion or enlightenment in the light of human speculation. In that light delusion becomes delusion, opposed to enlightenment, and enlightenment becomes enlightenment opposed to delusion.

In that way, even though you attain enlightenment, enlightenment really bothers you. If enlightenment really bothers you very much, you don’t want your enlightenment to interact with others. You really hold fast to enlightenment, with all your energy.

That is egoistic.

But inconceivable means the life as a whole picture is going in a way that is beyond human concepts, beyond human speculation. And this is completely beyond delusion or enlightenment.

Delusion and enlightenment are just names you place on life as a whole picture. Under certain conditions life is called delusion and under others it is called enlightenment. In one moment delusion turns into enlightenment, then enlightenment turns into delusion; always communicating with each other. That’s why you don’t know what word to use.

So the fact that delusion and enlightenment is completely beyond your speculation means that you should not seek delusion and enlightenment in the light of your speculation, but in the light of the Buddha’s eye. That means a global perspective. You Should see things not in the light of your reality but in the light of Buddha’s reality.

So delusion is Buddha’s delusion.

Once there was a woman named So Shin in China, who had a son. The Police came and told her that her son committed a crime. She maintained that the criminal was not her son, but someone else; she would not believe that her son would act that way. Another policeman came and told her the same thing, but still she would not be convinced. Then later the truth was found, that it was another man who had the same name as her son.

So Shin trusted her son from beginning to end, but within this perfect trust there was a delusion. Not the usual delusion, opposed to enlightenment, but Buddha’s delusion: it could not be my son.

She trusted him constantly. That is a mother’s delusion for her son. Under all circumstances she trusted him. It’s pretty hard: the policemen came, and at that time she was carried away with emotion. Maybe she cried, maybe not. But even if she didn’t cry her mind was always waiting. Just sitting there, trusting him, constantly.

To trust constantly, through and through is delusion.

Just like Avalokitesvara, filling his life with compassion. For what? To save all sentient beings. In order to help all sentient beings you must be deluded, because in order to help anyone you must trust them from beginning to end.

So this is mother’s delusion, this is our delusion; Buddha’s delusion.

Maybe you don’t understand the Buddha’s zazen, but constantly you have to keep your eyes open to how to manifest Buddha’s zazen in the zazen you do with your human body.

In any case you have to constantly try. You have to constantly De deluded by Buddha’s zazen. We have to have a basic trust in Buddha’s zazen. To trust in Buddha’s zazen you have to understand it through and through, just as the mother understood her son through and through.

So to trust is not to trust or believe blindly. Behind trust, behind the belief, there is a very strong knowing, understanding; very deep, through and through; a thoroughgoing way of understanding.

Constantly you have to understand zazen. To understand the zazen constantly you must first throw yourself into zazen. That is trust. And then you can Know, then you can understand.

> With causal conditions, time and season,  
> Quiescently it shines bright.  

#### Commentary:

So to know and trust doesn’t mean to just believe or accept something blindly. In order to accept and believe you have to have a thoroughgoing practice of knowing understanding.

What should you know?

Causal conditions of time and occasion.

This means we should know ourselves, as the seed of buddha nature. Buddha nature means greatness beyond human speculation.
Everyone is based on, present in, the seed of buddha nature. In order to know somebody or something or the self in a thoroughgoing way, you have to know the seed of buddha nature.

But usually we don’t.

Usually we trust ourselves or believe in ourselves in the realm of give and take, of utilitarianism. I say to you, if I trust You then please give me something. Very naturally people become Satisfied playing in the realm of give and take, plus and minus, success and failure.

That is called dualism.

Dualism means the self always comes first. Everything is seen in the light of the self. But to believe in or understand the seed of the buddha nature is to know that we cannot take care of ourselves separately from others.

If I want to take care of just myself, not you, then at that time my self is limited. You can put a certain name on it, and limit it.

But actually the self is not limited.

It is a very big being, with out limitations or any specific form. It is big beyond words. The self is always intercommunicating, interpenetrating with all sentient beings, so you cannot limit it.

But if you see yourself or others in terms of dualism, then very naturally we come first. The self sees the self in terms of the self. So it is very limited. But in life as a whole picture, real reality is completely open.

Even though you don’t understand, you understand.

Beyond your understanding the real reality of your life is constantly open in time and space.

What do I mean by this?

Life, the real reality of your life, right now, right here, is what?

No name. Nameless being.

This means that it is constantly fresh.

Is it old?

No.

Is it new?

No.

It is completely beyond old or new.

If you see yourself in the light of yesterday your life becomes old, and you fall into pessimism, or despair. On the other hand, if you see always the future and ignore the old, you become a wild pig. Rushing to some destination, without reflection on yourself.

That is very dangerous.

That is what is meant by living positively.

If you really want to go into the future bravely and positively you have to carry the old. Because without the old you cannot create the new.

But according to the Western idea of dialectic, the new should supplant the old. And to supplant the old you have to fight. And by this fighting you reach a higher level of human development.

But that is very egoistic.

The middle way of Buddhism, and the idea of emptiness, Is described in terms of negation, and so it seems to be a dialectic Enery. But it is not. Because we accept the old and the new simultaneously.

There is always the new, coming fresh. Without being limited by old or new. How can this be? If you accept completely the old you can be free from the old and create the new.

As a practical matter, it is called reflection. Very deeply, reflect upon yourself. Penetrate yourself, very deeply. Know yourself constantly. Not in the light of an egoistic sense but in the light of the Buddha’s eye. That is to completely accept the old.

And then that energy of acceptance of oldness lets you take one step forward as freshness. But if you don’t accept totally you cannot move. Usually we see old and new intellectually, and we think of them as alternatives. In everyday life, of course, sometimes you have to experience alternatives. But in the life of real reality there do not exist alternatives. Simultaneously you must accept and move, accept the old and create the new.

When?

Right now.

Not next moment.

Right now you accept the old and create the new.

This is our practice. This is Buddhism.

So the seed of buddha nature is something that makes you continually fresh. This is the real nature of human beings. That is what we mean by buddha nature: totally accepting the old, reflecting on yourself, and simultaneously creating newness. 

Whatever you do, every day you have to be fresh. Right in the Middle of washing your face, be fresh. When it is time to go into the zendo and do zazen, be fresh. Tomorrow, be fresh. That is what it means to realize the seed of buddha nature. That is reflection, to know somebody or the self. And then you have to put it into practice. You have to put the reflection into the practice of your everyday life, the practice of becoming fresh.
That is what we mean by shikan zazen, shikan gassho, shikan everyday.


So every day, life is good. A Zen Master said, “Every day is a good day.” This means that every day is fresh. Otherwise there is no chance to be free from karmic life. Through this practice you can understand what it is to be free from the karmic life, or yesterday, today and tomorrow; to be beyond time.

It does not come from discussion of terms. Discussion must be done after you practice. Then discussion will be pretty good. Otherwise the discussion will very likely be dreary, cold, and meaningless. Constant discussion can give rise to much confusion. It is also part of life, but sometimes it goes on endlessly.

So before you discuss you should know all sentient beings, others and yourself.

What is there to know?

Causal conditions of time and occasion.

That means that there is nothing to limit the real reality of your life. It is completely free. Completely open. And then you should act, do something to manifest that freedom. That is the seed of buddha nature.

But if you see human life in the light of dualism you cannot see this buddha nature. Because unconsciously you limit your and other’s life. But it is fun there. That is why people are content with living in the dualistic world, because there is always excitement. And before you can go deeply into things you can jump to something else and get something new. And if there is confusion at that spot you can change to something else.

So constantly there is no chance to get into the depths of beings, to see the seed of buddha nature.

But we have to know the seed of buddha nature, which is each existence. As a practical matter, we reflect on ourselves. How old we are. We come from the old, from the past. When we are born into this world we are immediately set up with characteristics; no chance to create anything completely fresh.

So in Zen Buddhism we practice, instead of believe. Practice, every day, being fresh. This practice is very quiet, but simultaneously it is very bright. If you practice like this you can see all sentient beings very clearly, very intimately.

> In its fineness it fits into spacelessness;  
> In its greatness it is utterly beyond location.  

#### Commentary:

This practice of promoting the growth of the buddha seed is very quiet, but it is very stable, very thoroughgoing. Rooted on the ground. Without creating feelings of competition or comparisons.

So we say that a poppy seed is the total manifestation of the whole world. This means that there is nothing to compare with It. Poppy seed is exactly poppy seed. Poppy seed is small but within the small there is total manifestation, total blooming of the whole world. That is why we can pay homage to the poppy seed
as it is.

But human speculation immediately compares it to something, like The Himalaya mountains. And then we depreciate the poppy seed:
“oh, that small thing.” That is a very common sense of values. That is dualism.

Real poppy seed is exactly a poppy seed blooming in the whole world. There is nothing to compare it to. And then you can really accept the poppy seed as it is and trust it. In order to do this you must have to know through and through what a poppy seed is. Buddha seed. No name to it, like “big” or “small.” Because poppy seed is a seed of buddha nature.

So what, then, is the life of the poppy seed? Just to let the flower of the poppy seed bloom constantly fresh from moment to moment, wherever it may be. That is what is meant here by in its fineness it fits into spacelessness.

Wherever you may go, whoever you are, you are small, you are not smart, I am smart, I am rich: these are just a sense of value as commonly encountered. What we have to know is that we are the seed of buddha nature, and we have to grow that seed, not the common sense of values. For this you should reflect upon yourself and how old you really are, and how within the oldness of your life there is a newness of life.

What is this?

Becoming fresh.

#### Text:

> A hairsbreadth deviation  
> Will fail to accord with the final attunement.  

#### Commentary:

If you miss the beat even slightly you cannot fit into the rhand of music. You slip off. So regardless of whether we understand Or not, our practice is to try to tune into the rhythm of music.

Regardless of whether you understand or not, you should keep your eyes open to how to tune in, because you are Buddha. Because you have to grow that seed of buddha nature. So you have already a great rhythm of music in your heart. Trying to tune into it is our practice. If you don’t, immediately there is a gap. That slight gap is huge, like the gap between heaven and earth. So it is pretty hard to live in peace and harmony.

In the Shobogenzo Dogen Zenji says that if you wish to understand the seed of buddha nature you should know that it is precisely the causal conditions of time and season. That is a big term; practically speaking it means time and space becomes fresh from moment to moment. It means there is no constant name that can apply to you. Good, bad, whatever. Nothing. Always you are fresh. So you have to live in this state of freshness. That is Buddhist logic.

Why do we have to gassho with wholeheartedness? Should we gassho blindly? Meticulously? Nervously? With great tension?

No. Just be fresh.

Does that mean we do it for no reason? Everything is emptiness, so why make something in emptiness?

There is a reason. There is a reason why everything becomes emptiness. Simply speaking, the logic of it is the causal conditions of time and season. That is a teaching you have to study for a long time, day after day.

But practically you can do it. You can practice, even though you do not understand. It is just like a TV set. You do not understand the structure of a TV set, but as a practical matter You can communicate intimately with it. Just press a button.

Imediately very complicated things happen, both in your head and in the TV set. When you drive your car here in the morning, do you know how many nerves work? Just when you sit down and start the car? 

You don’t know.

The same applies to getting up in the morning. Just push the button; just get up! That’s enough. But how many nerves go to work, very quickly! And sometimes you don’t want to get up. Sometimes you want to scream because so many nerves are going to work, conscious nerves, creating tension.

So even though you don’t understand, practice naturally, according to the suggestions of buddhas and patriarchs. And also study, very stably, try to understand the concepts one by one. That is the same as understanding the structure of the TV set, so you know what happens when you push the button. That is our practice and that is our study.

### Part 6

#### Text:

> Now there are sudden and gradual  
> In connection with which are set up basic approaches.  

#### Commentary:

According to the history of Zen Buddhism there were two disciples of the Fifth Patriarch Hung-Jen. They were Shen-hsiu, who became the founder of the Northern School of Zen, and Hui-Neng, who became the founder of the Southern School and the Sixth Patriarch.

One day the Fifth Patriarch said to the assembly that those monks who have experienced enlightenment should write poems telling him what it is. Shen-hsiu and Hui-Neng both wrote poems. Shen-hsiu, later founder of the Northern School, wrote:

> This body is the Bodhi-tree.  
> The mind is like a mirror bright;  
> Take heed to keep it always clean  
> And let not dust collect upon it.  

Briefly speaking, this means that Shen-hsiu attained perfectly the absolute after many years of practice. “This body is the Bodhi-tree” means that his body is completely pure, completely the absolute body. In Buddhism we cannot separate the body from the mind, so if you have a pure body like the Bodhi-tree then Inmediately your mind is like the mirror bright, working very Clearly without attaching to anything and accepting all sentient beings without discrimination.

*Take heed to keep it clean, “ because in human worla, particularly in everyday life, there is lots of dust. If you Tense up, immediately there is dust upon the mirror. So Shen-hstu expends great energy to keep pure body and mind, Enrough practice. And practice is nothing but a powerful means to keep body and mind pure.

Hui-Neng read this poem and then wrote one which was quite different:

> There is no Bodhi-tree,  
> Nor stand of mirror bright.  
> Since all is Void,  
> Where can the dust alight?  

According to Shen-hsiu the Bodhi-tree is something you can get after practicing with your impure body. Purity and impurity are something that you can get or avoid, through practicing or not practicing. If you don’t practice, your body is impure. If you practice, your body becomes pure. So very naturally this pursuit of purity opposed to impurity arises from a dualistic sense.

According to Hui-Neng the Bodhi-tree, the absolute, is completely beyond perception of purity and impurity. Irrespective of whether you think your body is pure or not pure, you are already perfect purity. That is what is meant by “There is no Bodhi-tree:” no perception of Bodhi-tree or not-Bodhi-tree.

This is supreme purity.

“No stand of mirror bright:” Mind is also supreme purity. “Since all is Void” means that it is purity beyond perception of purity or impurity: no form, no colors, no smell; nothing to grasp. If you can grasp it through your consciousness then you have fallen into the dualistic view.

No form, no colors, no smell means that something is constantly working dynamically. Atoms and particles do not arise and become matter by themselves; there must be energy to make them come together and take a specific form. So me give a scientific explanation and say that matter and energy are the same. Energy has no form, no colors, but still it is constantly working everywhere. When energy arises then particles appear and come together and make trees and birds, thoughts and Winter, many things. Forms you can percieve through your six senses.

That is why supreme purity is a Void, Nothingness.

Nothingness means constant working, constant motion.

So where can the dust alight?

Nothing can be brought into this Emptiness or dynamical working from the outside. If you bring even the slightest thing into it, then that thing is already conceptualized, fabricated by your consciousness.

That is why Hui-Neng said that there is no Bodhi-tree nor stands of mirror bright. No enlightenment, no ultimate nature of being.
Hui-Neng passed throught the net of enlightenment and works his human life in his everyday life. Forgetting that stage of enlightenment which deals with purity and impurity. Forgetting it and going on working. As a Buddha, as a pure being.

Historically we use the terms Sudden and Gradual to describe the Southern and Northern Schools. The school of Hui-Neng is Sudden Zen Buddhism. Sudden means you are already Buddha, so there is a
Sudden realization. The school of Shen-hsiu is called Gradual
Zen Buddhism. Because you must practice to gradually attain enlightenment, to purify body and mind. So this sutra says there are sudden and gradual, in connection with which are set up basic approaches.

Basic approaches means that we should understand the real meaning Of the teachings given by Shen-hsiu, founder of the Northern School, and that we should understand through and through the teachings of the Sixth Patriarch, Hui-Neng, founder of the Southern School.

---

#### Text:

> Once basic approaches are distinguished,  
> Then there are guiding rules.  

#### Commentary:

Set up basic approaches; if you understand some teaching then very naturally you can create a school or a denomination. If you create denominations then members of human culture naturally belong to one or another of them. Without belonging to some denomination you cannot live in this world as a human being.

You cannot ignore Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, or any of the many other religions. Broadly speaking, you belong to some denomination.

Not only religiously, but socially.

America.

You already belong to the big school of America. Or, in a smaller sense, you belong to the society of Minnesota, the society of the Twin Cities. Otherwise you cannot exist.

If you understand this teaching very deeply, you see how people in human history naturally create denominations.

Schools.

Societies.

Philosophies.

Americans. 

Japanese.

We can create categories or races, ideas or philosophies, and then people naturally fall into one or another of these.

And when many people come together in a denomination we have a conmunity. Just like this one. Many people living together, in what we call Minnesota. Many people come to live here, each individually with completely different ideas. Different ideas, different ways of life, different karma. Finally, if you don’t have any rules, the community becomes a mess.

Chaos.

So we need rules: Constitution, laws, regulations, morality, ethics and so forth.

Basic approaches.

So if you look at a particular denomination, you will see both the basic approach and the ultimate teaching. There is always the real meaning of the teaching of a certain religion and then a way to approach that real meaning.

Guiding rules.

The Buddha gave us the teaching of his life. Demonstrating this Shore where we are now and demonstrating the other shore where we Should be. It is the other shore because we are always moving toward the future; everyone has a destination. Where there is a destination then there is a way to get there.

One way is a philosophical way of teaching: structure of this shore and the other shore, philosophical and psychological Structure of teaching. The other way is a practical way of teaching. This means to put the teaching into practice. This means a way to get to the destination.

So the Buddha says, there is the other shore. And he teaches the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path. So he teaches the structure of the human world, including the other shore, and demonstrates very clearly how to get there.

Finally, there is how strongly you follow that way to get to the other shore. Intellectually you may understand the teaching and the approach pretty well. But emotionally it is hard. Because it is very complicated.

So everyone may understand how to get there and start to walk the path, but it takes time. Some go through directly and others don’t. They take lots of time and zigzag and slip off the path and go somewhere completely far from the right path. And then they realize that they are going in a different direction and so they come back again. And the next moment they are off, far from the right path.

So some reach the other shore pretty quickly. Others reach it just before they die. Some don’t reach it before they die. Those that don’t reach it still have the hope to practice continually to reach the other shore, life after life. So they don’t really suffer so much, even though they didn’t accomplish their purpose of human life in their own lifetime. They can face death quietly and stably.

So all the Buddha can do is show the teaching and the way to approach it. And what we have to do as individuals is walk on the path.

But then if you don’t progress, you criticize the teaching. Point to the teacher and say “It’s your fault.”

I don’t think so.

It is not the teaching’s fault; it is your fault. The Buddha Just shows the way; you have to do the walking. But it is very common for people to criticize the teaching instead of looking at themselves. Very common, and perverted. So before you criticize others or the approach you should look first at yourself.

---

#### Text:

> But even though the basis is reached and the approach comprehended,  
> True eternity still flows.  

#### Commentary:

This means that if you practice hard, research and study, teach and practice for many years, then you can experience what we call the absolute, or enlightenment. Very slightly you can glance at true eternity, eternal life. You will never be able to explain it, but as a practical matter you will be able to see a little bit of it. That’s pretty good, for us.

But if you try to experience this it will be hard and take a long time, because the eternal life is a really huge mansion. So you have to build up that mansion by means of psychology and philosophy and other subjects. And if you start to teach you have to teach this huge mansion, and it really takes time.

But if you experience it very naturally the eternal life is in your heart. So even if there are some aspects you cannot explain you can still demonstrate the eternal life.

If people look at someone who has experienced this, for example Shen-hsiu, the founder of the Northern School, they will respect him as a saint. As a pure being. Even though the basis is . reached and the approach comprehended, means that he can walk step by step according to the Buddha’s teaching. True eternity still flows; true eternity is always shown.

> Outwardly still while inwardly moving,  
> Like a tethered colt, a trapped rat ––  
>  The ancient saints pitied them,  
> And bestowed upon them the teaching;  

#### Commentary:

There are two Japanese ladies who meet with me every Sunday, when we talk about Buddhism. And one-Sunday one of them made a very interesting point. She said that as she studied Zen Buddhism her life became calmer and more steady. For instance, she said, if I give something to somebody I don’t expect anything back as a reward.

This is really pretty good. Because it is very difficult for most people to act this way. Just to give, without expecting anything in return.

Usually we say, live positively. Think beautiful thoughts.

Why? Because something will come back to you. It is very egoistic to expect a reward for something before you do it, but we usually don’t consider how egoistic it is. We usually just grasp the surface meaning of these words.

If you truly want to live positively you should live positively without expecting anything. This means you should just throw yourself into whatever it is you are doing.

That’s why Dogen Zenji says, “To learn Buddhism is to forget the self.”

That’s pretty hard to do. Because basically, in many ways, he come first. “The I.” So it is hard. But even though you don’t Talk about it you can give something to somebody without expecting any reward at all.

That’s a wonderful act.

And Dogen Zenji went on to say “That is my discipline.” To give.
That’s really wonderful.

This Japanese lady then said that although she could do it, to her it did not seem logical to give without expecting a reward.

So outwardly she is very calmly giving something while inwardly her mind is moving. Because the outward aspect of her life is based on a certain theory: give without expecting a reward. This is a theory for her.

If you exactly give, it is not necessary to say anything; just give. If you have to say something like “it is illogical” to people, that means you have some kind of a theory about giving. A “give with no reward” theory. Then the illogical way of giving becomes logical according to this theory. This is the practical aspect of the matter.

Intellectually and through your practice you can reach the top of the mountain, but you have to come back to the bottom again. And at that time reality is very complicated. You can’t deal with reality according to the experience you gained at the top of the mountain.

Reality is completely different.

Many things come up and many things are moving, outwardly and inwardly. Especially inwardly. Human emotion, human intellectual sense is always moving interconnected, interpenetrated, interwoven. So it is very complicated. And you do not exactly see it moving.

That’s why you can understand the teaching of giving without expectation, and you can do it. But it is very difficult to do something silently. You want to beat the drum and demonstrate that you are here.

So it becomes very difficult to stand up alone and unmoved and just to do it. What you want to do is beat the drum and get people’s attention. “Here I am, somebody who gives without any expectation of reward.” That’s why strikes and demonstrations are so interesting to people: because always there is an expectation.

But Buddhist practice is finally to do it very silently. At that time outwardly it is still and inwardly it is still. Otherwise it is outwardly still but inwardly it is constantly moving. And the problem is that people don’t notice this. Which is why practice under the guidance of a teacher is very important, because a teacher will pick up this situation and point it out to you.

And so I told this lady that her illogical sense had now become logical.

And she said, “Oh, yes.” She realized. Which is pretty good.

So the important point is that you must be still outwardly and inwardly. Because you can’t separate the outward life from the inward life. So apparently your life is still, and inwardly your life is still. Then you can really arrive. Because in the stillness you can really see a way to live dynamically. Because in the stillness everything is still, and you can see everything clearly.

But if the situation is very turbulent and noisy, you cannot listen to one particular sound, because there are so many noises. If you want to listen to one particular sound then the situation must be calm. Then you can hear everything clearly.

So here it uses the examples of a tethered colt and a trapped
You are always proud of yourself, thinking “I am a Zen student who has studied for many years, “ then you are just like a tethered colt. Outwardly you are very calm, but inwardly you are like a tethered colt or a rat in a trap.

Uneasy. 

And the more unease there is inwardly the more you want to demonstrate that you are good. Just like the [spitz]. Always barking at you. But it is just a demonstration, because inside they are very cowardly. If inside you are very strong then there is no need to bark at anybody. You can just stand alone, unmoved.

That is not an easy practice but it is very important if you want to live in human reality. Because reality is very complicated. You cannot handle it in terms of intellectual understanding, psychology or philosophy. These do not give us the way to live in peace and harmony.

That is why we have to practice.

That is why the ancient saints pitied them and bestowed upon them the teaching. You should pay attention to how to live in reality. You do not live in the teaching, not in psychology or philosophy; you have to be present right on the path of reality. Through which you can reach the other shore.

That is the teaching.

And you can feel how pitiful human beings are. This does not mean a critical feeling toward them; it means you can give them compassion. Sympathy to all sentient beings.

> According to their delusions,  
> They saw black as white --  

#### Commentary:

Sometimes the teaching says that white is black. This is very important: white is black. Because we always believe that white is white. And if I say that white is black you won’t trust me or believe me. Because we always stick to that common sense through which we can communicate with other people. So you never believe white is not white.

But you have to see white, and see simultaneously that white is not white. Sometimes white becomes black. This means you ask yourself, where does white come from? White does not come from white; white comes from black. So if you say “white” simultaneously black is there. So white is white and white is not white.

This means that the world of white is really big. So big it would overflow our common sense. So we quit at white is white. And then we compare these separate worlds and ask which is best.

That is why the teaching sometimes gives you white is black. which is completely different from your common sense. You have to listen to that teaching, even if you cannot understand it intellectually. You have to open your eyes to the teaching that white is black. And then you can have depth to your human life.

In college I had a friend who had a very shallow way of thinking; not deep at all. In a sense a shallow way of thinking is very nice: just like trees or animals. When you die, just die. That’s pretty nice.

He would often say, very proud of himself, that he had his head shaved in Tokyo. That means he becane a priest. Now I don’t think that just shaving the head is all there is to the priest’s life; the reality of it is very complicated. But he would just talk about this. And in the winter he would continue to wear the thin summer clothes, and be proud of how strong he was. I didn’t want to fight with him, so I just said “pretty good” to all this.

But that showed shallow thinking on his part. If you live your life according to shallow thinking then it is possible to be very realistic. You “understand” everything according to your intellectual sense and you can probably promote your life to what we call the better life.

But there is no depth.

No one is impressed by your life. You can reach certain stages: master languages or philosophy, or become a success in business. But there is no charming or fascinating quality to your personality. It is very shallow.

Maybe the people respect you as a businessman, but they don’t respect you deeply or from the heart. Because you are living your life based on shallow thinking, which guides you to being realistic, intellectual, and reasonable. If you don’t understand something intellectually you don’t believe in it. At that time you can be very realistic and you can be very successful.

But remember, there will be no depth, no fascination, no charm to your personality. So that is why the ancient saints called black as white. They must do things like that, to wake people up. To lead them to see the world in the broadest perspective.

The Prajna Paramita Sutra refers to Emptiness. Emptiness is not something that you “understand.”

Mrs. L. G. Mitchell, who lives in Boston and teaches English to foreigners at Harvard University, came to Eiheiji monastery to make the first record of life at the monastery which appeared in America. One of the faculty at Harvard University had given her a copy of the Praina Paramita Sutra. When she read it she could not understand it, so she asked him to teach her what it meant.

He would not teach her. Instead he told her to research and study it. Since then she has been interested in Buddhism and the Sutras. That is the interesting point.

So Emptiness is fascinating, a kind of puzzle; but it is not a puzzle. It is very true. And you should keep your eyes open to it. Even though you don’t “understand” it.

> When erroneous imaginations cease,  
> The acquiescent mind realizes itself.  

#### Commentary:

Erroneous imaginations means perverted views. In Zen Buddhism there are five stages one goes through in order to deepen one’s life and cease perverted views.

The first of these is the Bodhi mind.

This means the way-seeking mind. Originally all you see is a realistic picture of human life, which is dualistic. And then you touch the core of the human world and you feel something. That awareness takes you somewhere else, which is deeper than before. That awareness is a turning point, which leads you to go in a different direction. Once you see the core of the human world, the dualistic world, then it is very hard to stay there. You want something more. This is the way-seeking mind, or awareness.

For example, if you want to go to a University, but you know you lack some capability or are weak in some field of study, then you may go to a school and study that topic. If you are aware of the lack of depth in the dualistic human world then you want to go further. That feeling is the may-seeking mind.

The way seeking mind gives you the opportunity to practice. Then you take one step inside the spiritual life. That is the second stage: practice.

The third stage is when you accomplish, through and through, reaching the other shore. Once you take a step into the different world you have to go deeper and deeper, you have to reach the other shore. That means research, study, and practice, never give up, until you reach the top of the mountain. Because the buddhas and ancients have shown us where the top of the mountain is. When we reach it, that is the third stage.

The fourth stage is after you reach the top of the mountain: then you have to go back down into the human world and share your life with all sentient beings, forgetting the stage you have attained.

That is pretty difficult.

Because still you have perverted views. For instance, you beat your drum: “I am a saint.” “I am an old Zen student. You are beginners.” Consciously or unconsciously, you demonstrate, trying to get people’s attention. You don’t stand alone, unmoved.

This is natural, because the more you work hard at building your world and helping people the more you attach to it. Think of Jour parents and grandparents. Parents criticize children Decause parents have lived for many years and have worked to build their own lives and human society.

But young people don’t care about that. They want to just do as they please. They don’t make this effort to build up their own Ives, they just follow their instincts and desires.

That is what parents criticize.

Well, that’s all right, to give suggestions; but on the other hand parents are really attached to their way of life. They believe it is best. The more you are serious about your way of the more you attach to it.

So very naturally, if you practice Zen Buddhism very hard, you really attach to Zen Buddhism and you want to force people to believe in it because you realize how wonderful it is and how it helps people.

And it becomes a hard practice to forget and just help. Just help your children, stand back and support them. Sometimes with silence, sometimes with words. It’s very hard.

That is why there is the fourth stage, to come back from the top of the mountain and to share your life. For this, you need lots of practice.

For instance, you always criticize others, but you should pay attention to yourself. The buddhas and patriarchs have clearly Shown the way. All you have to do is walk. If you are not successful in walking the path, then immediately you criticise Buddhism or your teacher.

That is completely perverted.

That is why you should practice how to walk under the guidance of someone who has awakened.

I don’t know how often you will have tears on your face. I don’t Know, but it will be many, many times. Because the ancients will tell you that white Is black. It is very unreasonable, , parent to your common sense. And you become angry at ancestors, parents and teachers because it is so unreasonable.

But you have to pay attention to the reality you are present in.

How complicated it is.

It’s not so simple. If you want to share your life with all sentient beings, just give your life before trying to use something that has advanced in your thoughts.

If you know something more clearly, it makes you more complicated and more confused. The more deeply you know something, the more difficult it is to get into. Because intellectual knowledge comes first. So very naturally you want to know something more clearly and then after understanding it you want to get into it.

So knowing is wonderful, but knowing intellectually is not your actual practice. Because reality is completely beyond your intellectual understanding. Sometimes one plus one is two; sometimes it is one and sometimes it is twenty hundred.

So you should just forget your understanding and just live, with your best effort. To do this we need lots of help and guidance. This is our actual practice and it takes time.

That is the fourth stage. In the fifth you join human society and you share your life, but you forget that you are sharing your life with the people. You stand alone, unmoved, and share your life.

That’s pretty hard.

Because we always want to get something, to satisfy ourselves.

It is hard but this fifth practice is very important, because through this practice you can really deepen your life. You can really know what is at the bottom of human life. In our philosophy we say Emptiness; what is Emptiness? Through this practice you can really touch what aloneness is, what selfishness and pain and sorrow are.

At that time you can live with other people peacefully.

If you really want to develop your life, your life is exactly the same as the lives of Buddhas and Patriarchs. They followed a certain way of life, and so can you. Your life is not different from theirs.

So that’s why if you want to conform to the ancient ways, to conform to the perfect harmony of your life and the lives of all sentient beings, please observe what the buddhas and patriarchs did.

Because they are a very good example.

When about of fulfill the way of buddhahood: this means to become a Buddha. To become a buddha you stand alone, unmoved.

Act.

Just walk, like this. Share your life without expecting anything, and forgetting that you are sharing your life with people. Just stand alone, unmoved. Just act. This is called peace. Peace is to become Buddha.

So what is Buddha?

Maybe you can explain seventy percent of Buddha, using words. The rest you cannot explain.

At one time I became attendant to Hashimoto Roshi, and accompanied him on a trip to Nagoya where he was to give teisho on the Shobogenzo. The job of the attendant was to follow him wherever he went, and to buy train tickets if he needed them.

So this day he gave me his purse and told me to buy a ticket.
And when I opened the purse I realized there was not enough money. So I told him that the money was not enough.

He immediately replied, “If I had enough money I would not ask you, I would not give you my purse to buy a ticket.”

Do you understand?

He did not explain one hundred percent, he explained seventy percent. By giving me the purse. The other thirty percent I had to understand on my own: to use my money to make enough for the ticket.

It’s very illogical.

You always understand the seventy percent which I explain; do you care about the other thirty percent?

Someone can explain seventy percent of how to become a buddha, but they cannot explain the other thirty percent. But to become a buddha, you have to be a Buddha every day. That means one hundred percent.

So when he gave me the purse all I had to do was become a buddha and recieve the purse and buy a ticket. That is all I as an attendant had to do.

Do you understand?

That is to say, you need the practice of patience. And you need to be stupid, not smart. That stupidity lies in living your life just like a leaping fish. If you don’t have the money, do something else for him. Immediately.

Not only in the logical sense. Beyond logical, illogical you have to be buddha. If you deal with your life always in terms of logic then you only have the seventy percent. But Buddha’s world is one hundred percent. So you should know the illogical aspect of Buddhas’s life.

That’s why it says here that one gazed at a tree for ten aeons.

Ten aeons means countless, limitless number of years. If you want to be a buddha you have to walk in the eternal life, the world of ten aeons.

It’s very difficult to understand, but to do something in the eternal world means to become one with a situation, like the situation given to me by Hashimoto Roshi. I had to fit in there.

But immediately our intellect goes to work and analyzes and synthesizes and then we say it is impossible to buy the ticket.

But the important point is that we have to fit into situations given to us by our teachers or anybody else and become exactly one with it.

Without desiring to complete our satisfaction. Reasonably or unreasonably, we have to try.

That is called oneness. Oneness means completely beyond reasonably or unreasonably, you have to do it.

But we do things always in a reasonable way. Consciously or unconsciously, we try to complete our satisfaction. In many ways.

That is why the outside is very quiet but the inside is moving.

So to walk in the eternal world means to keep standing alone, unmoved.

Just do, every day.

That is called the practice in the realm of eternal life; ten
aeons.

It is like you have been thrown in the middle of the ocean. You cannot see the shore. Do you want to die?

No.

You want to swim, expecting survival.

But there are no guarantees. If there is no guarantee, should you stop swimming? If you want to.

But completely beyond you want to or you don’t want to, your body will start to move. Does your body expect something from the motion of swimming? No, nothing. Your head always expects something. But as a practical matter, right in the middle of reality, there is nothing to expect. Yet your body is moving with the ocean.

So where are you moving? Where are you swimming?

You are really moving in the realm of the ten aeons.

How can you move? How can you swim?

All you have to do is keep standing alone, unmoved. Just swim. That’s all we have to do.

But even right in the middle of such a situation, the head is very busy. So in a moment you see a boat, and you scream for help. Next moment the boat disappears, and you cry. But whatever your head does, beyond crying or sreaming or giving up, your body is moving with the ocean.

That is what it means to gaze at the tree for ten aeons. That is our practice. The practice of spiritual life. Otherwise there is no peace.

Like a tiger leaving part of its prey ... I don’t know why it was translated like this; in the Japanese commentaries it says that It was believed that a tiger got a scar on its ear every time it ate a human, and this line refers to a tiger with scarred ears. Very mature tiger, very expert tiger, having eaten lots of people. And a horse with a white left hind leg. It is said that certain kinds of white hair on a horse will glow at night. So this stanza means that after attaining buddhahood you are mature, and a kind of illumination will come forth from your life.

And before this the sutra talks about gazing at a tree for ten aeons. There is more to understanding the world than just using the intellect or attempting scientific understand. And scientific understanding includes I Ching, and astrology, and spiritual communication through telepathy and all those things which can be grasped by the intellect. There are many sciences: physics, biology, and the spiritual sciences.

The spiritual sciences are very complicated and they can make people very confused. They provide lots of information which seems to satisfy you, but the more you know of spiritual science the more you are truly confused, because you attach to that knowledge.

For instance, if you know the flavor of a certain dish, you cannot forget it. You attach to it. It is wonderful to know that flavor but there is a certain strong attachment there.

The more you know something the more you attach to it.

So as I have said before, when you devote yourself to accomplish something through a particular discipline, and you succeed, then you attach to that discipline. Because you now know many things, and understand how wonderful human life is.

That can be trouble for us.

That’s why, if you want to live in this world in peace and harmony, I don’t think it is good enough to understand the human world just through the intellect. He have to learn about the human life because there are so many things that we do not know. There is no end to learning about human life; not in this life, not in life after life.

So that is why we have to live in the human world, gazing at a tree for ten aeons, which means to walk in the mist of the eternal life. Eternal life is totally vast and there is nothing in sight. Not this shore, not the other shore. If you try to measure it by any of your yardsticks you will be discouraged in your practice, because it is impossible to measure or to expect to reach any particular goal. So intellectually it seems ridiculous to try.

Because as humans we are always trying to accomplish something in a fixed period of time. Work for ten years and get something; satisfy our desires. Of course you can plan like this. And somtimes you fail to accomplish your goal; or sometimes you accomplish your goal but still you are not satisfied.

So you want to polish your life some more. You reach a certain stage in your life and it’s wonderful but still you are not satisfied. So constantly you seem to accomplish yet there is no accomplishment, and always there is a contradictory feeling inside you. 

So when we walk in the eternal world we don’t know exactly where we are or why we are walking there. And when people don’t know Something they become confused. But you cannot know everything; there are always lots of things you don’t know. So the important thing is not to be in a hurry. Don’t rush; please be humble. Modest.

But people aren’t that way. If you don’t know something, you want to rush. Because people will put you down if you don’t know. And also, if you are ignorant of something you become angry with yourself. Or with others.

For example, you all do zazen. But you don’t know what zazen is.
The more you practice zazen, the more you don’t know what it is.
Just like your life. You do your best to take care of your life for many years, but now you are confused because you don’t know what the human life is.

But right in the middle of your life, in spite of your ignorance, you can touch something. The core of human life.

You don’t know what it is, but you can touch it.

So when you are ignorant of something very naturally people become mad at you and themselves and criticize you and others. That is arrogance. And you should be careful to avoid it, especially when you don’t know something.

When you don’t know it is completely that you don’t know. That means eternity. Something deep; so vast and deep that your intellect cannot grasp it. But in the Buddha’s eyes that vastness and depth is very clear; just like an ocean. But when the vastness and depth appears in the territory of your intellect, it becomes blurred. And we say, “I don’t understand this.” And at that time you become irritated. You are mad at your life and the world and other people, and that is called arrogance. Because it is very difficult to stand up there, quietly unmoved.

In Buddhist terms it is called “dukkha,” suffering. Suffering means you are standing in the middle of a world so vast and deep that your intellect cannot grasp it. So your intellect cannot stand up and be patient.

Suffering creates arrogance. Arrogance creates criticism, of you and others. And if you start to be critical then you create more arrogance, and hatred, screams and other kinds of things. And your life becomes very messy.

So, in order to know the human world in an appropriate way, and to live in peace and harmony with all sentient beings, we have to gaze at a tree for ten aeons; we have to walk in the mist. Day by day. Step by step. Just walk in the mist. That is our life.

And then, very naturally, your life will become mature. You will be like the scarred tiger and the horse with the white left hind leg. People will notice, and pay homage to you.

### Part 7

#### Text:

> Because there is the base, (there are)  
> Jewel pedestals, fine clothing;  

#### Text:

This stanza refers to the Lotus Sutra. In it there appears the story of the son of a nobleman who had left home and been reduced to beggary for many years.

Fifty years.

One day, by chance, he came to his own home and begged for food.
His father immediately recognized his son and tried to give him jewels and fine clothing; but the son was confused, because he had been a beggar for so many years and didn’t recognize his own father.

So the son ran away.

The father sent servants after him, and after they had fetched him the father offered the son the lowest task in the household: cleaning the toilets. After several years the son became used to working in the household, accustomed to living with the master of the house and all the servants. The father noticed this, and one day he had a big public party and announced to the world that this was his son. The son was now able to accept this, and took over the position and the jewels and clothes he had run away from before.

A similar story appears in the historical life of Buddha. Shakyamuni Buddha left his father’s house and began his religious life under the guidance of an ascetic religious teacher of his time. His father was very concerned about this, and sent three cousins and two servants to see what was going on around the Buddha. Fortunately or unfortunately, these five stayed on and became monks along with Shakyamuni.

After six years of asceticism, Shakyamuni came down from the mountain and accepted food from a young girl in a village. His five friends were disappointed in him, because he had broken the ascetic precepts; and they left him.

The Buddha went on to practice zazen under the Bodhi tree, and attained enlightenment one December the Eighth. And he decided to teach the experience of his life to his five friends. He preached to them the Avatamsaka Sutra, which is a philosophical explanation of the oneness of the world.

But unfortunately the teaching was at too high a level, and his friends didn’t understand it.

In the Avatamsaka Sutra it gives a philosophical explanation of the oneness of the world, in terms of what is called the Ocean Seal Samadhi. Samadhi is one-pointedness; Ocean refers to the Dharmakaya Buddha, or the Truth, and Seal means that the image of the world is reflected in the Truth. So the phenomenal world is not all that the world holds, for all these things are reflected in the Truth. So phenomena are already Truth.

Usually we misunderstand this. Usually we understand Ocean Seal Samadhi to mean that the Truth is a big, vast fushiki. You know, Japanese wrapping cloth. That is the Ocean. And then we put all phenomenal things in this wrapping cloth and we wrap them up and
tie it.

And carry it.

And that is supposed to be the Ocean Seal Samadhi.

And so there are trees and human beings, microphones and Katagiris and Winters and Summers, all wrapped up in the huge fushiki of the Truth.

I just read a poem by Mrs. Suzuki, which won a prize for haiku in Japan:

> There is no Rinzai, no Soto  
> Autumn sky.  

You feel the coolness, don’t you, through this?

What do you think about it?

As a poem, it’s fine. Because poetry gives you something more than your understanding, gives you something that lies behind your life. It can be sentimental, or romantic, or artistic.

There is no Rinzai, no Soto  
Autumn sky.

That means it’s not good enough, through this people misunderstand human life.

For instance, people think Autumn sky is a big wrapping cloth, and Soto, Rinzai, Christianity and Buddhism all come together in the Autumn skies.

I got a letter from a student in Los Angeles who practices under the guidance of a Rinzai master, and this master told him that Rinzai and Soto are both vehicles, like Caddilac and Lincoln Continental.

Soto and Rinzai and Christianity are just vehicles. Vehicles for what? To seek the truth, human truth.

So here is a big, vast wrapping cloth, a vehicle, and Soto and Rinzai and Obaku and Christianity and Americans and Japanese are all wrapped together.

That is a very common understanding. But it is nothing but a dualistic understanding, based on comparisons.

And it’s not true.

For Ocean Seal Samadhi means that all of the human world is reflected in Buddha’s world.

People often say that it doesn’t matter what religion you believe in, because all of them are seeking for a single truth.

People say this very often. And it is fine. But the reality of human life is something like this: you cannot mix them up.

For instance, in the Zuimon-ki, the Record of Things Heard by Dogen Zenji, he tells us that if the teacher tells you that a piece of worm is Buddha, you should believe it.

Now, how are you to understand this?

If I say worm is Buddha, and then you say “Yes, Sir!”

But then later you may have a problem with this and criticize me. Or if you don’t have a problem with it you appreciate me.

So how are you to understand this?

Worm is Buddha.

Maybe you think of the worm as a kind of a life, or an 1llumination, so-called buddha; and you mistake it for a kind of power. And you think that if you worship this worm it will help your life. Or maybe you try to find Buddha inside the worm.

No way.

You cannot mix them up.

Worm is worm. Budcha Shakyamuni is Buddha Shakyamuni.

Now your are confused. Because Dogen Zenji says you should see worm as Buddha.

Now think of that Statement that Soto and Rinzai and everything else is the same, because no matter what religion you follow, they are all seeking the same truth.

It is all right to say this, but I will give you hint: it is nothing but dualism.

It does not show an understanding of human life as lived in reality.

Because there are different ways of life, different religions.
And you cannot mix them up. You cannot mix up Christianity and Buddhism and Hinduism. If you say that all religions are seeking the same truth, then why do they fight each other. If you say that intellectually all religions are the same, and whatever you believe in it is fine, well, I disagree.

Because there is fighting and disputation about different points; and because of attachment to the various religious beliefs there is fighting and killing.

So the important point is: that statement is nothing but dualism.

Now I will tell you about Soto and Rinzai and Christianity. Soto must be Soto. Rinzai must be Rinzai, from beginning to end. Christianity must be Christianity, from beginning to end: manifesting the whole world, which is peace.

Christianity is Christianity does not mean the Christianity confines itself to its own framework. If it does, then Christianity cannot manifest the whole world, where there is peace. So Christianity must be Christianity from beginning to end, manifesting whole world where all sentient beings live in peace and harmony. At that time Christianity is Christianity, but Christianity drops off its own framework.

So very naturally Christianity can shake hands with our Buddhist religion.

So Soto is Soto, from beginning to end. Manifesting perfect peaceful world where all sentient beings live in peace and harmony. At that time Soto is Soto, but Soto is not Soto. Soto drops off its own framework.

For example, take sesshin. If you believe sesshin as a big wrapping cloth, then different people come here and become wrapped together in sesshin. By that understanding, you are part of sesshin. So, you are passive. And then sesshin becomes very painful for you, and you hate it.

Because if many people come together, and each thinks this way, each has his or her own idea about sesshin. And they bump into each other. Unfortunately, during sesshin you have no chance to express your emotions, so you are very quiet. Apparently very calm, but inside you are watching for the chance to get out. Like this sutra says, like a tethered colt or a trapped rat. Outwardly sitting very calm, but inwardly, no way.

So if you think of yourself as a member of sesshin, then there are always other members. And you compare yourself to them. Outwardly or inwardly, if there are more than one thing, you compare. That’s why you fight. If someone says a joke during sesshin, then you get mad. But the sesshin rules say you have to keep your mind calm, so you don’t fight very much. But the conflict is there. This is dualism.

No dualism means you must be sesshin. You yourself are exactly Sesshin. No gap between. At that time, Katagiri is sesshin. No concept or perception of the sesshin which you can see objectively. So, if you want to know sesshin, look at me. This is sesshin. Look at Tony. Tony is sesshin, exactly. So everyone is exactly sesshin, blooming.

So Tony is Buddha means Tony is Tony. From beginning to end, Tony must be Tony. Manifesting in that small territory which we call Tony the whole world we call sesshin, where all sentient beings live in peace and harmony.

Before thought, before comparison, there is what we call calmness, or tranquillity. Internally and externally, you become very still and calm. As a practical matter you have to practice this way.

Otherwise you have a certain uneasiness: you are worried, or concerned, or filled with hatred. So it is difficult to do.

Which is why we practice. Because we live always in the dualistic world. And we get used to living that way. That’s why even though I tell you about oneness, you don’t understand it. But you have to practice it, or you will never be able to live in peace and harmony.

For instance, you are all America. If you believe you are a member of America, then you have to pay attention to all the laws of America and Minnesota, as objects. But actually, you don’t. You live in peace and harmony because you are what? 

Exactly America.

If you want to know American laws and the American Constitution, look at Tony here, or look at Judy. The Constitution and all the laws are digested in their lives. At which time there is no Constitution.

Do you understand?

This is called the religious life. Morality. Constitution, laws, rules, all are completely digested into individual lives. At which time you are not a member of America; you become America itself, exactly.

So Constitution drops off its own perception. So if you want to know the Constitution you have to look at the individual lives. This is the ideal image of human life, which we term no-Constitution. No-government. With complete no-government, everyone will live in peace and harmony. But of course it’s impossible. So we have government.

But the purpose of government, Constitution, laws, is to be completely digested into individual life. And then government and Constitution turns into moral life.

Next the moral life must be completely digested into individual lives, at which time it drops off its own self-perception and becomes religious life. So if you polish morality it becomes religion. And next you have to polish religion through and through. And then you have peace. Perfect peace. No-religion.

For this religion must be thoroughly digested in individual life.
It means that if you want to see Buddhism, just look at Katagiri.
From beginning to end Katagiri is Katagiri, but Katagiri manifests ... what?

Not just Katagiri’s life. Buddhism. Whole world, which is peaceful.

So Katagiri, from beginning to end, must be Katagiri, manifesting whole world. At which time Katagiri drops of his perception of self. At which time there is no Buddhism.

Dogen Zenji said that when one side is mantfested the other is in
darkness. This means that the self is the whole world. You are the entire whole world. So worm is worm. It is not Buddha. So worm is Buddha means that if worm becomes worm from beginning to end, manfesting whole world, then worm drops off its perception of itself. And then we can really respect it.

We can respect nature because nature is always turning into this total manifestation of whole world. Something more than human mind. Human mind is very complicated, but trees and birds simply manifest the whole world. And humans must do the same. But the human mind is a little complicated; and so we have to practice.

So in the reality there is peace: no Rinzai, no Soto, and no Christianity. But that is not good enough. Because there are the Rinzai, Soto, and Christianity, very clearly. And both situations are interconnected, interwoven with each other. So it is very complicated. And you don’t know how to deal with it.

You cannot just say no Rinzai, no Soto, all religions seek one truth and the differences don’t matter. That’s not good enough. You have to think more carefully and look more carefully at the reality you live in. As a practical matter you have to deal with this reality where equality and discrimination are interwoven. This is reality. So how can you deal with it, and where?

That is why Shakymuni Buddha taught about the Ocean Seal Samadhi; but his first five disciples didn’t understand it. So next he tried to explain about the phenomenal world, in the Agamas Sutras. That is the very oldest Sutra. The Buddha always taught about human life in the most concrete way; so this Sutra is easy and interesting to read, but it is pretty deep.

Then the Buddha explained the Prajna Paramita, which teaches total equality. The Agama teaches about discrimination, the relative morld; the Praina Paramita teaches about total equality.

After that the Buddha taught the Saddharma-pundarika Sutra, or the Lotus Sutra, which describes the thusness and suchness of the whole world. In other words, oneness.

So, to be a Buddha we have to teach according to the individual personalities of the students; according to the circumstances. Because there is the base, there are jewel pedestals, fine clothing: even though you have a fine teaching, even though you understand Buddha’s teaching and give it, sometimes people do not understand. When that happens you have to digest the teaching through and through and then the words will come up from your own life. The same teaching, in different words, fitting into individual characters, individual life styles, according to circumstances.

That is what is meant by the jewel pedestals and fine clothing: you cannot give jewels and fine clothing to everyone; sometimes we have to give dirty clothes, and the job of cleaning the toilet.

#### Text:

> Because there is the startlingly different, (there are)  
> House cat and cow.  

#### Commentary:

Because there is the startlingly different: if you try to give fine clothes to everyone without thinking carefully of who they are, they may be startled. And run away from it. And so even if you understand a teaching you have to polish your understanding. hot only teachings; your viewpoint on life. It is fine if you understand your life, but you cannot direct people to live the may you do. You have to completely digest your views; and then they will come out in a different way, in appropriate words. It Is very important that we understand this.

Then this sutra talks about house cats and cows. A house cat lIkes the company of human beings but mainly it likes its house. Dogs really like human beings but a cat is more attached to the house. You may leave and somebody else may move in, and the cat doesn’t care. He lives with you or anybody else who comes by in perfect peace. He’s independent from people, remaining in peace and harmony, wherever he may be.

That is the independent way of life. To stand, alone and unmoved, wherever you may be. On the other hand, a cow is different; a cow is used by human beings.

It is very easy for me to be a cat. I just have to say that I am Katagiri, Abbot of the Zen Center, and no one should talk back to me. But I must also be a cow. I must also come back to the human world. Sometimes, in order to help you, I must be a student.

At other times I must be a cat.

In the Buddhist Sangha, we say that the Buddha Shakyamuni is not always the boss; in Buddhism, and particularly in the Sangha, we say that Shakyamuni is a friend. It is just like in school in the United States: teacher is always a friend.

But then there can be a problem, if you always relate to the teacher as a friend. You lose your perspective, and mix up what it means to be a teacher and what it means to be a friend. So sometimes students hit the teachers they don’t like.

That comes from a view that is a little bit perverted: the view that a teacher must always be a cow. If teacher becomes completely a friend, then the teacher is always on your side. If you believe that you are pretty mixed up. It is like the Statement that worm is Buddha. It is ridiculous to try and see Shakyamuni in the worm. Worm is worm.

Teacher is teacher. Cat. Teacher must be a cow, a friend, but Teacher must be cat, a teacher. Because this is true, mother becomes mother, but mother also must be a child. Otherwise she cannot nurse her children.

So in the Sangha the Buddha is a friend and not a boss. Teacher is a friend and not a boss. But this does not mean that a teacher is a cow, always on the student’s side. Because he has to be a teacher. So, teacher is teacher, but teacher is friend; teacher is friend, but teacher is also teacher.

In the [?] Sutra it talks about three kinds of communities. One is the community which has a boss. The other is a group where all the people are separate and independent. Those are the usual kinds of communities; one is just like a corporation, the other where people just live together with no boss. The second kind is pretty hard to organize and to have people live in peace and harmony.

The third kind of community is one which is constantly peaceful, which brings harmony to a community of people. That is called a Sangha. In this community there is a leader, but the leader mustn’t be a boss.

A boss has strong power to control the members, and this leads to a concern with fame, and wealth, and public reputation. This works for a while, but if there is trouble it can become a mess. If you lose the boss the community becomes completely perturbed; no one knows what to do. So the leader of the community shouldn’t be the boss. He should be a friend.

That is what is meant here by house cat and cow. Lead an independent life and be a cat; but also be a cow. Understand your own life and respect your own viewpoint, but give it to other people according to individual personalities and circumstances. Then you can really teach; then you can really live in peace.

> Yi, with his archer’s skill  
> Could hit a target at a hundred paces.  
> But when arrowpoints meet headon,  
> What has this to do with the power of skill?  

#### Commentary:

Yi was a famous archer, who could hit the target at a hundred paces, time after time. The only other archer who compete with him was his teacher, and so Yi shemed to arrange a duel with his teacher; whoever survived the duel would be the greatest archer in the world.

Yi shot an arrow at his teacher, and quickly his teacher shot one back; the two arrows met headon and fell harmlessly to the ground. This went on arrow after arrow, until the teacher had shot all of his. But Yi had one left. He shot it at his teacher, who snatched a dead branch and caught the arrow with it.

Yi was truly impressed with his teachers’s skill, and his teacher was truly impressed with Yi’s skill; and so they shook hands and made a deep bow to each other.

That is the famous story of Yi the archer.

So when arrowpoints meet headon, what has this to do with the power of skill? I think that not only in archery, but Buddhism, or being a housewife or an artist or whatever, if you want to climb the top of the mountain you can. You can study carefully and understand the mountain’s life, and the weather, and your body and mind, and reach the top.

It’s pretty common; anyone can do it. You just have to be a SlIful person, and learn lots of technique. Then you can reach the top of the mountain in whatever you do.

The Zen master [Ryokan] said about his poem: people take my poem as a poem, but my poems are not poems; this is my poem.

This is a very interesting point. Technically, if you try to polish your technique as a way of getting ready to compose a poem, you can do it. You can be professional. Being professional is pretty nice, but it is still not exactly right.

Exactly right means to hit the people’s heart.

I get to see a lot of calligraphy, written by professional calligraphers, and Zen teachers, and other people. My brother is a professional calligrapher. His calligraphy is very good, but actually I don’t care for it. Technically it is very good, but it does not leave me with a deep flavor. I can see a flavor there, but it is that of a professional calligrapher.

I often use the term “stinkiness” to describe this. Stinkiness is not a very good word, but I use it to mean the particular flavor of an individual. In Buddhist terms that is called karma. Karma is a big term, but plainly speaking it means the flavor of a particular individual.

Everyone has a particular, distinctive flavor. Even when you are sitting still in zazen, the way you sit shows me a particular flavor. It’s really very interesting.

So when the Zen Master [Ryokan] says his poems are not poems he means he is not a professional poet. Instead, he composes poems In his everyday life, and one day, without becoming conscious of It, he is a poet. So very naturally there is no sense of professional skill.

So if you read [Ryokan]’s poetry it is very nice and smooth and open.

Just as Vi’s teacher caught the last arrow with a dead branch.
That is not a professional, skillful way. It is completely beyond technique.

You have to be what you are, under all circumstances. That is something more than skill, or professionalism. That is why it says here, “what has this to do with the power of skill?”

So you can reach the top of the mountain of enlightenment in Buddhism by study. It can be done. But at that time the peculiar flavor is left behind. So the final goal for the human being is to realize the peculiar flavor and be free from that flavor. At that time your life goes smoothly.

That is a very hard practice for every day. It is harder than reaching the top of the mountain. That is why the Bodhisattva practices for many years. For instance, if you are an artist or a doctor, you can attain a certain stage. But after that your practice becomes harder. Because you have to share your capability and forget your own peculiar flavor. You have to become completely human, with your actions always based on compassion. Otherwise it is very difficult to share your life with all sentient beings.

> When the wooden man begins to sing,  
> The stone woman gets up to dance;  
> It’s not within reach of feeling or discrimination --  
> How could it admit of consideration in thought?

#### Commentary:

“Wooden man” and “Stone Woman” are technical terms in Zen; the meaning of this stanza is the same as the earlier “filling a Silver bowl with snow.” It means to be free of the particular Flavor which you as an individual possess. After reaching the top of the mountain, you cannot stay. You have to come down and share your life with all sentient beings. To do this you must fill the silver bowl with snow; your body and mind must be silver bowl, and whatever you do, they must also be snow.

At that time your life will really start to work. Start to work, but not logically. People will not understand you, and sometimes they will say that you are stupid. But your life will really work. That is called “the wooden man sings,” or “the stone woman dances.”

It is something more than human speculation or technique. For example, if you want to be a therapist, you cannot just depend on technique.

You must be human as well. Otherwise you cannot help people.

It may seem very illogical, because if you want to be a therapist you will study psychology and learn to use various techniques. Just to be human and understand another person’s feelings and emotions does not seem very important.

But it is very important.

When people are going to sit down in front of a therapist, they should feel immediately at ease. But there are some therapists who you can sit down in front of, and you don’t feel relaxed. There is a kind of tension there.

This situation is completely beyond technique. So you have to practice therapy and psychology or your occupation in a technical May, but simultaneously you have to refine and polish your personality as a whole.

This means you have to practice.

Practice means refined practice. Deallng with your life in terms other than those of a particular technique. A technical approach limits your world to a certain set of ideas. But your life is always going through something more than a limited world.

So you have to learn about your life not only from the limited world of psychology or philosophy or physics. You have to listen to the teachings of your ancestors. This is the spiritual life. You have to see your life in this way and practice those ancient teachings.

That is important.

And then very naturally you will deepen your life. So practice is something quite different from the learning technique. That is why it this sutra says, “What has this to do with the power of skill?” And if you practice this way the stone woman gets up to dance and the wooden man sings; your life really works.

So it’s not within the reach of feeling or discrimination. You sit down in front of a particular therapist and you feel relief. That is not your feeling. That is not your discrimination. Because before you can feel relief you must be relieved. That is the total picture of your personality, always working. You don’t know what it is; that is why it is like a wooden man or a stone woman. But it works every day. So it sings a song and gets up and dances.

#### Text:

> A minister serves the lord,  
> A son obeys the father;  
> Not obeying is not filial  
> And not serving is no help.  

#### Commentary:

These four lines refer to the use of lord, or prince, and minister, or retainer, to illustrate the Five Ranks. so the minister serves the lord. But behind this line, the lord must also serve the minister. You cannot ever take a one-way trip; you must always take the round trip. You should help, and then your partner helps you.

This is really hard to analyze.

For instance, a father serves his children. That means a father has his own stinkiness: “I am father.” So I help you. You are children, and you don’t know as much as I do. So you should obey me. And then the children don’t.

So the father should serve the children, and the children should serve the father. The father should drop off his own egoistic sense; otherwise the children cannot serve him.

Do you understand that?

So behind the line “A minister serves the lord” you should know there is another sentence, “the lord serves the minister.”

And then there is really peaceful communication.

The same applies to “A son obeys his father.” A father should Obey his son. This means the father should forget his position and listen to the son’s word. But it is difficult for us to do this. If you have a certain position or role in life and you Know how important that position is, you really attach to it because you are afraid to lose it. And when you really stick to your position you force other people to accomodate It.

So, not obeying is not filial. Whatever happens between the father and son, we should obey. To obey means to help each other.

Do something.

Without doing anything you can say “I am father,” or “I forget my position as father,” but no matter how much you say it, it doesn’t work. It is just like saying, “I know fire.” But these are just words. No matter how often you say them, fire does not burn.

So whatever happens, we have to do something. Obey. Help each other.
And not serving is no help. That is true. Dogen Zenji says in the Record of Things Heard, that if you should become a priest and break the precepts, you should reflect upon yourself as a bad priest. But that doesn’t mean you should leave the priest’s life and go back to being whatever you were. To break the precepts is not good for you, but it doesn’t mean you should turn back.

So you should keep the priest’s life, no matter how you feel.
That means constantly serving, under all circumstances. Always serving.

Because in a short period of time we don’t gain an understanding of something even in a little bit. In two or three years, you can’t gain an understanding of anything. And how about life? For Twenty or thirty years you have been taking care of your life, and you don’t understand it yet. Much less if you enter a new world and try to make it alive. If you give up and return to our normal way you will just have to start again from the beginning.

For instance, if you come from a city surrounded by smog, like Los Angeles, it is really difficult to breathe. But you don’t notice it. To try and serve the position of priest is to be present in a city surrounded by fresh air, instead of one surrounded by smog.

You can breathe pretty freely, even though the fresh air gives you preumonia. Fresh air helps very much. Even though pneumonia is hard for you, stay in the city surrounded by fresh air. Instead of going back to the city you are used to, the one surrounded by smog.

That is why Dogen Zenji says to stay with it and practice it. Walk in the mist, constantly. In a sense it is very hard.

In Zen Buddhism we say that seventy percent perfect is one hundred percent perfect. Seventy percent perfect means seventy percent of doing something is one hundred percent.

This is a very interesting point.

We try to do something one hundred percent but we cannot. When you manifest something you cannot manifest it one hundred percent. So you can only manifest yourself seventy percent.

But seventy percent is worthy of one hundred percent means the seventy percent is not seventy percent. Seventy percent is one hundred percent, which is why it is so valuable. So you should take total responsibility for that seventy percent. But if you see seventy percent as seventy percent, you don’t want to take responsibility for it. So you create some excuse.

But whatever you do, seventy percent is what you have done. So you have to take complete responsibility for it. Because it is worthy of one hundred percent.

So that is to constantly serve. If you look at yourself, you are not perfect. If you look at your zazen, it is not perfect. Seventy percent. But in Zen Buddhism seventy percent is one hundred percent.

When you achieve seventy percent then you can let the flow or the Iife force bloom in the middle of that seventy percent. Just like a tiny flower blooming in the heart of the mountains.

So that is what is meant by not serving is no help. We must serve, and then there is really help.

> Practice secretly, working within,  
> As though a fool, like an idiot --  
> If you can achieve continuity,  
> This is called the host within the host.  

#### Commentary:

But how can you serve, to help you and your position, professionaly and otherwise? Practice secretly, working within.

As I have said before, this means to plant the root of your life.
If you want something to grow, you have to plant the root. When you plan your life, maybe you plant a vegetable. This is good for a one-year plan. For a two-year plan you have to plant a tree or a fruit, something like that.

But for you lifetime plan, or the life of your life plans, you have to plant the root of life. That is called the virtuous quality.

But usually we don’t want to plant the root, because we are Interested in the fancy, visible stuff: branches, leaves, and flowers. So it is very difficult to plant the root, but the root is very important.

The practice which makes the root strong is very quiet; not showy. Practice secretly, working within. Egolessness.

Egolessness is very important for us. But i don’t mean you snould destroy the ego. Some people say that you become free from the ego when you get old. But I don’t mean that; that just means that the ego is enervated by old age.

Egolessness means that while you have the ego-sense you make the root of your life strong. That is why you should practice while you are young.

My teacher used to stress that whatever you want to do, you should first forget it.

And then practice it.

Then you will be able to do it anyplace, anytime later. What you have to do now is concentrate on practice. That is really to be egoless, because you cannot show your ego.

And even though you practice constantly, there is not much benefit. Five years, ten years, nothing happens.

If you get a PhD., or become a medical doctor, you will know how much you have practiced secretly. No one else will know; they will see the graduation ceremony, and congratulate you then.

But no one will see your secret working, for many, many years. No one will pay attention to that. But without it you cannot graduate and get your degree.

So you should forget your ego sense; but you have a very strong ego sense. If you want to achieve some goal, you want that goal.
But you should forget the goal, and concentrate on study. That’s pretty hard, but without it you cannot achieve anything, not even a small thing.

So practice secretly, working within. Like a fool or an idiot. Because no one is paying attention to you; there is no immediate reward. But it’s not really foolish, because you realize how foolish it is. If you don’t know how foolish it is, then it is really foolish.

Do you understand that?

Because you become foolish and know just how foolish you are, it’s not foolish because you can help yourself and other people. Just exactly help. So it’s not foolish.

Because even though you can help, you can see no reward for helping; all you see is hard work. Or nothing. So you say foolish. But that practice will work for you in the future.

So this is the real practice, the basic practice for human life.
Wherever you may be, whatever occupation you may have. If you forget this point, it is very difficult to take care of your life.

This is very basic.

If you become a dancer, or a professional photographer, or a housewife, there is much secret practice. Nobody pays attention to it. If you are a housewife and you cook, the family comes together and thanks you for all the wonderful food you have made. But you are secretly jealous [?]. There has been secret work, hard work. Behind this meal, how often you have secretly practiced. 

When I became a disciple of my teacher, I had to wash my teacher’s clothes and clean the temple yard, and no one knew.

But I had to do it.

And so it looked like I became a fool. But we should know how
foolish it is, because this is a basic practice. So you should know, a basic practice is to make you foolish, and turn you into an idiot.

Otherwise you cannot valk in the mist. It’s very ridiculous, so you should be aware of it.

And then, even though you know how foolish you are, and even though you know this is a basic practice for human beings, it is difficult to continue.

You have to continue; that is why this sutra says “If you can achieve continuity.” Not only today, not only for a certain period of time, you can be a cook or you can be a dishwasher. Becoming foolish. Anyone can do it.

We just have to continue our practice for a long time. It is important to us. It requires that need to contemplate strictly and sharply what is the basic nature of human practice. Contemplate deeply, constantly, what the basic practice is that we need to do to accomplish something.

Even becoming a babysitter requires the continuity of becoming foolish. Otherwise you cannot do it.

So for this you need to reach the bottom, the end of the rope. I don’t mean confusion; I mean the ultimate nature of being. If you reach it, there is nothing there. Well, there is only one thing left there, and that is motion. Going.

Going means you just walk in the mist. You just go on with your life. Whatever you feel, today comes. Whatever you feel, new year comes. Whatever you think, whatever you do, new year comes and goes.

So that is basic nature of being, ultimate end of being. Just soing. And you are right on that going, moving along with it. A nice walk. Just walking in the mist.

You don’t have to know what’s around you; all you have to do is Stand up there and walk. In the mist.

For this you need to realize the ultimate nature of being, just going in itself, and you see the nothing. But that nothing gives you a kind of energy. Because you are something going dynanically, and nothing else. Nothing else expecting anything at all, just going. That is what it means to get a certain energy: you just move. That energy is something that shoots up from the basic nature of being.

That is form, but strictly speaking it is compassion. Compassion is very deep, very deep. The only way you can see it is to follow the basic practice for human beings.

Your whole body and mind, your position, your capability, you job, all become compassion; all are embraced by compassion. Whatever you do, compassion moves. That is called the host within the host; that is the best way to live. Helping, serving, learning and creating, developing, living in peace and harmony.

Individually, that is the experience of freedom.

Enlightenment.

Freedom and enlightenment is not as difficult as you may think.
