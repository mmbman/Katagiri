## Teisho by Danin Katagiri Roshi 

This document is drawn from a series of nine talks given by Dainin Katagiri Roshi on the *Song of the Jewel Mirror Awareness*, from November 7, 1983 to January 1, 1984. Transcription of both series was made by Earl Broadbent. Jeff Broadbent edited that into two versions: one long, one abridged. (It’s not clear which version this is.)

### Introduction

This is a song.

In Japanese we call it Hôkyozammal, "Jewel Mirror Awareness," omitting the word "Song." But Manzan, a famous Japanese Zen master, stressed that the title should include the word "Song." For this is not only a very important sutra: it is a song, one which is chanted every day in Soto Zen monasteries.

A song appeals very deeply to your heart, and impresses you very much. Even if you don't understand it. We learn songs as children, often singing them before we understand what the words mean, and as adults we stils remember them.

This is why it is called the "Song of Jewel Mirror Awareness." "Awareness" of course means "samadhi." The Song of Jewel Mirror Samadhi.


So here we have a song which is also a very important sutra. You should recite it as well as study it, so that it becomes as much of you as a song of your childhood.

The Song of Jewel Mirror Awareness is a very simple sutra, consisting of 376 Chinese characters arranged into 94 phrases. It was written by the Zen master Tozan, who lived from 807 to 865, and who is greatly respected as the founder of the sotö tradition of Zen Buddhism. He also systematized the philosophical background of Soto Zen teaching into the so-called "Five Ranks."

***

Tozan practiced under the guidance of Ungan. One day he was to leave his teacher and set out on a pilgrimage to other Zen temples. Before he left, Tozan asked Ungan:

"After you have passed away, how can I answer someone who asks me what you were like?"

Ungan replied, "Say to him, just this is." Ungan then went on to say, "You must now be very careful, as you are carrying this great thing. Consider it again and again."

Do you see what Ungan meant by "Just this is?"

Tozan went on his travels, always pondering this statement "Just this is." Then one day he was crossing a body of water and saw his image reflected there. Immediately he understood the teaching of Ungan, and composed the following gatha:

> You shouldn't search it outwardly  
> If you do, the truth will become more remote from you.  
> But when alone I proceed through myself,  
> Wherever I go I meet him.  
> Now he is not other than myself, yet I am not he.  
> Only if you understand this will you unite with the Tathägata.  

If you want to seek the truth you cannot search for it outwardly. If you do, the truth will become more and more remote from you. The more you conceptualize, the more you try to achieve objective and rational understanding, the more complex and distant the truth will become. But in fact the truth is really very simple.

Tozan realized this and understood Ungan's teaching when he saw his image in the water. A reflection. So he very naturally saw that the reflection was not himself, that there was something, Big Self, True Self, beyond the reflection in the water.

Who could this be?

"When alone I proceed through myself." When you walk alone, when there is really the truth, Big Self.

"Wherever I go, I meet him." So True Self meets that reflection wherever it goes. And, "He is not other than myself." So True Self and reflection cannot be separated. True Self does not float around like some kind of spirit or ghost. But, "I am not he." So there is more to us than the reflection that our senses perceive. But on the other hand, reflection must be there, or there is nothing for us to see.

So, wherever we may go, we see the reflection. And this leads people to believe that the reflection is their true selves.

That is a completely perverted view.

But that does not mean we can ignore that reflection. Reflection is not the truth, yet without the refection we cannot see the truth.

So where is real truth, True Self?

Outside, or inside of you?

Exactly neither.

Because if you say outside, then you are just seeking the truth outside of yourself, and it will get farther and farther away from you, become more and mure conceptualized and artificial. If you say inside, you are still seeking the truth through your ordinary consciousness, objectively. What inside part of you is it?

Not "inside," not "outside." True Self is completely beyond our ability to discuss in words.

We can use language to create concepts and words, to see things objectively. When we think this way, we say that we understand, or that we know or don't know about something. But True Self exists completely outside any system of concepts. It is not something that we can capture in words and symbols.

It is something alive.

It is life itself, real life.

***

You don't think consciously about your breath or the beating of our heart when you go to sleep. If you did, you would become very nervous; maybe even schizophrenic. Even though you sleep, your heart keeps on beating. But there is no guarantee that your heart will keep on beating. Because a beating heart is something that belongs to this limited world. There is uncertainty with each heartbeat, a kind of crisis. Because you don't know whether or not your heart is going to stop. So your heart exists within the limits of its own life, and also in a state of crisis.

What, then, is a beating heart?

Is it some kind of object that you can grasp? There is some kind of object there, but it is not a beating heart. If it were, then when your heart stopped you could pour heartbeats into it, like gasoline into a car. But you can't. So should we worry about each heartbeat when we go to bed? No, because we would go crazy.

What, then, is it?

It is the real truth, beyond your ability to put into words or concepts. Before a conscious thought arises or does not arise, your heart beats. From moment to moment your heart is alive. And something which is alive is something which is interconnected, interpenetrated with all sentient beings. "All sentient beings" means more beings, visible and invisible, than you can see with your eyes, smell with your nose, or grasp with your mind.
