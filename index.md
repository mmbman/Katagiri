### [Blue Cliff Record, Case 42: Layman P’ang’s Good Snowflakes – Talk 2](1983-03-09-Blue-Cliff-Record-Case-42-Talk-2)
#### March 9, 1983 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi

Katagiri Roshi discusses the rhythm of causation, which is *not falling into cause and effect and not ignoring cause and effect*.  Representing cause and effect is Layman P’ang; representing freedom from cause and effect or *emptiness* is the monk Ch’uan. If you understand emptiness, you can become sick of emptiness. To avoid Zen sickness, offer a turning word. Also: Teaching without doing is not a good deal.

### [Blue Cliff Record, Case 42: Layman P’ang’s Good Snowflakes – Talk 1](1983-03-02-Blue-Cliff-Record-Case-42-Talk-1)
#### March 2, 1983 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi

Katagiri Roshi explores Case 42 of the *Blue Cliff Record*, in which Layman P’ang says, “Good snowflakes—they don’t fall in any other place.” As it says in the *Song of the Jewel Mirror Samadhi*, “Inquiry and response come up together.” If we really devote ourselves to doing zazen beyond our evaluation, accepting totally, we manifest ourselves in a totally appropriate way, and very naturally, everything will respond. We must jump into the realm of silence so that our life springs forth. Even if we don’t say anything with our mouth, our whole body speaks volumes. Buddha is not something divine, apart from us; Buddha has to go down to the human world and work.

### [Karma: Two Aspects](1980-06-30-Karma-Two-Aspects)
#### June 30, 1980 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi

Katagiri Roshi introduces a series of talks on karma. What is karma? Why is it important to study karma? Is karma only for Buddhist people? Is Buddhism itself only an aspect of Eastern culture? Can thinking about karma drive you crazy? Also: How to reconcile “aiming for the long range” with “no goal in zazen”.

### [Karma: Conclusion](1980-07-12-Karma-Conclusion)
#### July 12, 1980 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi

Katagiri Roshi further addresses the seeming contradiction that karma is both our property or inheritance and also is emptiness, freedom. This returns us to the reality of Buddha’s karma. We can reflect on ourselves and our actions without being stuck in the “ghost” of karma. Time and occasion and conditions are completely free, so day by day we can move toward the future, in order deepen our lives and help all beings. That is *Right Effort*. Also: Grace is not something that comes from heaven.

### [Karma as Energy / Emptiness](1980-07-11-Karma-As-Energy-Emptiness)
#### July 11, 1980 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi

Karma is not a psychological entity: karma is consciousness, but also karma is really the human body, closely related. So if we want to know karma, we have to know the human body; and if we want to know the human body, we have to know consciousness. According to the Twelve Causations, the base of our existence as karma is ignorance; but this ignorance is really vitality, allowing us to enter the gate of the human world. We should appreciate this. But we can’t just appreciate it without making any effort, because we carry many kinds of karma, stored at the bottom of human body and mind. This karma comes up only when time is right and conditions are arranged, so it is important that we arrange good conditions. We can do so because karma is a great source of energy, which we call *emptiness*. That means we can think in terms of possibility, and “dream the impossible dream” of helping all beings. Also: how to work with emotions in zazen.

### [Karma: Karmic Retribution in Present Life](1980-07-10-Karmic-Retribution-in-Present-Life)
#### July 10, 1980 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi

Katagiri Roshi discusses karma in terms of Dogen’s understanding, including three main points: *continuation of karma*, *karma as energy or emptiness*, and *Buddha’s karma*. He explains why Dogen Zenji emphasizes focusing on actual practice. *Karma* does not mean simple cause and effect or *action*, as a current popular understanding goes, but includes *unmanifested karma*, the impression left behind by our actions. Karmic retribution is illustrated by a story about a talking bear and a shockingly antisocial woodcutter. There is also a surprising explanation of the line “learn the backward step that turns your light inwardly to illuminate your self” from *Fukanzazengi*. All of this relates to *eko* – giving away the merit from our actions – which is viewed as the fundamental attitude toward studying the Buddha Way. Also: Be the turtle.

### [Karma: Taking Care of Karma](1980-07-04-Karma-Taking-Care-of-Karma)
#### July 4, 1980 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi

Katagiri Roshi further outlines meditation, *dhyāna*, as the way to study karma, which is the same as studying ourselves. He describes some key concepts in Buddhist psychology, particularly in a section on five aspects of consciousness. Even after reaching the final goal of religion, these five aspects of consciousness remain, because the body and mind still exist. This is why Zen Master Dogen says, “Nevertheless, flowers fall with attachment, weeds grow with hatred.” This body and mind are given to us as karma: we need to take care of them with compassion. The Suzuki Method for music education is used as an example of how to share our compassion with others, particularly with regard to *vedanā* (*reception* or *feeling*).

### [Blue Cliff Record, Case 4: Te Shan Carrying His Bundle – Talk 2](1980-05-18-Blue-Cliff-Record-Case-4-Talk-2)
#### May 18, 1980 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi

Katagiri Roshi examines Engo Zen Master’s notes on the meeting of Te Shan and Kuei Shan, and the dynamics between “process itself” and “doings as a result.” The wild fox spirit and the board-carrying fellow live right next door to each other. “Wrong” and “sure enough.” Check!

### [Blue Cliff Record, Case 4: Te Shan Carrying His Bundle – Talk 1](1980-05-08-Blue-Cliff-Record-Case-4-Talk-1)
#### May 8, 1980 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi

Katagiri Roshi comments on the famous dharma encounter between Te Shan and Kuei Shan. Te Shan is a former academic master of the *Diamond Sutra*, now an earnest seeker of the Way, just trying to work through his arrogance issues and perhaps have some dumplings. Kuei Shan is the abbot the monastery, founder of one of the schools of Zen, who won’t accept any “dregs” in the bottom of the bottle of enlightenment. Their encounter “under the blue sky, in the bright sunlight” still leaves us pointing out this and that.

Katagiri Roshi discusses the verse to Case 40 of the *Blue Cliff Record*. *Genjokoan* is mentioned. What is the *dharma stage*?

#### January 26, 1983 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi. 

Cease and desist. Why does Nan Ch’uan say we may see a flower as a kind of dream? Why do we need a push from the top of a one hundred foot pole? Also: is Buddhist community like army training?

### [Karma: Unmanifested Karma](1980-07-03-Karma-Unmanifested)
#### July 3, 1980 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi. 

Katagiri Roshi explains the difference between *manifested* and *unmanifested* karma, and why we need to understand both. Unmanifested karma is the reason why we have to take responsibility for our individual behavior. The difference between *public karma* and *individual karma* is also mentioned.

### [Karma: Where Karma Originates](1980-07-02-Karma-Where-Karma-Originates)
#### July 2, 1980 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi. 

Katagiri Roshi explains how *karma* is the source of our lives. He reviews Twelve Chain Causation (or the Twelve-Linked Chain of Causation, or the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination), noting that karma is *samskara* (link two) and *bhava* (link ten), and these are produced by *avidyā* (the first link: *ignorance*). But avidyā is really *vitality*: this is how we get into the human world of the present moment. He describes four stages of zazen, and five related consciousnesses: *vitarka* (thought), *vicāra* (discursive thinking), *prīti* (joyful interest), *sukha* (happiness), and *samādhi* (oneness). The descriptions of *prīti* and *sukha* in particular may be helpful in understanding what is meant when we see the words *joy* and *happiness* in English translations of Buddhist scriptures. Ultimately, the only way to understand karma is to do zazen. In the fourth stage of zazen, we are exactly one in the realm of source, which is karma. Then we can see what karma is.

### [Blue Cliff Record, Case 39: Yun Men’s Flowering Hedge – Talk 2](1983-01-19-Blue-Cliff-Record-Case-39-Talk-2)
#### January 19, 1983 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi. 

Katagiri Roshi discusses the Verse to Case 39 of the *Blue Cliff Record*, “Yun Men’s Flowering Hedge”. What is the real picture of a flower? There is an interesting statement of what *samsara* is, which is related to *Sandokai* (*The Harmony of Difference and Sameness*). The marks on the scale are on the balance arm, not on the pan. The rhythm of being means including all sentient beings.

### [Blue Cliff Record, Case 39: Yun Men’s Flowering Hedge – Talk 1](1983-01-12-Blue-Cliff-Record-Case-39-Talk-1)
#### January 12, 1983 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi. 

Katagiri Roshi discusses the Pointer to case Thirty-Nine of the *Blue Cliff Record*, “Yun Men’s Flowering Hedge”. To “observe times and seasons, causes and conditions” does not mean we should observe from a distance; we must observe *closely*, settling ourself in the self. “Times and seasons” means our life in the stream of the time process, and “causes and conditions” means the spacious dimension of our existence. Our life is in the pivot position, where time and space are working constantly in dynamism, whether we know it or not.

### [Blue Cliff Record, Case 38: Feng Hsueh’s Workings of the Iron Ox – Talk 2](1983-01-05-Blue-Cliff-Record-Case-38-Talk-2)
#### January 5, 1983 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi. 

The ancestors all convey Buddha Mind – magnanimous mind, compassionate mind, and joyful mind – to the next generation. This is why Feng Hsueh Zen Master explains Buddha Mind as being just like an Iron Ox. Katagiri Roshi further examines this case. Should we add our own ideas to Buddhism?

### [Blue Cliff Record, Case 38: Feng Hsueh’s Workings of the Iron Ox – Talk 1](1982-12-22-Blue-Cliff-Record-Case-38-Talk-1)
#### December 22, 1982 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi. 

Is the Iron Ox dead or alive? Katagiri Roshi discusses the gradual and the sudden, accepting Buddha Nature in the midst of the bustling marketplace. In order to hold, you have to let go. What is the Buddhist Law, and what is the Law of Kings, and why are they the same thing? The old pond: a frog jumps in. Plop! Also: do you need a boss?

### [Blue Cliff Record, Case 37: P’an Shan’s There Is Nothing in the World](1982-12-15-Blue-Cliff-Record-Case-37)
#### December 15, 1982 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi. 

If there is nothing that can be pinned down in the vast expanse of the universe, then where is the mind? *Where is the mind* is a question, but also it is already an answer: the answer of what the real state of human life is. The essence is always raising *(sic)*, just like a spring of water coming up. The continuation of flow makes a rhythm, or music; a concert, an orchestra. If we pay attention, and make ourselves simple and open, we can learn from this tune. Examining this case and verse, Katagiri Roshi shares the meaning of such poetry as, “When the rain has passed, the autumn water is deep in the evening pond,” and, “The moon’s brightness shines, revealing the night traveller.” Poetry and art are a shadow, but without them, we cannot approach the truth.

### [Blue Cliff Record, Case 36: Ch’ang Sha Wandering in the Mountains – Talk 2](1982-12-08-Blue-Cliff-Record-Case-36-Talk-2)
#### December 8, 1982 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi. 

Katagiri Roshi further expounds on “Ch’ang Sha Wandering in the Mountains,” focusing on the verse. He especially focuses on the first line, “The earth is clear of any dust.” This is Buddha’s world, which is identical with the original nature of existence. But also, “A mad monkey cries on the ancient terrace”: this is us looking through the telescope of our karmic perceptions. Buddhist practice is not to destroy all human delusions and *then* you can have Buddha’s world; we need both. Good or bad are nothing but time, but time is not good or bad. A monk walks in the snow without leaving a trace.

### [Blue Cliff Record, Case 36: Ch’ang Sha Wandering in the Mountains – Talk 1](1982-12-01-Blue-Cliff-Record-Case-36-Talk-1)
#### December 1, 1982 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi. 

Wandering in the mountains, life flowing freely: how very like the sense of springtime. Katagiri Roshi discusses seeking for the truth, and returning following the falling flowers. What is total communication between you and the mountain? Sages and ordinary people are the same, but what is beyond *sage* or *ordinary person*? Movement and practice responding to the rhythm of life. Also: how to get fired from a job in the human world. The caution against falling into the weeds is ironic commentary.

#### November 22, 1981 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi. 

Katagiri Roshi discusses the pointer to this case. What is our potential? What is the rhythm of life? What does it mean to be a “smoked dry fish,” and how can we avoid it? Should we look for a “flashy” enlightenment? Should we become a Zen bank robber? Also: How to cook puffer fish. How to lose money in San Francisco. And: wherever you may go, you can feel pain.

#### November 21, 1981 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi. 

What happens when we unexpectedly come face-to-face with real life, such as being paralyzed, or having cancer? Katagiri Roshi discusses “the big trap,” “one-finger Zen,” Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Sun-Moon-Light Tathagata, Adam and Eve, and how to educate children. Also: “Please, sit down.”

#### November 24, 1982 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi. 

Katagiri Roshi discusses Case 35 of the *Blue Cliff Record*, in which an obscure monk has a spiritual discussion with the Bodhisattva of Wisdom. Can we settle our uncertainties? Can we accept our lives in terms of infinity? Or will we be like a lion running around in a cage? If we find ourselves in a cage, how should we practice? Also: does it matter how many people come to our Zen Center?

### [Mindfulness – Talk 1](1984-03-21-Mindfulness-Talk-1)
#### March 21, 1984 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi.

Katagiri Roshi discusses the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, focusing on the first foundation: contemplation of the body as “impure”. This series of talks examines the “Thirty-Seven Elements of Bodhi” (*Sanjūshichi-bon-bodai-bunpō*) chapter of Zen Master Dogen’s *Shobogenzo*, which explains traditional Buddhist teachings in Mahayana terms. In this talk, he introduces the topic of why we must go beyond the idea of purity or impurity. He discusses how *samatha* (tranquility) and *vipassana* (insight) function together, and weighs in on the practice of meditating on the decomposition of human corpses. Also: why the word “Zen” is overused.

#### November 17, 1982 Dharma Talk by Dainin Katagiri Roshi.

Katagiri Roshi examines Case 34 of the Blue Cliff Record, which appears to be an ordinary conversation, but is actually an ordinary conversation in the broad scale of human life, which is beyond ordinary or not-ordinary. He explains the importance of paying attention to daily routine, and why we should get up in the morning. Also: how to practice compassion with emotions, how to be an actor, and how to be a not-actor.
