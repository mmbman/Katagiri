The [Talk Summaries](summaries) page lists just the talks that have been transcribed, along with a brief summary written by Kikan.

The [List of Talks](list) list the talks that are present in the [online audio archive](https://www.mnzencenter.org/audio-archive-project.html), with links to the talks that have been transcribed. There are many Katagiri Roshi talks that are not reflected on this list, because they are not yet in the online audio archive.

## Series of Talks

Katagiri Roshi gave many series of talks on topics in Zen Buddhism – some during a *sesshin* (meditation retreat), some over the course of a few weeks or months, and some ongoing for years. This list will be added to as more talks are transcribed.
