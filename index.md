description: Zen Dharma Talks by Dainin Katagiri Roshi
---

Dainin Katagiri Roshi was one of the prominent Zen Masters who brought Zen Buddhism from Japan to the United States. This website carefully transcribes his dharma talks as an aid to the study of Soto Zen Buddhism. [**About This Site**](about)

The [**Talk Summaries**](summaries) page lists the talks that have been transcribed on this site, with brief summaries written by Kikan.

The [**Talk List**](list) lists the talks that are present in the [online audio archive](https://www.mnzencenter.org/audio-archive-project.html), with links for the talks that have been transcribed. There are many talks that are not on this list because they are not yet in the online audio archive.

## Series of Talks

Katagiri Roshi gave many series of talks on topics in Buddhism – some during a *sesshin* (meditation retreat), some over the course of a few weeks or months, and some that were ongoing for years. Some of these series are:

- [**Diamond Sutra**](diamond-sutra) (1979-1980)
- [**Blue Cliff Record (*Hekiganroku*)**](blue-cliff-record) (1979-1989)
- [**Karma**](karma) (1980, 1987)
- [**Lay Ordination Lectures**](lay-ordination) (1986)

In particular, Katagiri Roshi gave many series of talks on the works of Zen Master Eihei Dōgen. These are some of the series on specific fascicles of *Shōbōgenzō* or related works:

- [***Fukanzazengi*: Dogen's Universal Recommendation for Zazen**](fukanzazengi) (1979)
- [***Genjōkōan***](genjokoan) (1987)

Readers should understand that because all Buddhist teaching is interrelated, these topics can and do come up anywhere in Katagiri Roshi’s talks, not just within these series.

These lists will be updated as talks are transcribed.
