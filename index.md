description: Zen Dharma Talks by Dainin Katagiri Roshi
---

Dainin Katagiri Roshi was one of the prominent Zen Masters who brought Zen Buddhism from Japan to the United States. This website carefully transcribes his dharma talks as a reference for the study of Soto Zen Buddhism. [**About This Site**](about)

The [**Talk Summaries**](summaries) page lists the talks that have been transcribed on this site, with brief summaries written by Kikan.

The [**Talk List**](list) lists the talks that are present in the [online audio archive](https://www.mnzencenter.org/audio-archive-project.html), with links for the talks that have been transcribed. There are many talks that are not on this list because they are not yet in the online audio archive.

## Talks Series

Katagiri Roshi gave many series of talks on topics in Buddhism – some during a *sesshin* (meditation retreat), some during a practice period, and some that were ongoing for years. Some of these series are:

- [***Diamond Sutra***](diamond-sutra) (1979-1980)
- [***Blue Cliff Record***](blue-cliff-record) (1979-1989)
- [**Karma**](karma) (1980, 1987)
- [**Lay Ordination Lectures**](lay-ordination) (1986)

In particular, Katagiri Roshi gave many series of talks on the works of Zen Master Eihei Dōgen. Some of the series on *Shōbōgenzō* or related works are: 

- [***Fukanzazengi*: Dogen's Universal Recommendation for Zazen**](fukanzazengi) (1979)
- [***Genjōkōan***](genjokoan) (1987)

These lists will be updated as talks are transcribed.

Readers should be aware that these topics are discussed in many places within Katagiri Roshi’s talks, not just within these series. Because all Buddhist teaching is interrelated, these topics can and do come up anywhere.
