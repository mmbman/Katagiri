> Pick up the whole great earth in your fingers and it’s as big as a grain of rice.

It seems to be difficult to practice or to experience this, but it is a very simple practice.

Even a grain of rice, according to our custom or habit, if you see a grain of rice, immediately the grain of rice becomes a being in comparison with other things. Himalaya mountains, which is big, bigger than a grain of rice. And also, in many ways, we compare. 

But practically, if you compare something with others, very naturally the judgment, evaluation, comes. If you judge and evaluate, next, affective preferences appear. 

So if you have affective preferences, it’s very difficult to handle a grain of rice as it is, because grain of rice is nothing different from the universe itself. The grain of rice as the universe is, anyway, no more than the beings, as well as Himalayan mountains, trees, birds, human beings.

That is a grain of rice.

“In the grain of rice there is a universe” means grain of rice is a being as it is. That’s all.

Before your affective preferences make a choice of it, that is the universe.

Pick up the universe, and see the universe right in the middle of a grain of rice.

That is completely not a matter of discussion, but that is just a practice.

So, Dōgen Zenji always teaches us the *Eihei Shingi*, the Regulation of a Zen Monastery. His way is practically very simple. Very simple.

When you are handle vegetables, when you handle a pan, pan is not pan. Because to you who is thinking, pan is something made by metal or wood, et cetera. Instead, pan is something you have to deal with as a buddha.

That means, before the affective preferences come up. You have to deal with the pan, water, vegetables, your feet, your *gassho*, your walking – as a Buddha.

Not completely mixed up. Not equality in common sense. If you say equality, that is the pan and vegetables are equal, which is called Buddha or universe. That is mixed up. No; the pan and the vegetables, spoons, water [are] completely universal. This is equality.

But practically, you cannot deal with pan and spoon and vegetables completely equal. You have to stand up, your mind, your body – anyway first of all stand up in the universe, equality. That means don’t poke, don’t bring your affective preferences, or judgment, evaluation.

And then next, you have to handle the vegetable as it is. Vegetable is different from pan.
Pan is different from vegetables. Water is water, pan is pan. 

So, you have to handle the pan as it is. Without handling, coping with it, through your evaluation, judgment, and affective preferences, et cetera. 

So, that is actual practice. 

That is really see the universe in the pan, see the universe in the spoon.

That is completely not a matter of discussion. You have to do it, from moment to moment.
Even though you don’t like it. You don’t like anyway, what is called chanting,
*gassho*, et cetera. You have to do [it], when you are in certain situation, which you have to do. 

Anyway, don’t bring in your judgment, evaluation, and just do it.

But, if you don’t like it, well, you can go away. Before you do. *[He laughs.]* Before you do, please go away.

But, if you are right now, right here, it is your life. Your life means, in Buddhism, moment.

In a moment, there are many beings, and also no excuse to escape.

Don’t you think so? Zazen, *gassho*, and sitting, [...] Look at this life. 

Practically, there is no excuse, no room to escape. But, you don’t believe, because your consciousness always looking at not only the moment, simultaneously before moment.
Before that, before present, after present. Always looking at the long range. Yesterday and tomorrow, and the next session of zazen, and breakfast, lunch, and dinners, and sleeping, et cetera. [We think]. But your body and mind is right now, right here. That is the practical. This is a practice you have to do.

But your mind is always looking at the many things. But those things are complete images, nothing but the images.

Of course, you should know yesterday, today, tomorrow. Fine. But, present life shouldn’t be chased away by images.

Images are images. Beautiful. We *need* images. But you shouldn’t be just dragged away by images. Present life, right now, what you have to do.

When *gassho* comes, you have to do gassho. If you don’t like, please go away. If you are here, please do. That’s all.

Go away, or stay.

If you don’t like, go away. Because you are free. Wherever you may go, it’s okay.

So, present life from moment to moment is very simple practice. No excuse to escape.

So, that’s why the...

We have to do, right now right here, without thinking, not thinking. If you think, immediately there is evaluation, judgment, and also what is called... thinking is based on, anyway, ignorance.

Ignorance is, anyway, arrogance.

So, thinking is completely limited.

Which is real thinking is completely perfect? No way. Your thinking is really limited. You don’t understand what is the truth.

The truth is not just something you can think. Truth is just being right on.

That is, in [a powerful way], this is the truth.

So, not thinking, okay? Without thinking, all you have to do is, anyway, handle the table, handle the microphone, handle your hands, your body, and your vegetables, and pans, and water, anyway, as it is. As a buddha. 

“As a buddha” means with compassion, okay? Compassion.

Big compassion.

Not “friendly,” okay? Not “kind.” Kind and friendliness is a *part* of the compassion, but kindness or friendliness is sometimes working pretty good under a certain situation, but not always. But compassion is always kind toward your object. That is compassion.

Vegetable, pan, walking, *gassho*, sleep – that is pretty hard, because in our daily life,
we don’t do this. Always we handle many things in terms of our viewpoint. That’s why it’s very difficult.

That’s why whatever you do in zazen, always there is something you can bring in. That is what is called arrogance.

Arrogance. Always.

Arrogance is very... interesting.

Arrogance is nothing but ignorance.

Ignorance is divided into three in Buddhism: craving, anger and self-delusion. This is ignorance.

But, craving is, many kinds of craving. Particularly five could be attachment, attachment to the form, the world of the form, formlessness, of the world of the formlessness. Attachment to the spiritual world. And also attachment to arrogance.

This is a big thing.

Well, I would like to [talk] about arrogance.

The face of arrogance is what is called overbearing behavior. This is the face of arrogance. 

For instance, there are three overbearing behaviors, briefly speaking. One is *equal conceit*. The other one is *inferior conceit*. The third is *superior conceit*. *[He laughs.]* It’s pretty good, isn’t it?

#### 

*Equal conceit* means, “I am equal.” For instance, you look at the people sitting *sesshin*. Well, there are many people here. Some have practiced for one year, or two years, et cetera. If you compare you with others: you don’t like. So finally you say, look at the people, and sitting, oh, they are sitting. Same as I. So you feel relief. *[He laughs, and the group laughs.]*

That is nothing but the equal conceit. Don’t you think so? It’s really conceit. You feel relief.

For instance, if you read the Dōgen’s *Shōbōgenzō*, you know, it’s completely far from my life, and the other’s life, modern civilization. Well at that time, it’s very hard, you know?
How can I follow his way?

And then I read, and I read. And even one sentence, you know, it says, “even though you are not good spirit of Zen student, all you have to do is just to walk in the mist. Wherever you are, your dress gets wet.” Oh – great! *[He laughs.]* So you find one sentence you can do. Okay?

*[Laughter.]*

So at that time, “Oh, that’s good! So, Dōgen is exactly the same as I!” You feel relieved. Don’t you think so? 

That is *equal conceit*.

#### 

The second is *inferior conceit*. This is very common, *very* common. “I am worse.”

Well, look at your zazen. Concentrating on zazen always, but your is immediately going away. And you take it back, bring it back to your zazen; next moment, it goes away again. And bring it back again... it goes away. *[Laughter.]*

Then you cry, you know? *[You think,]* “My zazen is worse.”

That’s *inferior conceit*. It’s really conceit.

I told you during the seminar (on [Karma](karma)): if you go to school, and the teachers always give you a definite, very clear grade number. A numerical grade. “Ninety-five,” or “seventy-nine,” et cetera. 

That is really clear: how your practice is progressing. And it’s pretty easy to compare your capability with others. Very naturally, because very clear numerical grade there. 

And then at that time, even though one point less than others, you feel inferior complex. Don’t you think so? 

For instance, sixty is the lowest. If you get fifty-nine, you [blow up], you lose. You lose.

And then, someone, your friend, gets sixty, he can pass. So sixty, and fifty-nine. Completely different. Don’t you think so? *[He laughs.]*

So, you immediately compare him with your points, and you feel inferior complex. So you cannot be with him, because already inferior complex.

Have you ever experienced this?

So I don’t want to give a numerical grade to you, okay? Even though you have a great Zazen, or even though you have a wonderful zazen and enlightenment, I don’t want to give you that.

Well, if you want, you can go to another school. Every day, the teacher checks you, checks your practice – whether you can pass the koan, et cetera. I don’t want to do this.

What I want to do is, just checking each problem with a cross and circle. That’s enough. 

So, if you see your examination, cross and circle. So if you see the cross: “oh, this is wrong.” Even though you have two crosses in your examination – well, it doesn’t matter. You don’t feel inferior complex. Still, you can open yourself and it’s pretty easy to correct: “oh, this is wrong.” So you can correct. And also you can be present with others who have a little better examination.

That’s pretty good for us.

For instance, in Tassajara, one of the persons who was very clear. He want to do everything very clear. He made a list. *[Laughter.]* Number one: get up in the morning, 4 o’clock. Second, go to the bathroom. Third, wash your face. Fifth, go to zazen. So all things, [...] everyday.

But everyday, even in Tassajara... Tassajara life is very simple, but even in Tassajara you cannot follow this, because your physical condition, mental condition, and also environment is completely changing.

So finally, he was very exhausted, because he cannot follow his schedule. He gave numerical grade to his life: number one and number two. And he couldn’t. So finally, he said, “I am a bad boy. I am not a good student.” So, very naturally, inferiority complex.

Of course, if you want to do that, that’s okay. You can make a list and try to do. But you cannot do completely.

Even though you cannot do it, [you pass it]. Just checking, checking. Number one, yes I did it. Number two, I did it. Number three, I didn’t. That’s all. So, next day, just correct. That’s enough.

This is *inferiority complex*, okay?

#### 53:52

*Superiority complex* is “I am better.”

You look at the students, maybe look at the students, and all students do like this, very seriously, and you also do this. But simultaneously you think, “Maybe my concentration is better than others.” Always “I am better.”

That is really the face of arrogance. Always over-fearing behavior.

Whatever it is, *equality* or *inferiority complex* or *superiority complex*, that is completely conceit. 

And the keystone of conceit or arrogance is to support or to uphold, that means to justify oneself. Consciously or unconsciously, you justify yourself. Don’t you think so?

Well, why do you want to have such a conceit? “I am equal,” “I am inferior,” or “I am better, superior,” conceit, whatever. Why? You want to justify yourself. 

In other words, you want to have self-protection. 

Self-protection is always seeing something in terms of individual views. This is a very common situation of human life. Always we see the table not from you, from *I*, individual. That’s why there is always immediately action comes up. That action is really to justify yourself or to protect yourself.

That is the taste of arrogance, or characteristic of arrogance.

Also, there is the movement of arrogance, tendency of arrogance.

That tendency of arrogance is always to attach the excellent or superior. Always you move, the arrogance starts to move towards, to attaching to the excellence. This is very natural, very natural.

That is arrogance. That is arrogance.

Look at politics. Politics shows, very naturally, very complicated. The political world is very complicated.

And also if you work in a company. Always you have your boss. Very naturally, you try to attach to boss, because boss is very powerful to you. If you don’t follow his way, you are fired, very naturally.

I told you before, I had a part-time job at the bookstore. And I really hated the owner, because the owner hated me, because I was a priest. He knew that I was priest. So he said, “Stand up here, look at this way.” I was very honest: “Stand up here, look at this way,” the entrance behind me. But from entrance, many people come in, but I didn’t see it. *[He laughs.]* He then scolded me, and next day I was fired. *[He laughs.]*

That is in companies, or wherever you may be, always human beings have certain tendencies, moving toward something excellent, to attach.

And also, the place where the arrogance is located in is... that is craving. Craving inadequate to the right understanding. That is a place where the arrogance is located in.

So that’s why arrogance is very powerful, because arrogance always has very strong desires to attach to something, keeping away from right understanding, Right View.

Right View in Buddhism means Four Noble Truths. Briefly speaking, everything is changing, and everything is impermanent. Life is characterized by suffering. So that is really *right understanding*.

#### 1:00:51

Okay. So there are seven arrogances, in a sense. 

The first one is the very common arrogance. According to traditional understanding, it says, “asserting the superiority over inferior, and equality with equals.” So, this is the arrogance, is that clear. Do you understand this? Very naturally, if you see the inferiors, you assert, consciously or unconsciously, superiority over them. Very naturally. That is really arrogance.

And also, equality with equals. Whenever they are here, everyone is your friend. Everyone is a Zen student, practice in equality. But there are differences, completely different qualities of the practice is different. But you think, in a way, you think everybody is equal. Equality. “Well, his practice exactly as I do.” So you feel relief. You try to justify your practice. Or you protect yourself, thinking equality.

Even families, brothers and sisters, are exactly the same, but different, completely different. Each person is different. And parents. And also if you go to school, some teachers, and classmates, you think all the same. But teachers are teachers, students are students.

That is the arrogance.

Second is “undue estimate of oneself.” Asserting superiority over equals, and equality with superiors.

Asserting superiority over equals: if you see everybody sitting here, and everybody is equal, your friend, but you think, “I am better,” that is “undue estimate of oneself.”

And “equality with superiors.”

Third: excessive conceit. Asserting superiority over manifest superiors. 

If you see somebody who is a little better than you, or a teacher, or whoever. If you see somebody as superior, you think of yourself as better than him. Superior. Is that clear?

For instance, let’s imagine there is a student who practices for seven years. And then you practice for one year. And then both attended *sesshin*. And then you really respect this person because he practiced seven years. And unfortunately, during *sesshin* he fainted. He fainted, and he left. And you say... “Oh. I am better.” *[He laughs.]*

That is really *excessive conceit*.
 
Next is *egotism*. Egotism is very common egotism. Egotism or over-weaning pride. 

Egotism is to depend on, to hang on a certain *ism*: nihilism, or pessimism, or Buddhism, or Christianity, et cetera. Set up something, and then you hang on. Japanese culture. “Japanese culture is better than American.” That is really ego. Conceit. 

So always we set up something, we wear the clothes, and then we feel relief, because we can depend on culture, or -ism, nihilism, communism, or democracy, et cetera. All things coming from egotism. Because we want to protect ourselves. 

If you have a certain *ism*. Democracy: if you have a strong democracy, many people follow you, they agree with your democracy-ism. And then naturally you feel good. But if you don’t have anything, it’s very difficult. That’s why consciously, unconsciously,
we always create a certain *ism*, or principle, culture, et cetera. That is really based on egotism, in other words arrogance, in order to protect ourselves.

If Japanese, I don’t have Japanese culture, it’s very difficult to depend on “I am Japanese,”
because there is nothing. So very naturally, I want to have the characteristic of Japanese culture, which is different from [...]. That’s why I can depends on. But this is really arrogance. 

That’s why, of course, we should respect this culture, but it’s not necessary to [...]. Open it, anyway, open it. 

This is anyway, what is called egotism. 

Fifth, an overestimate of oneself. 

Saying, vaunting or boasting. Boasting of, assertion of enlightenment. You don’t attain enlightenment, but you boast of yourself who experience enlightenment. “I am enlightened person.” But actually not. But you do this. 

That is overestimate of oneself. 

And also, the sixth is, over self-abasement. Abasement means unworthy of oneself. For thinking something very little.

No matter how long you practice zazen, always there is a certain... unworthy of yourself. “I am not good student.” Or, “I am a bad student,” et cetera.  

That is nothing but arrogance.

Sometimes this arrogance, self-abasement, is exactly same as false humility. Japanese is really false humility. Don’t you think so? If you go to Japan, Japanese always, “No thanks,” but on the other hand, “Please.” *[Laughter.]* So always, they refuse, you know.
If you try to do something, “No thanks, I can do it.” But on the other hand, “Please do it.”

Well, it’s not exactly. That is not only Japanese, that is the human mind always. Don’t you think so? 

American is, well, they frankly and clear. “Do you want to do?” “Do you want to need a baby-sitter?” If you say, “no,” that’s enough. *[He laughs.]* So, American people don’t understand Japanese way, because apparently always they refuse, but it is not completely refuse. It’s very strange.

For instance, if you write a book, sometimes the author of this book is not the real person who wrote this book. And the author puts his teacher’s name there. Americans don’t understand this. 

Or sometimes the temple, if you become founder of the temple, at that time, you are not the founder of the temple, your teacher becomes founder of the temple. This is very common in Japan. Even though your teacher died, you invite him to be founder of the temple. This is also very, we don’t understand this.

I took care of [...] in Boston, when she came to Japan. That was the one point she didn’t understand. Too much humility, too much. Too much humility. I think so, too much humility.

I don’t think the Japanese way is right, but I don’t think American way is right. *[He laughs.]* I don’t know what to do. That is your responsibility, okay? 

So that is, if you have too much humility, this is also arrogance. Remember this. This is very interesting.

The seventh is *false arrogance*. That is wanting lack of virtue for virtue. 

That is, well, the virtue means virtuous quality. Even though you don’t do anything,
very naturally, can you see the person who is taken care of very well by some other people, even though he is not exactly good person, but not exactly bad person, but he doesn’t do so much, but anyways, people take care of him. And then he believes, “I have this quality.” But actually not. 

He believes, “I have.” ...

#### 0:00

The monk obtained enlightenment under the guidance of a Zen master, and after that he went to the mountain and lived in a hut. Day after day he went back to the temple to have a meal each time. But all of a sudden, he quit, he stopped coming back to the temple to have a meal. So a teacher was very concerned about him, what happened to him. So he sent one of his disciples to see what happened there.

So this monk says, “It’s not necessary to go back to the temple to have a meal because I have a meal I am given by a celestial being.” Everyday celestial beings bring him his meals. Because that means his practice was very great. He deserved to receive the food from celestial beings; that means his virtuous quality was very good. 

The messenger came back to the temple and told about this. He said, “I thought he had been a great Zen monk, but still he did accept food from celestial beings. He is a stupid monk.” So he went to the hut and screamed and burned out the hut. 

If you do something, or even if you don’t do something, if you receive something good from others, very naturally we have arrogance, because I have consciously or unconsciously, you believe I have virtuous quality. I [am] “good boy.” That’s why... That is really arrogant.

So from like this, seven arrogances. Why do you do always? That is arrogance. *[He laughs.]* “I am an equal human being. I am a person as well as all of you.” This is also arrogance. And also, “I am a real bad boy, [worse] than you.” At that time this is also arrogance. If I say I am a “good boy” in comparison with you, this is conceit also.

So naturally always... because arrogance comes from ignorance. This is exactly ignorance. So whatever you do always there is arrogance.

That arrogance is really separate, two things, subject and object. And also you can immediately poke your head into that two things. So create a gap. That is arrogance.

If you do zazen, if you are completely free from arrogance, you can do zazen as you are. That’s all. Just do zazen.

But immediately arrogance pokes its own head into, between you and zazen, and between you and others. And [...] judge. And saying I am equal am I? Inferior am I?
Better am I? Worse am I? Always we say so. But that is nothing but arrogance.
So your zazen becomes egotism, individual egotism. It is [not]. That’s why we have to sit in the universe. Real zazen is the universe, that means no gap between you and the universe, no gap between you and others. So all you have to do is just sit down. Just sit down. As you are. As you are. If you see the mind going away, bring it back! Next moment it goes away again – bring it back. That’s all. Just do it. It’s not necessary to be feeling inferiority or feeling superiority or feeling equality. Just do it, with your best.

That’s why the koan says,

> Pick up the whole great earth in your fingers and it’s as big as a grain of rice.

If you pick up the rice, if you see the rice, there is no gap between rice and you. If you pick up zazen, there is no gap between zazen and you.

But there is always arrogance there. Arrogance separates, immediately separates two things. And if you separate, immediately your consciousness starts to work, and analyze, evaluate or judge. And next you can create effective preferences. And then, that’s pretty hard to stand up there.

And then always we, this main case says, 

> Throw it down before you: if, like a lacquer bucket, you don’t understand, I’ll beat the drum to call everyone to look.

So throw it down before you. That is really nothing but arrogance. Arrogance, immediately throw it away, and see what happens. 

That is experience. Experience is really something you can hang on. Even the good, even the bad, you can hang on.

But that means really throw it away, before you. But there is no truth. It is no truth. Truth is always with you, and which is quiet, very quiet. And it is always alive only when you are really active. Your zazen is active, your zazen is really active; at that time, from moment to moment without comparison, at that time it is really truth [...].

But we don’t know. We don’t know. Because we know the truth after throw away before you, and then say “this is truth.” I don’t think so. That is nothing but the arrogance. By arrogance you create something. That is sort of applause, criticism, pros and cons, success and failure. You stumble over, very easily.

But in zazen, it’s not necessary to do this. Zazen is exactly be right on the truth itself, the universe itself. That is zazen.

And also in your daily life - in the monastery, in the kitchen, in the *gassho*, in the cleaning house – anyway just handle a vegetable as it is, as a buddha. “As a buddha” means to take care of the vegetable with compassion. Compassion means don’t bring your feeling into it. *You’re* feeling. That’s pretty hard. Feeling is important, but feeling sometimes is egoistic. 

So anyway we have to handle the desk, the floors, and you, and your boots, and your clothes, as a buddha. 

To handle everything as a buddha means we have to understand everything first which is equal, completely equal. Next, you have to find differentiation in equality. Your boots are your boots. Your boots are completely different from vegetables. So we have to handle boots as boot. But that boots as boots is not to handle the boots with your emotional situation, but as a buddha.

That is our practice. It is very hard, because we always have had customs to handle, for many many years, with our feelings and emotions, and our arrogance, et cetera. That’s why it is very difficult to practice in that way. But this is very essential human practice. Not only zazen; whatever you do. But zazen is very pure sense. Nothing to do. As best as we can, life becomes simple, the simplest way. And then, just do zazen. That’s why zazen is very good, and can experience such a pure sense of human activities. In your daily living, it’s very difficult to experience this. That’s why we have to do this.

Okay. Do you have some questions? 

#### 11:38

**Question:** Hojo-san? I’m not exactly sure what the question is. It seems like there is a relationship between some arrogance and being self-protective, trying to take care of oneself. I find it confusing. I feel like I have been very arrogant this week, and not arrogant at all this week, or that. And when I look at this past week, it seems like somehow trying to take care of myself, trying to get enough rest and recover from two very exhausting weeks has led me to be arrogant in my reaction to other people. And it’s confusing to me because I would understand a way to be less arrogant would be to forget about myself, and not try to take care of myself, just forget about myself. And yet, that doesn’t seem like a good idea. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Well, exhaustion of your body and mind is not something you can see in terms of your viewpoint. Exhaustion is exhaustion. And if you see that exhaustion as a situation which is called physical exhaustion, and think it, compare with something, that is already you are thinking physical exhaustion in terms of your own viewpoint. Don’t you think so? 

**Questioner:** Mm-hmm.

**Katagiri Roshi:** But exhaustion is a being as it is. It comes. Do you create it on purpose? No way. Even though you don’t want to have physical exhaustion, sometimes physical exhaustion comes up. So you have to handle physical exhaustion as it is. Don’t you think so?

**Questioner:** Mm-hmm. I guess I’m thinking not so much about physical exhaustion, but more emotional...

**Katagiri Roshi:** Well, physical exhaustion is exactly the same as, well, backed by emotional exhaustion, psychological exhaustion, many things. That is a total picture of physical exhaustion, including emotional, psychological. That is your physical exhaustion.

**Questioner:** I think what’s confusing about it for me is, you know, in my understanding of Dōgen and my understanding of you and some of the other teachers, you seem able to just, in a sense, truly forget yourself.

**Katagiri Roshi:** No, no, I don’t mean *that*. I don’t mean... How can you forget yourself? “Forget yourself” doesn’t mean that you should commit suicide with exhaustion. Do you want to commit suicide with your exhaustion? Exhaustion is exhaustion, completely, as it is. Even though you don’t like it, if you work, there is the exhaustion comes up. At that time, you have to deal with the exhaustion as it is. But, there is always arrogance, okay? That’s why, do your best, take care of exhaustion. And then, don’t stay with exhaustion always, okay? Don’t feel comfortable with exhaustion, resting. 

So, sometimes, push yourself. Even though you feel a little bit, the 3 percent of the exhaustion left. But, if you push it, you can do it.

For instance, jogging, jogging [around the lake]. Well, almost one third, two thirds, well, you really exhaust. If you overcome this, it’s okay. But most people completely give up there. One third, it’s very hard, of running. Two thirds, it’s a little hard. If you overcome, you can do it.

Because, there is always arrogance. But, it’s not necessary to commit suicide, okay? *[He laughs.]* Commit suicide with exhaustion. But, remember this.

**Questioner:** So, you say then that when you see arrogance come up, in this situation that we’re talking about, it’s good to use it as a signal to take a rest?

**Katagiri Roshi:** I can’t say so. *[He laughs.]* Don’t create a certain “frame,” okay? Well, what is exhaustion? Many kinds of exhaustion. If I say, “If you see the exhaustion, take a rest,” you have to always just take a rest. *[Laughter.]*  [...]

I already exhaust. Last night, I don’t know what happened, I had pain in the back. I don’t know what happened. And then, even though I was sitting there, the pain was here. So, if that’s the case, if you feel pain, why don’t you rest? If you think so, many kinds of exhaustion, okay? Even the pain, et cetera. You shouldn’t mould pain or exhaustion into a certain frame. But you know pretty well, case by case. Sometimes you should take a rest. At that time, forget it! Anyway, take a rest. Okay? Sometimes, get up. This is pretty good.

Arrogance is not bad, okay? Arrogance is not bad. Don’t [...] the arrogance as a bad thing. Arrogance is completely arrogance. Whatever you do, always self-protected there. But it depends on how to use this arrogance. It really depends on [that]. If you use arrogance in a better way, in a good way, arrogance turns into compassion.

**Questioner:** Could you give an example of how...

**Katagiri Roshi:** Well, compassion, I always tell you about jogging. Arrogance, always arrogance there, running. Three miles, or four miles, six miles, anyway run. Well on the way, you can feel exhaustion. Really exhaustion. And you feel exhaustion of your legs, even though your spirit is very strong, physically you feel exhaustion. At that time you don’t want to run. That is really the comparing. Already limitation comes, “Oh my, running. Should I stop or should I go?” Always. Am I equal? Am I worse? Am I better? Always comparing.

So, well, you should know this. Always get it out. And then, anyway, let’s moves. Sometimes, let’s move. And then you can overcome. At that time arrogance turns into compassion. Anyway, you can take care of your life.

**Question:** Hojo? Would you say that arrogance is the same a dualistic understanding?

**Katagiri Roshi:** I think so... Because arrogance is one of the ignorance. Ignorance is exactly the dualistic word, thinking something in dualism. 

**Questioner:** But that’s the nature of the world. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Well, human nature.

Arrogance is comparison, in a sense. Sense of comparison. When arrogance comes up, there is a sense of comparison with others.

#### 21:11

**Question:** Hojo-san? You say there’s always arrogance, but can a person be free from arrogance, or... ?

**Katagiri Roshi:** Sure. That’s why in order to be free from, we have to have right view of the world, right view of human life.

That’s why we study Buddhism, we listen to Buddha’s teaching.

**Questioner:** But “right view” sometimes seems like no view at all.

**Katagiri Roshi:** [We always have a view.] What do you mean by “no view”?

**Questioner:** Well, if inferiority [and superiority] is arrogance, equality is arrogance...

**Katagiri Roshi:** No view, huh?

*[Laughter.]*

“No view” is also a view. “No view” is also a view you have.

So you need to come back... Perfect “no view” means don’t have no view.

*[Laughter.]*

**Someone:** How would you express that?

**Katagiri Roshi:** That is not a matter of discussion, anyway. If you want to do zazen, just do it.

And then, we can approach to, approach. We can have access to it through consciousness. That is the philosophy, psychology. But not *exactly* – right around, around this core, we can have access to it.

*Right there* is just a process, activity.

#### 24:30

**Question:** Hojo-san? Is arrogance always connected to thinking? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** I think so.

**Questioner:** So if you didn’t think, how could you be arrogant?

*[Laughter.]*

**Katagiri Roshi:** Well, already you are... 

*[Laughter.]*

**Katagiri Roshi:** How can you stop thinking? If you can stop thinking, it’s pretty easy. It’s not necessary to explain arrogance.

We are always thinking. That’s why we have to explain arrogance.

By thinking we create arrogance. Always there. 

That’s why I don’t mean that thinking is bad or arrogance is bad. We have to awaken to reality. How structured, it is made. That is reality. You are only thinking.

Well, thinking is [...] That’s why we have to awaken to it.

**Question:** Is it arrogance to view each thing as its own unique loveliness, to not judge anything, just to see it is really beautiful in its own way? And, uh...

**Katagiri Roshi:** What was your question? You are talking about no arrogance?

**Questioner:** Uh, yes, because accepting arrogance and seeing the world and everything around you as its own unique thing, its own loveliness...

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yes. Beauty of the world. Perfect beauty of the world.

“No arrogance” is that first of all you have to stand up in the beauty of the world. Perfect.

And then second, we have to practice it. We have to put it into practice in daily life. Beauty of the world into the practice.

That means day after day you have to handle the washing of face, and getting up in the morning, and the rest, and the walk, and the movement, but anyway.

But you cannot always [stand up] in the thinking of the beauty of the world. At that time, your life is way up in the air. So you cannot do this.

So, first of all, basically, we have to constantly stand up in the beauty of the world. That is the universe. 

From that attitude towards human life, compassion comes up. Compassion comes up just like a fresh water coming from the earth.

And that compassion lets you handle everything with kindness. Instead of creating too much stress, and conflict, by affective preferences. 

You can’t do immediately like this, but one by one, we have to practice constantly in that way. 

That is “no arrogance.”

So even though you don’t have a right understanding, but practically we can do in that way, if even for moment, we can do. 

And then, for instance, I always tell you, turn the switch constantly. If you want to see the picture of your life, turn on the switch. This is actual life.

Even though you don’t have a right understanding according to Buddha’s teaching, still there is a practical way everyone can do that.

That is, Dōgen always mentioned, in the regulation of Eihei monastery. So one by one, we can learn why we have to do this. That is Buddhist philosophy, psychology...
