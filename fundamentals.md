title: "Fundamentals of Zen"
---

This is a collection of talks in which Katagiri Roshi discusses the fundamentals of Buddhist practice, particularly those of Eihei Dogen, the 13th century founder of Soto Zen in Japan. Topics include the deeper meanings of the terms *zazen* (“sitting meditation”), *sanzen* (often translated as “practice”), *shikantaza* (“wholehearted sitting”),  *śūnyatā* or *kū* (“emptiness”), and also *ignorance*, *suffering*, *compassion*, and *faith*. There are also talks that touch on the Precepts, the meaning of the “three poisons,” and the understanding of feeling and emotion in Soto Zen. The talks listed here would serve well as an entry point into Katagiri Roshi’s teaching.

##### [What Is Buddhist Faith?](1985-06-22-Introduction-to-Buddhism)

The word may be problematic for some people, but what does *faith* actually mean in Buddhism? Buddhist faith is intimacy with total dynamic working. Katagiri Roshi discusses how “the way we should practice within the intimacy between our lives and emptiness” is “to bear up, to enjoy, to desire, and to be limpid and clear.” Along the way, he talks about quarks, and driving on the freeway in Los Angeles. The original title of this talk was “Introduction to Buddhism.”
