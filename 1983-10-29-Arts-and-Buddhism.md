**Katagiri Roshi:** [I went through] Customs, and the officer asked me, “What is the purpose of going to the United States?” 

*[Laughter.]*

So I said, “I am already living in the United States.” 

She asked me, “Are you a citizen of America?” 

I said, “No, I have permanent residence.”

But still I am a foreigner, so she continued to ask me, “You should write down what the purpose of going to the United States.” 

I wrote down in Japanese, “[*kitaku*],” (Kikyō? homecoming) which means going back to the home. 

*[Pause, followed by laughter.]*

Actually, if you are Japanese, you have to go back to Japan; that is called “going home.” But I am not American, so the purpose of coming to the United States is not actually going home. But I wrote “going home” unconsciously. So she said, “It’s funny! You are Japanese. Why do you say ‘going home’?” 

So I kept quiet. *[Laughter.]*

Anyway. I don’t know which is my home, but I am coming back. I am already in the United States, and I am very happy to practice again here.

#### 2:05

This time, I felt many things from Buddhism in Japan, in the United States, when I came back. When I went back to Japan, there are lots of things I would have to think how or what I should deal with Buddhism in the United States. Or in Japan I don’t know exactly what to do. But very naturally I realized that there are many problems, many questions, in American Buddhism. But only in American Buddhism – in Japanese Buddhism, too. 

Dogen Zenji continually mentions... *Bendo* means literally “transaction of the Way,” or, what would you say... *Bendo* is usually translated as “practice,” but bendo is something more than practice, because something you have to do, practically. So bendo means literally “transaction of the Way,” or sometimes people translate it as negotiation with the Way. But transaction of the way or negotiation of the way means to expend ones every possible effort or energy into the way. Do you understand? Constantly the focus of your effort or energy should be on the way. 

So Dogen Zenji mentions bendo, this bendo shouldn’t be seen in terms of life and death. But life and death should be in terms of bendo. This is very important point Dogen Zenji mentions. 

Buddhism is nothing but religion. But I don’t know the meaning of this term religion in English. But anyway Buddhism is... well, let me say, Buddhism is religion in the common sense. So if Buddhism is religion, Buddhism must be something giving, which should give perfect peace or harmony to human beings. Um... this human being shouldn’t be considered in the realm of human desires, but this human being should be considered in the equal level, in terms of the equal level of all sentient beings, including trees, birds, et cetera. At that time, human beings can live in peace and harmony. Okay? 

If you think human beings just in terms of human beings. So-called human beings have lots of desires, lot of greediness. So if you consider human beings just in terms of human being, very naturally, the rest of the beings are separate from human beings. So very naturally, you cannot live in peace and harmony. So in Buddhism always we think human being in terms of perfect equal level with all sentient beings. At that time we are called human being. So human being is what? Human beings are not human beings, human beings are *all beings*. Then you can live in peace and harmony. 

So for this, you cannot consider human beings always in terms of human desires. Human desire means always we want to satisfy. We want to satisfy the human desire, human feelings, always, wherever you may be. At that time, even though you get something which seems to make your life happy, but it’s not real peace, real harmony. 

So at any cost, if you want to live in peace and harmony, we have to see human beings in terms of Buddha’s teaching, or the Way, going beyond conscious or unconscious attempt of satisfying human desire. 

So that’s why Buddhism always emphasizes emptiness. Or egolessness. 

But if you look at Buddhism in the United States or in Japan... it seems to be very active. Particularly in the United States, Buddhism seems to be very active, helping human beings. It seems to be good. But I don’t know; it is questionable. I really feel it’s questionable. 

Because Buddhism is used always for the sake of conscious or unconscious attempt of satisfying human desire. If Buddhism doesn’t help, or if Buddhism satisfies you human desire, you don’t pay attention to it. 

So that’s why, look at Buddhism in the United States – Buddhism always tries to be considered in terms of help. In terms of the help of human beings, the human world. Seeing from the different angles: philosophy, psychology, and biology, and dance, and arts, et cetera. So that’s why Buddhism in the United States seems to be very active. 

And then somebody says, “Buddhism in the United States is best,” rather than Buddhism in Japan. But this is nothing but arrogance. So it’s very dangerous.

But this time I felt, Buddhism in United States, Buddhism in Japan – no different. The same. 

So that’s why Dogen Zenji mentions that from generation to generation, the buddha way, or *bendo* – bendo means expending your every possible effort toward the way. The way means beyond human desires, okay? There is a way, which feeding you always perfect peace or perfect harmony there, even though you don’t understand. So all we have to do is expend your every possible energy toward this. 

For this, *bendo* shouldn’t be seen in terms of life and death. So, completely opposite. It ought to be, rather, completely reversed. Life and death should be seen in terms of *bendo*. Do you understand that one? It’s very important. 

If you see the buddha way in terms of life and death, it means Buddhism is used for the sake of human desire. Always checking, evaluating, whether Buddhism is useful or not. In other words, you always pulled buddha’s way, or the way, with giving you perfect peace and harmony toward the human world. What is the human world? The human world is full of the attempt of satisfying human desires. In seems to be good, but on the other hand, lots of problems. 

So that’s why we want to practice zazen and we want to follow the Buddha’s way. Why do you practice Buddha’s way? 

So that’s why Dogen Zenji mentions that *bendo* shouldn’t be seen in terms of life and death. If you see *bendo*, buddha way, in terms of life and death, you always try to evaluate, judge, think, Buddhism. Well, checking always whether Buddhism is useful or not. 

At that time, such a Buddhism doesn’t last forever. 

For a certain period of time, Buddhism, of course, lasts. Maybe twentieth century? But not twenty-first century. So if Buddhism is real religion which gives perfect peace, perfect harmony, beyond races, beyond the way of thinking, it should last forever. From age to age. 

For this, even though you don’t feel good from Buddhism, you don’t see anything whether Buddhism is useful or not. We have to continue to expend our every possible effort toward the way. What [is] real peace, what is real harmony. 

It seems to me that peace means perfect harmony. Perfect harmony means the human world and also something more than human world come together, live together. That is called harmony. Not only the human world. Not only the human beings, and tape recorders, trees, birds, nature you can see, comes together. I don’t mean that. Anyway the phenomenal world which you can see, and also not-phenomenal world, beyond-phenomenal world, come together, live together, in peace. At that time it is called harmony. 

Harmony is not shake each-other’s hand: “Good morning. You are a good boy. You are a good friend,” et cetera. It is also harmony, but it doesn’t last for long. So what kind of hand should we shake? It’s not human hand. Anyway, we have to shake with the universal hands. 

So that’s why Dogen Zenji [says] that life and death should be seen in terms of *bendo*. 

That means that there is a sense of negation of human beings, human desires. You cannot always satisfy your desires. If you want to satisfy your desires, I don’t think it’s necessary to practice the buddha way, you know? Or religions. Why do you practice religions? In the usual world, there are lots of things that make your life satisfactory. So you’d better practice other things, rather than Buddhism or religion. 

Anyway, as a religion, I told you before, give you perfect peace and harmony, which means something beyond what you have thought, [or] you are thinking, or you think. So this is maybe a little bit against your human desires. Because you don’t understand it. If you don’t understand it, you don’t want to do it. You don’t want to follow. So even though I emphasize that just sitting is perfect peace, why don’t you sit down, but if you don’t feel good, you don’t want to do that. Don’t you think so? 

#### 

Well, not only Buddhism as a religion, but whatever you do. Here is a very interesting article, written by the Japanese philosopher. The title of this article is “The Practice of Sunyata.” Sunyata means emptiness. Let me read this, okay? One paragraph. He mentioned about the Japanese literary arts or Japanese art. 

> The inference of Zen sect lay rather in permeating the life of the age with its Zen spirit, and from here, in intellectually influenced the form of art. As arts under it’s influence, we can site the Noh drama, gardening, tea ceremony, *sumi-e* painting, and so forth. Every one of these arts has a common point that the moment of negation lies at its core. 

Well not only art. Being – human being, or your presence, lies in continuous negation. At it’s core, underlying essence, always negation. Because it’s emptiness. Emptiness means full function; nothing to import your ideas, your feeling into it. This is the basic picture of *being*. So philosophically we say *emptiness*. 

So broadly speaking, emptiness means to give perfect freedom toward human being. Because basically emptiness means you are free.

So that is negation. Negation means, whatever you think, good or bad, right or wrong, all are negated. At its core, underlying essence, always it’s negated. That means it is *emptied* by something. We don’t know what it is. But we call [it] *dharma*, or et cetera. 

So, “every one of these arts has a common point that the moment of negation lies at its core.” 

> The action of the Noh drama has the foundation of its distinctive form on the point that it’s not just a way every human peculiarity, from the movement of men. That is the actor. 

You know the no drama? If you see the Noh drama, it’s kind of dance, but the dance is moving very slow. So human actor as a human being acting, but there is no particular human peculiarity. 

The same applies to ballet, or other dance. The dancer should be human; but if you really want to represent perfect beauty of ballet, the ballet must be negated. The human peculiarity must be negated, right in the middle of the action of the dance. At that time, you can really represent perfect beauty of dance. That is ballet. 

So if you see the Noh drama, the actor moves very slowly. So in common sense, it makes you bored. It’s really boring – just like a tea ceremony. You don’t like a tea ceremony, because there is no particular movement, and very quiet. Nothing to expect as a reward. *[He chuckles.]* If you drink tea, it’s really bitter, not sweet. And also you must practice patience, sitting calmly. And then what you can see or hear is just the sound of a carol, and also activities of the host, nothing else. And the place is very small; nothing to excite you. 

And also, 

> ... hence, as its’ opposite form, it was possible to bring about later the puppet theater, in which all the peculiarities of man were exaggerated and instilled into the movement of the puppets, which were the actors. 

You understand this, okay? Actor is completely perfect. But if you just deal with the puppet as a puppet, you are not a puppet, you are not a real actor. So the actor is a puppet, but puppet is not puppet, puppet is completely negated at its core. There is no certain form which is called *puppet*. So it must be represented as a human being. At that time, puppet really acts on the stage, which is very attractive. 

So, always there is a puppet which seems to be dead, but it’s not *puppet*. It’s negated at the core. 

If you act as a human being on the stage, you mustn’t act as a human being. Human being as actor should be negated. And then, you can manifest the perfect beauty of the dance there. So always there is a contradiction there. But this is very true. 

So if you want to seek for perfect peace, or the Way – in Buddhist terminology it is called Way – the Way means harmony, perfect harmony. If you want to seek for the Way, you must be [an] actor, as a human being. But you mustn’t be human.

But look at Buddhism in the United States, in Japan. We are always acting as a human being. We don’t see anything else. So that’s why it makes you busy every day, ... human beings. Human beings are always just like a wild pig, rushing into a certain destination to satisfy their desires. So, no peace. 

> ... Similarly, the form of *sumi-e*, black ink painting, has as its essence for its essence that negation of all colors which nature possesses. 

This is *sumi-e* paining. Or even Western painting. What would you say, famous painter in the Middle Ages in Europe, what’s his name... Renoir? Look at his painting. It’s very bright, beautiful color there. But, he doesn’t use color which nature possesses. He completely digested the natural colors. So maybe dim colors. But within the dim colors or mixed colors, there is a perfect bright, natural color there. So he seems to be an expert how to use the color which nature possesses. Don’t you think so? I felt [so], anyway, from his painting. 

So if you alway express natural color which you can see, it’s not alive, it’s dead. But he knew how to represent natural color. That’s why his painting is beautiful. 

So I am talking about not only the Japanese arts. I am talking about general art, in Europe, in the United States, wherever you may go. This is real truth, anyway. 

> ... This also produced it’s opposite form in the Momoyama Period ...

That is almost the 16th century.

> ... as for gardening, it’s acme lies in the complete erasement of artificiality. 

It’s very interesting. So, somebody said the Japanese garden is a miniature of nature. So, if you say Japanese garden is a miniature garden of nature, well, that miniature nature is something artificial. Don’t you think so? Artificial. But it’s artificial because it’s made by human, but it’s not artificial. That’s why it is difficult how to represent in a small area. It’s very difficult. 

Because you must be human being, but you shouldn’t be human being, because you must be trees, birds – whole nature. You’re completely negated. When you are negated, you become nature. When you become nature, very naturally there is very smooth communication there. Before you think, anyway. This is the practice of gardeners. 

> And the tea ceremony attempts to make the men’s life egoless. 

Yes [it does]. First of all, anyone, if you are interested in – or even if you are not interested – let’s participate in a tea ceremony. Immediately you think, “What’s that?” *[He chuckles.]* Because [there is] nothing to satisfy your feeling. So that is already your egoistic sense is erased. When you sit down there, immediately your egoistic sense is erased. Just like zazen. *[He chuckles.]* Sit down. Then you don’t feel anything. That is pretty good, because egoistic sense is erased, perfectly, before you think. Whether you want to erase or you don’t want to erase, anyway it’s erased. The moment when you sit down there. That is called *shikan*.
