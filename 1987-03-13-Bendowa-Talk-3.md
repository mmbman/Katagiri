> Question 5: Concentration, *samadhi*, is one of the three learnings. Meditation, *dhyana*, is one of the six paramitas. Both of them are learned and practiced by all bodhisattvas from the beginning of their religious life, regardless of whether they are bright or dull-witted. The zazen you now preach would probably be included here as well. On what grounds do you say that the right dharma of the Tathagata is concentrated in zazen? 
>
> Answer 5: Your question is evoked because the appellation “Zen sect” has been given to the right dharma eye, the incomparable and great Dharma that is the Tathagata's one great mother. Bear this well in mind: the appellation “Zen sect” is met with in China eastward, it is not known in India. When the great teacher Bodhidharma was at the Shaolin Monastery of Songshan (Mount Sung) doing zazen facing a wall for nine years, the priests and laymen there not knowing yet of the Buddha's right dharma, initially said he was an Indian monk who placed special emphasis on zazen. Afterward, for generation after generation, each of the patriarchs devoted himself to zazen exclusively. Seeing this and not knowing the true circumstances, unthinking laymen spoke loosely of a “Zazen sect.” At present, the word *za* has been dropped and we speak of the Zen sect. Its essence is made clear in the recorded sayings of the patriarchs. Zazen should not be equated with the dhyana or samadhi of the six paramitas or three learnings. 
> 
> It is altogether clear this is the legitimate idea of the Buddha Dharma that has been directly transmitted. Many years ago, during the ceremony on Vulture Peak, the Tathagata entrusted the right dharma eye, wondrous mind of nirvana to Mahakashyapa alone. Some among the deva multitude now present in the heavens actually witnessed the ceremony. Therefore, there is no reason for any doubt. The Buddha Dharma as a matter of cause is forever protected and maintained by the deva multitude. Their efforts never succumb. You may know without doubt that this zazen is the absolute way of the Buddha Dharma. It is incomparable. 

Okay, question five is, there is a very fundamental study of Buddhism, according to the ancient Buddhism. There is three learnings: *precept*, *wisdom*, and *dhyana* or *samadhi*, *dhyana*. Here it says in the note, he says, 

> ... three forms of Buddhist learning: discipline (*sīla*), concentration (*samadhi*), and wisdom (*prajña*), thought to be the fundamental “studies” every Buddhist practicer must undertake.

And according to a structure of the Buddhist teaching I think there are three categories, so-called Tripitaka, Sutra Pitaka and Shastra Pitaka and also Sila Pitaka. The group of the Sutra, group of Sita, precepts, group of Shastra, commentary, on the Buddhist scriptures. The Buddhist teaching consists of those three in ancient time.

And in terms of Buddhist practice, Buddhism is divided into the three points, that is called the three learnings, precept and wisdom and samadhi. 

And also with the development of Buddhism, particularly in Mahayana, we have practice of Buddhist teaching called the six paramitas. Six paramitas here it says in the note, 

> The six “perfections” (*paramita*) are practices by which enlightenment can be attained: donation,
precept-keeping, perseverance, assiduity, meditation, and wisdom.

Donation means *giving*, *dana*. Sila, precept. And perseverance, patience or perseverance. *Assiduity*, that is *effort*, [*vīrya*]. Meditation, zazen and wisdom. Those are the six paramitas, as Buddhist practice in Mahayana Buddhism. 

So the question here says, why [does] Dogen Zenji emphasizes particularly the zazen alone, *dhyana*, or *samadhi*, separated from the rest of three learnings and rest of the six paramitas. Because this question, always paying attention only one thing, so-called dhyana or samadhi, meditation separate from the rest of the things. So the question, what they, they take one dhyana and paying attention to it and deal with it particularly, separate from the rest of the things. So that’s why this is a little bit of question. Question here is already questionable, because already they deal with one thing particularly separate from others. Okay? But strictly speaking, if you deal a practice as a whole – practice means a Buddhist practice, zazen, or kihin, or whatever – in our daily life, it is really impossible for us to separate from others. Because if you do zazen very naturally in zazen there are the rest of the learnings and the rest of the six paramitas must be there, otherwise meditation *dhyana* doesn't make sense in our daily life. Particularly, we call reality, reality we live in from moment to moment is consciously very vague, but strictly speaking, it is very clear, because all beings work together and create one thing. So it's very clear but intellectually, it's very vague, because it's very difficult to analyze, to separate from others. 

So our life is always going on right in the midst of that reality. But intellectually, if you explain the Buddhist practice, I think we can explain Buddhist practice as three learnings, but this is nothing but the Buddhology, okay? Buddhist studies. So separately you can explain what the sila, is why it is necessary for us, and also wisdom, and dhyana. Separately you can deal with. 

So that is already questionable, that's why Dogen Zenji points out what is the significance of zazen we do. The last sentence he says, “You may know without doubt that this this zazen is the absolute way of the Buddha Dharma.” In the original text it's called *zen do*, zen means integrated, or complete, or the whole. And *do* is a way, or sometimes utterance, but way, way is fine. So, what would you say, the integrated way or whole way of the Buddha Dharma, means the whole spirit of the Buddha Dharma, the integrated spirit of Buddhist teaching. Not the one thing picked by picked by somebody, or picked by some idea among many Buddhist teachings, okay? If you research Buddhist teaching, you can analyze you know Agamas, Abhidharmas, and Avatamsaka Sutras, Madhyamakas, and many teachings there. But Dogen Zenji tried to present the whole or integrated spirit of the Buddha's teaching. Which has been handed down from generation to generation. That is a key point, that's why Dogen Zenji mentions the point which he is speaking of is integrated spirit of the Buddhism, not the “Zen sect,” not the particular teaching called “Zen sect.” So Dogen Zenji doesn't like so much the particular sect denominations. So even the Zen school, even the Buddha Mind school, whatever you say, Dogen Zenji tried to avoid a particular name, the appellation called “Zen sect,” et cetera. Because he constantly present total whole picture, whole spirit of Buddha’s teaching. That's why finally his teaching must go back to Buddha’s teaching. What the Buddha’s teaching is like, you know.

So from here, in his answer, I think he mentions from where the appellation Zen sect comes. So I think here it says, since Bodhidharma came to China and practiced zazen at the Shaolin temple for nine years, and people unthinking, or not knowing the true circumstances, gave a certain name on the teaching of Bodhidharma called “Zazen sect” or “Zen sect,” because Bodhidharma always sitting. So that is very clear, because the many recorded sayings of patriarchs already mentions about this. So the name of “Zen sect” is based on a very, what to say, not stable resources, not definite or clear resources. 

So many among the ignorant people, anyway, they put the name on it. For instance, in the United States we say “Zen student,” okay, because you do zazen, and study zazen and Zen Buddhism, that's why people call you “Zen student.” So that is naturally people put the name on you. But it doesn't come from a definite and clear resource. So that's why Dogen Zenji mentions here, “At present the word *za* has been dropped and we speak of “Zen sect,” its essence is made clear in the recorded sayings of the patriarchs.” Zazen shouldn't be equated with *dhyana* or *samadhi* of the six paramitas or three learnings, because it is just a teaching in words, talking about what the Buddhist practice is. And so the Buddhist practice is separated or divided into three points; you know, *sila*, wisdom, and *dhyana*. But that *dhyana* is completely different from the *dhyana* Dogen Zenji mentions because dhyana Dogen Zenji mention implicates or brings on the total whole spirit of the Buddha’s teaching, including wisdom, sila, and dhyana. If you practice dhyana, very naturally you can bring on the precepts and dhyana, in other words precepts, wisdom should be included. But it goes without saying that it is not necessary for us to practice sila or precepts – of course it is necessary. But if you practice sila or precepts, precepts shouldn't be separate from dhyana or wisdom. The practice of sila should be backed by wisdom and dhyana meditation, otherwise sila doesn't make sense, or sila doesn't work in our everyday life. If you practice sila in our everyday life, very naturally, wisdom and dhyana should be included, naturally. So constantly the dhyana that Dogen Zenji present that zazen as a whole.

And also next he says, finally he emphasizes, the primary events ... of the Buddhist meditation, in the ancient time when the Shakyamuni Buddha was alive. So that is, he says, it is altogether clear this is a legitimate idea of the Buddha Dharma that has been directly transmitted many years ago during the ceremony on Vulture Peak. The Tathagata entrusts the right dharma eye, wondrous mind of nirvana, to Mahakashyapa alone. Well, you know pretty well these stories. I think in the note he mentions, on Vulture Peak, Brahma came and implored the Buddha to preach for the benefit of sentient beings. The Buddha held out a lotus flower before the assembly of devas and men, but none of them understood him except Mahakashyapa, who smiled. Then the Buddha exclaimed, “I have the right Dharma eye, the wondrous mind of nirvana. This I entrust to you, Kashyapa.” According to the Zen school, this marks the beginning of the Zen transmission. This account, together with those telling of the Dharma transmission up to Hui Neng, may be found in the Lian Teng Fui Yao, Lian Tou Roku. So it is said that story is the beginning of Zen transmission, dharma transmissions. 

And also, in other words, Dogen Zenji tried to give historical proof. If you don't understand anything now, I think we should learn historical proof, human history. We have to follow the historical events. In other words, I mentioned the other day that we have to emulate historical customs, and fabricated by human in the history. Well, if you want to be a barber, very naturally you have to imitate what the ancestor did. So you have to emulate and imitate the practice presented by ancestors. This is called *learning*, we have to learn something. 

So Dogen Zenji, because even though you think about zazen, about barber, with your intellectual sense you don't understand what the barber means, how the people trust you as a barber. We don't understand it. So finally, if you want to command respect from the people, anyway you have to follow the ancestors’ way, and emulate it, and practice. Naturally people trust you, and naturally people call you barber. 

So that's why Dogen Zenji returned to the beginning of the history, beginning of the Dharma transmission in the Zen tradition. That's why he said like this. 

And also he says, 

> Some among the Deva multitude now present in the heavens actually witnessed the ceremony.

It means still there are many devas, some devas who witnessed that ceremony. In other words, there are some devas who participated in that ceremony in ancient time. Can you believe [it]? *[He chuckles.]* Deva means guardians, and gods, you know, the divine entities, something like that. Devas. According to Buddha's eye, I think eternal time is nothing but the moment. So from this point, I think it is possible for us to to see the some devas, somebody, who participated in that ceremony, and they exist in this world. Well, practically speaking, I think that spirit of the Buddha transmitted to Mahakasyapa, has been existent from the ancient time to up to now, transmitted from one to another, from one ancestor to another ancestor. 

So very naturally, Mahakasyapa knows what the significance of the Buddha's teaching is, and then Ananda anyway became becomes successor of the Mahakasyapa, who knows exactly significance of Buddha's teaching. So from generation to generation, each ancestor accepted, received true significance of the Buddha's teaching. So from this point, I think, still we know. Even [in the] 21st century, I think somebody knows. Somebody knows what what the true significance of Buddha's teaching is. 

So that is the, well, I think we can participate. It is called, we can prove that ceremony is really true, saying from the depth of spiritual life. So very naturally.

So from this point I think our practice should be protected, or watched over, by many devas, many guardians, and many sentient beings. Otherwise you cannot continue to practice. 

So that's why Dogen Zenji [says] here, “Some among the deva multitude now present in the heavens actually witnessed the ceremony. Therefore there is no reason for any doubt. The Buddha Dharma as a matter of course is forever protected and maintained by the deva multitude. Their efforts never slacken.” So constantly we are anyway protected, maintained, our practice is protected, maintained by many sentient beings, devas, et cetera. That's why we can continue to practice from generation to generation. 

Well, the same applies to everyday life, you know. Your life is still going because your life is protected, maintained by many beings. Historically, or presently, right now or in the future, many beings try to protect your life and maintain. Without this, you cannot live in this world now. 

So, very naturally, if you want to transmit your life, how sublime it is, I think you have to see your life not separate from other beings, but your life regarded as integrated spirit of the universe. And then, you can transmit your life, how sublime, how respectful your life is. Then you can transmit it to the next generations.

It is not a matter of discussion intellectually, but it is matter of practice, taking care of it, dealing with your life as a whole spirit of the universe. And then, you really transmit you your life to the next generations.

So very naturally, Dogen Zenji mentions in the beginning of Bendowa, I think he mentions the key point of zazen we are practicing. The first paragraph, Dogen Zenji mentions, “Buddha Tathagatas all have a wondrous means which is unexcelled and free from human agency for transmitting the wondrous Dharma from one to another without alteration, and realizing supreme and complete awakening. That it is only transmitted without deviation from Buddha to Buddha is due to the *jijiyu samadhi* which is its touchstone.” 


Jijuyû samadhi (jijuyû sammai 自受用三昧) signifies a state of samadhi in which an awakened
one “receives” (ju) and “employs” (yû) the joy of awakening “in himself ” (ji). (Shakyamuni, follow-
ing his attainment, is said to have been self-immersed in the joy of enlightenment.) 


So the zazen we do is based on *jijiyu samadhi*. I think the explanation here, 

Jijuyû samadhi (jijuyû sammai 自受用三昧) signifies a state of samadhi in which an awakened
one “receives” (ju) and “employs” (yû) the joy of awakening “in himself ” (ji). (Shakyamuni, follow-
ing his attainment, is said to have been self-immersed in the joy of enlightenment.) 

> *Jijiyu* means that the awakened one “receives” (*ju*) and “uses” (*yu*) the joy of awakening “in himself” (*ji*). *Jijiyu samadhi* (自受用三昧) thus refers to the samadhi in which this is realized and sustained. It is said Shakyamuni was immersed in the joy of enlightenment following his attainment. 

I think the Jijiyu samadhi, literally *ji* is the self, okay? *Ju* is to receive, and *yu* of jijiyu is to use. And samadhi is samadhi. So from this point, I think the jijiyu samadhi means ... the self receives the self and gives life to it, and ... settles in the self. That is samadhi. Samadhi is “settles the self in the self.” Samadhi is to dwell in dharma. To dwell in the truth, to dwell in the universe, this is samadhi, we say concentration. The samadhi is to dwell in to dwell in the dharma, dwell in the truth, dwell in the true state of existence. 

So jijiyu samadhi is the self becomes the self, gives life to it, and settles in the self. That is jijiyu samadhi. 

One of the most famous Zen teachers in Japan, Sawaki Roshi, mentions a very simple term, he says zazen is that the self becomes self is selfing. Okay? And settles in the self. He says the self becomes the self is selfing. “Is selfing”means giving life to the self. That self is not something dead, so it's always alive, that is [called] “to use.” So the self becomes the self is selfing, and settles in itself. That is zazen, he [says].

So when you do zazen, you become you and you youing. and settle in you, exactly. So that you is not the idea of the you who feels or who experience something before your feeling, before your experience. Okay? Which means, exactly oneness between the zazen and you. And then after oneness, you can say “I feel” or “I experience.” But before this one, before the very first moment of jumping into zazen, and then you say, “Ah. Zazen.” That is already feeling or experience, but that is not *real* self because that self is very shaky, because it's very easily distracted by feeling and experience. 

So that is the *jijiyu samadhi*. 

Obaku Zen master asked Nansen, “If dhyana and wisdom are equated you can see into the Buddha nature. How is it? Can you tell me about this teaching?” And then Nansen said, “I have nothing to depend on for 24 hours.” Well, it means dhyana and wisdom, including sila, okay? If dhyana and wisdom are equated, used equally by practicer, and then we can see into the Buddha nature. How about this principle, this teaching? And then he says, “I have nothing to depends on for 24 hours.” But this is still a little bit the dualistic world, because there are persons who don't depend on anything for 24 hours, and also there are the dhyana and wisdom, which are not depended by anybody, by him. And also there are hours, time, so-called 24 hours, during which he never depend on anything. So still dualistic, okay? If I say I don't depend, “I have nothing to depend on,” immediately the person who doesn't depend on anything is here, and also simultaneously I have something I don't depend on. So very dualistic. And simultaneously, there is a time, you know, for certain a period of time, I don't depend on. And also a place, which lets that the things exist. So lots of dualistic things there. 

*[Tape change.]*

... to see the Buddha nature is to maintain equally dhyana and wisdom. So to see Buddha, to see into the Buddha nature, buddha-nature means that your life must be alive as a whole, vividly. Which means, according to the Dogon's term it is called jijiyu samadhi. Jijiyu samadhi is that the self becomes the self and gives life to it and settles in the self. That means the self must be really alive, vividly, in zazen, before any separation between. So that means zazen is exactly something like a leaping fish, always working. So self is also working together vividly. So to see into Buddha nature means, you have to deal with your zazen, you have to deal with your mind and body, which are both working, alive, vividly. 

So it is how do we work. So it is just like if you sit down [in] zazen, I think you can see the mind, you can see the distractions, because the mind is pretty easily distracted by continuous change, by the events which are changing constantly. But a basic nature of the change, constant change, is not something distracting you, because everything, original nature of change means nothing to attach, nothing to hold. Because if I say, “Ah.” This is ah, the event, some event. That nature of ah sound or events is nothing. No root. So that's why in a moment event occurs, in the next moment it disappears. But according to human consciousness, immediately pick up that form of event, and then attach to it. But basically, it's always moving, so you cannot grasp it, so very naturally consciousness feels sad, or pensive, or melancholy. Or despair. Or pretty pensive, because unsatisfactory, very naturally. And then, if we say all sentient beings are impermanent, so we don't like impermanence. But impermanence means constant change. Constant change is not pessimistic. You have to understand the impermanence, you have to see into the true meaning of impermanence and constant change pretty deeply. So original nature of the constant change is completely transparent. So nothing to feel. So very naturally, what you have to do is, in whatever situation, in whatever time, or in whatever moment, in whatever event, all we have to do is just face and deal with, and go. 

So consciousness – how do we take care of consciousness, which seems to be easily distracted by events which are changing constantly? That means, the koan mentions, just like a baby's mind, like us throw away the ball into the stream of swift river. So as soon as possible you have to deal with zazen, and breathing, and the mind. And then, you have to go. But when you see the mind and the breathing which are distracted by the constant change, immediately you try to stay or judge, critical toward it, or stay with it, always, so very naturally, mind always stays in the stream. But actually you cannot. So that's why finally we are very confused.

So *jijiyu samadhi* is exactly you have to live vividly from moment to moment. Zazen is a very simple circumstances, and you can really see closely and deeply what happens in the mind and your body. So all you can do is deal with them as simply as you can, because circumstances, your body, your mind, are very present under very good situations. So that's why zazen is most important thing. So Zazen is not the same as *dhyana* of the three main learnings, et cetera, because you have to deal with your life as a whole. And if you do zazen, you can see the integrated spirit of the Buddha’s teaching, or integrated spirit of your life, interconnected, interpenetrated with all universe. This is the reality you live in.

So, you need very naturally wisdom in zazen, because wisdom is... not knowledge, wisdom is ... resolution, or steadfast determination, coming from the depth of your heart. “I will do.” Okay? This is wisdom. Wisdom anyway cuts off entanglement around some event. If you face with it. Lots of entanglements there, and then wisdom cuts off those entanglements. And then immediately, “I will do.” That is wisdom. But an understanding, knowledge is always analyzing, try to understand what the entanglements are, and how can we cut off that stuff, and using the technique. That is knowledge. But wisdom is exactly cut off, right now. “Yes, sir. I will do it.” So this is wisdom. Okay? So very naturally, in zazen you need wisdom.

And also we need the precepts or means of [...] disciplines. When you do zazen, very naturally there are lots of procedures you have to go through. Postures, and breathing, and also your mind, and circumstances, and meals, sleep. There are lots of complicated procedure you have to go through. And then, nevertheless, your body, your mind, shouldn't be distracted. How? You can maintain your mind and maintain your breath in peace and harmony, by your wisdom and dhyana, and sila. Beyond your speculation. This is called jijiyu samadhi. Dogen Zenji mentions, zazen *is* jijiyu samadhi. 

And then we chant Jijiyu Zanmai in the noon service. That is a contents, quality of jijiyu samadhi. What happens in the *jijiyu samadhi* world. So, Dogen Zenji mentions about jijiyu samadhi, what's going on in the world of jijiyu samadhi. It's really amazing. But you don't believe it. But it is just like a musical orchestra. It's just like an orchestra. If you read that Jijiyu Zanmai at the noon service, I think you’re always creating a big orchestra, music. So many beings there, but creating wonderful music world there. So that is contents or quality of jijiyu samadhi, if you do zazen. That's why if you do zazen even for a moment with sincere heart, with wholeheartedness, there is [rewards] exactly, there is a progress there.

So number six, almost the same questions.

> Question 6: Why should Buddhists advocate Zen meditation, relying on sitting alone, among the four attitudes – going, standing, sitting, lying – for entering realization?
>
> Answer 6: It wouldn't be possible to investigate thoroughly the way in which Buddhas one after another from long in the past have practiced and entered realization. If you seek a reason for their having done this, you should know it is simply because it is the way employed by Buddhists. Reasons shouldn't be sought elsewhere. Yet patriarchs have extolled, it saying that zazen in itself is the dharma gate of repose and joy. In truth, is this not because among the four attitudes, sitting is joyful bliss? Indeed, this is not the way of practice of one or two Buddhas, it is the way of all Buddhas and all patriarchs. 

Anyway, from generation to generation, all Buddhas, all ancestors, have practiced this zazen, *jijiyu zanmai*, *samadhi*, and transmitted it from generation to generation. So there is no space to poke our head [into] why they did, because it is a fact, it is reality. Because zazen is to experience straightforwardly repose and bliss, right in the middle of zazen. “Repose and bliss” means you have to become you have to become you as you are exactly, and you are *you-ing*. Okay? *You are you-ing* is there is nothing to deal with, or, you are not carried away by anything. Or, you don't carry away anything. So exactly *you are youing* means you *do*, exactly. So you become what you are, and you are youing, and that means you settle yourself in the self, including the whole universe. At that time, you can really settle in the self. That is called repose and bliss. 

That is completely beyond: before you think, before you feel, before you experience. But we are always hanging around the experience or feeling. Always we [say], “how do you feel? Do you like it?” or “How are you feeling? You don't like it?” Well, what kind of experience you did. So we are always talking about this one. That is important, but the most important point is you have to see into deeply that Buddha nature. Buddha nature means before you feel, you experience, put yourself in buddha-nature's world. And then, many worlds coming up. That is nothing but activity in dynamism, from moment to moment. Just like a throwing away the ball into the stream of swift waters, constantly. That is what? It's not an idea, it's not a matter of discussion. You have to do it. It's really total activities. It's peace, which is peace and also dynamism. 

So zazen is exactly experience this one, so if you do zazen, that sitting is not separate from walking and standing and sleeping. It's exactly the same as, including all. Because before [...] prior to have idea of the four activities, so-called sleeping, sitting, et cetera, that is you have to put yourself in buddha-nature's world. But the idea of the four activities – sitting and sleeping, et cetera – is the idea of the conceptual world. So that is many feelings coming up, many experiences coming up. 

So that's why here it says, no particular reason why we we shouldn't have zazen exactly. So here it says, yet patriarchs have extolled it, saying that zazen in itself is the dharma gate of repose and joy. This is the essential art of zazen. 

Do you have a question about this? 

#### 1:01:51

**Question:** Hojo-san?

**Katagiri Roshi:** *Hai*.

**Questioner:** Why is *jijiyu samadhi* referred to as Self-Enjoyment Samadhi? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** I don't know how to say, it's pretty difficult to translate it, but joy itself, joyfulness means exactly in whatever situation you may be, whatever time you may be, in whatever events may occur, anyway you must [be] host of yourself, you must you must be master of yourself. 

So that means what? It is not something you can get from outside. So it is in you. And then from that, you can really feel a kind of joy. But it is not exactly joy, but something [like] joy. So that's why it says self-joyfulness. 

But literally, I think [what] I mentioned already, it's better than “self-joyfulness.” For me. *[He chuckles slightly.]*

#### 1:03:28

**Question:** Hojo-san? But then there's got to be some way of appreciating that. They always say, it's happening beyond your perceptions, beyond your comprehension, beyond your experience. But if all my experience is telling me my body is sitting there in pain in zazen, then reality to me is the pain. And if this at some higher level or whatever this is happening, and once there’s some way of appreciating that, then of what... I mean, if you don't know you're in that state, then you aren’t benefiting from it. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** It's not a “higher level.” Beyond your experience is not something higher level, separate from you, from reality, you know. Because you are already there, otherwise you cannot experience *anything*. So before experience, “you have to settle in the self prior to feeling or experience” doesn't mean to ignore the reality from what you feel – pain, et cetera. The point is how do you deal with that reality. Do you want to stay with the reality with torment, you know, for long? Or do you want to deal with reality as simply, straightforwardly, just like water running. So deal with it; leave it. That kind of thing. Different world coming up. Is that clear? 

For instance, I’m sitting here, and then feel the pain. And then the trouble is that we always stay with the pain which occurs through our experience. And then we are attach to experience, and stay with it, and adding the psychological ... trouble, psychological stuff to it. “I hate it!” That is effective preferences. Always, [your] psychological affections, you add to it. That's why it's very difficult to leave there. See the pain, and then you add the psychological problem to it. So very difficult to leave as soon as possible. So that because emotional the activity is very sticky, very sticky. 

So as [least] as you can, you have to deal with the pain, and deal with it take taking care of it, and leave. That is most important for us. So it's not necessary to ignore – you cannot ignore reality. The question is, how much you stay with it, how quick you can pass by. 

That is activity. Your practice. 

**Questioner:** Hojo-san, what about our conditioning, though? Like I've heard some people say, “Just let go,” just like it's a real easy thing to do, when actually all your conditioning of conventional reality is overwhelming. How do you “just let go”?

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yes, well they may be overwhelming, it depends. Feeling of overwhelming is completely different from an individual. For instance, sitting like this is overwhelming, somebody feels “that's overwhelming,” you know, “that's pretty hard.” But someone says “it's all right, pretty easy, just sitting,” you know? So what do you mean overwhelming? It's different from a different person. Evaluation is different.

So overwhelming is fine, if you think, but it is not exactly overwhelming. That's why if you think it's overwhelming, fine, but still there is the opportunity to take a deep breath from overwhelming. So let it go. 

But if you think it's overwhelming, immediately you are bogged down with the idea of overwhelming. So that's why it's very difficult to be free from it.

#### 1:09:03

**Question:** Is *jijiyu samadhi* at different state from, for example, shikantaza?

**Katagiri Roshi:** Same.

**Questioner:** Same?

**Katagiri Roshi:** Same. But *jijiyu samadhi* is the *contents* of shikantaza. If you do shikantaza, very naturally shikantaza is presented as presented as *jijiyu samadhi*. That is the quality of shikantaza. 

**Questioner:** And then *jijiyu samadhi*, is it different than Ocean Seal Samadhi? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Ocean Seal Samadhi – that is a different term. Ocean Seal Samadhi is a little bit more philosophical, according to *Avatamsaka Sutra*, explaining how the world is existent, and how the world is structured, and reflecting and interpenetrated, interconnected. That is the Ocean Seal Samadhi. So everything becomes already in the Ocean Seal Samadhi, we can say. Ocean Seal Samadhi means all sentient beings – trees, birds, winters, clouds and the skies – all are interpenetrated, under the illumination of Vairochana Buddha. 

So from this point, already the trees is what it ought to be, and the winter is what it ought to be. So, no space to discuss, you know, “I like” or “I don't like.” Winter is winter. And the trees are trees. Snow is snow. Like this. That [is the meaning of] Ocean Seal Samadhi.

**Questioner:** So you can experience that and be experiencing *jijiyu samadhi* at the same time? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Mm-hmm. Well, actually, we have to experience. We have to experience means we have to taste that Ocean Seal Samadhi in zazen. Okay? And then it is called *jijiyu samadhi*. 

#### 1:11:57

**Question:** I was trying to phrase another question, and it has to do with letting go into into this other state, which, if that's supposed to be perfect peace, then it seems like that shouldn't be experienced as threat or anxiety. Peace, it should be self-evident that that's peace. But say if you're trying to let go, say if your body is sitting in zazen and pain, and you're trying to let go of that, but that letting go is perceived as threat and anxiety, then that's not peace. I mean it seems like that the samadhi state should be self-evident if it's there. And I'm not sure if I'm phrasing it exactly the way I want to.

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yeah, you are talking about almost the same as I mentioned the Obaku Zen Master asking questions and to Nansen. Do you understand? Obaku Zen Master says, if the wisdom and samadhi is equated, you can see into the Buddha nature – how about this teaching? And then Nansen says, “I have nothing to depend on for [24] hours.” But I mentioned about this one, well, what do you mean “I have nothing to depend on”? Because nothing to depend on means to try to reach a higher level of existence? Beyond reality, beyond the feeling or experience? So that is nothing to depend on for [24] hours, but that means it is already we are juggling 24 hours I have been not depending on – this is a time already. And also, there is a person who has been not depending on anything, so here is a person. And also the particular things I don't depend for 24 hours. So already three: person, and things, and also time. And also place, and also many conditions elements there. So finally we are playing juggling with this. 

So finally, what do you mean not to depend on anything for 24 hours? You constantly have to discuss. But a question is, “zazen is a dharma gate of repose and bliss” means if you sit down, please sit down. Well, empty your head. Please sit down right now, in peace and harmony. That *is* simultaneously repose and bliss. Before you think. 

But immediately consciousness pokes you head, and then, it's not peace, it’s not repose and bliss, already. So, where is the higher level, before you think or you feel or you experience? Where is it? It's activity: please, sit down, right now, in peace. That's it. That is dealing your life as a whole, so-called *integrated* spirit of your life as the universe, with the universe. So that is not just activity there. 

Is that clear? 

No?

**Someone:** Excuse me, Hojo-san? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Excuse me. Is that alright? The point I mentioned? Do you understand what I mentioned? You’re always juggling.

**Questioner:** Yeah.

**Katagiri Roshi:** Here is a higher level of experience spiritual life. Before you feel, and it's already separated.

**Questioner:** It's just the point I'm making is like, we can create so much struggle, and it just seems like if there's struggle here and there's peace here, it would be perfectly natural to choose peace, so why do always I choose struggle, and yet people seem to cling to the struggle side rather than the peace side. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Because you think peace doesn't exist in the struggling. But, where is the peace? Right in the middle of struggling, there is still opportunity to have peace. 

**Questioner:** If you can see that, yeah.

**Katagiri Roshi:** No, you can do it. For instance, I said, struggling, the sitting here. Now I feel pain, okay? And then I struggle with sitting zazen now, and then I feel pain pain pain pain... just that is struggling for me. Where is the peace? No peace, you know? But please, stop it. *[He laughs.]* Even for a moment, sit down, please. Take a deep breath, and forget it, and sit. Even for a moment. There is peace.

So right in the middle of struggling there is peace means, what do you mean peace? Stop it. “Stop it” means please sit down right now. Put it aside, all, you know, ideas, and entanglements, et cetera, many things – put it aside, and please sit down right now. There is peace. 

So peace is not something different from struggling you do. Is that okay? 

**Questioner:** Well, I think I understand the point you’re trying to make, but I don't think that I can see that for myself.

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yes. So from now, you should taste it. Okay? If you understand it, you have to taste it. Even for a moment you can do it.

So you do always, and [...] the lots of stuff coming up in your head, and then finally you completely [say,] “Aw, forget it,” and close your eyes, and take a deep breath, and stand up quietly. That's it. Or you say, “I want to go to nature, which is a quiet place.” So you can do it. Or, on the street, you know, noise coming up and the people scream at you... and then, how do you keep the peace, you know? Just take a breath. Return to yourself, and just walk. *[He chuckles.]* You [can’t] meddle with those complicated [things] on the street. 

So if you understand even intellectually, next you have to taste it. 

Any other [questions]? 

#### 1:20:15

**Question:** If we taste it, why do we forget it?

**Katagiri Roshi:** If you taste it, naturally you can forget it. 

*[Some chuckles.]*

“Forget” means forget the distracted state of mind. Forget that stuff.

**Someone:** I don’t think that’s quite what you meant, is it?

**Katagiri Roshi:** Is that what you mean?

**Questioner:** Um, I don’t hear the answer... If you sense what it is to let go, how come in another situation, you don’t even recall that you had that sense in this situation?

**Katagiri Roshi:** Mm, I don’t understand. Would you say it again?

**Questioner:** If you see something, if you recognize the self, why do you lose it?

**Katagiri Roshi:** Is that something wrong with it? “Lost it” means... It’s not lose. “Forget” doesn’t mean losing completely. 

What do you mean... for instance, if you taste this situation, you mean why the rest of things should be forgotten? 

**Questioner:** I’m like trying to hold on it?

**Someone:** I think he’s more saying, why do we forget our samadhi place? Why do we forget that peaceful zazen place, when we are off in our day to day life, and we chase after other kinds of solutions, and we don’t take the backward step, to zazen. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Oh, oh, I see.  Well I think one [reason] is that human beings have been tamed for many, many years to deal with human life and circumstances just like that, by our consciousness. By our customs, and education – in a dualistic way, always deal with in that way. So we are always dealing with the world *after*, after created, you know, we deal with the world created by the consciousness. Not before. We always forget. We have forgotten already. But we are carried, we have carried on on our back already. Not back; as a whole personality, anyway. We have already. But we don't pay attention to it. So we always pay attention to the world created by consciousness, that means the world of conceptualizations. Okay? 

So for many, many years, we have been tamed, by education, and customs, and habits, like this. So it's pretty hard. We have almost forgotten this original first stage of the world. So that's why we have to come back. That is our practice, spiritual practice. Is that okay? 

**Questioner:** Yeah.

#### 1:25:09

**Question:** Roshi? So, it seems like in your presentation, the discussion seems to be talking about integrated activity versus conceptualization. We won't talk about dhyana separated, but you describe the activity of zazen... but I don't hear you saying anything that makes the activity of zazen different than the activity of bowing, different than the activity of walking, or chanting. I don't hear you explain why we only do zazen.

**Katagiri Roshi:** And that’s why zazen is a *form* of zazen. If you see the zazen in terms of form, there are many forms, there are many other forms opposed to zazen forms. But the *jijiyu samadhi* is the *contents* of that form of zazen or quality of zazen. That is called activity, very undefiled activities. That is a point Dogen Zenji talks about. And then, if you do zazen like this, very naturally you can touch the quality of zazen, regarded as a form. So that quality is universal. Even though you walk, and you sit, and you stand, I think there is. That is very universal. And then from that universal state, I think according to the conditional situation, it appears as a certain form – sometimes standing, sometimes walking, something like that. But I think there are many forms, but they must be supported by something more than form. That is called undefiled activity, or practice. So-called emptiness, we say – “Form is emptiness, emptiness is form,” in *Prajnaparamita* [*Sutra*]. 

So if you see the world in terms of the form, there are many different, because each form has different characteristics. So sitting is sitting...

*[Tape change.]*

... how do you give a quality to form of standing when you do it? That is most important. So that is, you have to give a quality to form of standing, so-called *jijiyu samadhi*. That's it. And then, at that time, standing is exact spirit of zazen. 

So from this point zazen, standing, same thing. But according to the form, they are different. So you cannot mix them up. So you have to deal with standing as standing.

**Questioner:** So, but it sounds to me still like we’re obsessed with the form of sitting. You know? Instead of samadhi, we’re obsessed with the form of sitting.

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yes, so form of sitting, because the form of sitting is a pretty simple form, and also circumstances are simple. So that's why circumstances, and also physically and mentally, and time and place, and many things, we try to make adjustment of all things, and then sit down. So that's why sitting is very simple form.

**Questioner:** Some people think kinhin or bowing is more simple.

**Katagiri Roshi:** Well, in this kind of sitting, you know circumstances, bowing and standing is of course simple practice. But sitting is exactly inside of inside of the organs, inside of your body, and breathing, all are working together. But if you deal with bowing, I think you have to bow in certain activities, standing. It’s not still, apparently. So quite different. But sitting is completely quiet, but in the realm of stillness, you can see lots of activities there. So very naturally, sitting is pretty particular form, from which we can see many things, more than other forms. So that's why sitting is handed down from generation to generation.

**Someone:** Roshi? What about someone who can’t sit – who is paralyzed, and can only lie down?

**Katagiri Roshi:** Lie down is fine. Lie down, and sitting on the chair. 

**Questioner:** What you just said, you could say the same thing for bowing, or chanting. That form has its own special characteristic, which makes it unique, even though the activity is common.

**Katagiri Roshi:** I think through the zazen form I think you have to taste that *jijiyu samadhi* exactly. And then, it's really standing and walking, you can make the standing form the walking form really alive. You have appreciated. So that's why we do.

It's penetrated into all other forms. For instance, if you experience samadhi from the form of skiing, of course it is, but you can experience the same samadhi. But it's pretty hard to extend it into every other form. We understand it, but everyday life is very complicated. So I think that's why the *jijiyu samadhi* which you can experience through sitting meditation is very valuable and [respected], handed down from generation to generation.

**Questioner:** I don’t question the value, I just question why is it overemphasized, that form. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** It's not “over emphasized.” *[He laughs, and the group laughs.]* Not overemphasized. If you don't like it, you can do anything. 

That's why we say, if you want to go ski, you can go ski. If you want to be a sportsman, you can be a sportsman. And then through the sport, you can learn the samadhi. So why don't you go there. You know?

But we are talking about integrate the spirit of whole world. Okay? Not only the particular area, so-called *sports*, or *art*, et cetera. But we don't ignore. But we are always talking about integrating the spirit of the whole universe, anyway, your life as the whole universe. And then at that time, how do you see this? Finally, you have to sit down. 

In other words – if you don't believe this one – I am not over emphasizing how important zazen form is, but even though you don't have any idea of zazen, or standing, et cetera, but if you drive yourself to a completely corner where you can't move an inch. That means dead end, okay? What do you do? People naturally sit down. People don't run. People don't walk. Finally, sit down. That's it. That is a form you can see right in the middle of a dead end [in] which you cannot move. That's natural. 

And then from that sitting, then they can feel many things. That is a dead end, but simultaneously still they feel the beginning of the world. So still they feel something. 

And also, he himself. He can taste he himself.

So for instance, after the second world war, the war prisoner. While in a prison camp in Japan or elsewhere, and then Aitken Roshi was very impressed by the Japanese prisoners who sat in zazen in a jail. *[He laughs.]* Most of the Japanese prisoners, anyway, sat in jail. Because there is nothing to do, and no help for them, and no hope, but still they have hope, et cetera. But nothing to do. Where should they go? They don't know. Confused? No, it's not, more than confusion. Is it happy? No, something more than happy. Unhappy? Something more than unhappiness. So, nothing to do there. That is really a dead end, and then, they can sit. And then that sitting really gives some suggestions to others. So Aitken Roshi was really impressed by those people who sat, but they didn't say anything about. 

So that is natural. Particularly when you have to see, you know, the core of the whole universe, and how the universe is structured, how the universe is working together with all sentient beings. How do you know that? It's pretty hard. But still you can participate, so pretty close, that's why through the sports through the arts, still artists try to express that beauty of the universe through their form. So still opportunity for them to come near, to tasting the integrated spirit of human life as the universe. 

Okay? *[Someone laughs.]*

You are lucky, anyway. 

**Questioner:** Yeah?

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yeah. Because still you can you can have lots of taste, looking around, and talking about about zazen, talking about standing, talking about sitting. *[He laughs.]* You are lucky, but I don't know how much you are lucky. Lucky is always not lucky, you know? It is cause of confusion.

But in a sense we are lucky, because lots of choices. To looking around... to “go shopping.” But human life is sometimes you have to, human life must be seen from... the emergency case? Where, no choice. And then, you can really see it.

But still, anyway, we have to respect the individual life in their own characteristics. Okay? Personality, and capacities. And then, if you want to go somewhere to do something as a sportsman, as a mountain climber, of course we can encourage them to do this.
