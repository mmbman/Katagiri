Case Thirty-Eight: “Feng Hsueh’s Workings of the Iron Ox”. Pointer:

> If we discuss the gradual, it is going against the ordinary to merge with the Way: in the midst of a bustling market place, seven ways up and down and eight ways across.  
> If we discuss the sudden, it doesn’t leave a hint of a trace; a thousand sages cannot find it.  
> If, on the other hand, we do not set up sudden or gradual, then what? To a quick person, one word; to a quick horse, one blow of the whip. At such a time, who is the master? As a test, I cite this to see.

“If we discuss the gradual”: Here are two points: to discuss the gradual; second, to discuss the sudden. If you discuss the gradual – gradual means gradual progress, seeing progress through your individual feeling, understanding, and experience in your daily life. So that is gradual. 

“If we discuss the gradual, it is going against the ordinary to merge with the Way”: It is going against the ordinary because, ordinary means you are always a little bit away from the point, the truth that you believe to. The point away from the point of the truth. Physically and mentally, in your daily life, your body and mind are present in daily living, that means being present right in the midst of the bustling marketplace. The bustling marketplace means making noise, anyway. Day to day, getting up in the morning: “Yes, I am getting up in the morning.” And then next you don’t want to get up in the morning, so “I don’t want to get up in the morning.” So always bustling, your body and mind is just ... in the bustling marketplace. So, pretty noisy.

And that means, next it says, “seven ways up and down and eight ways across” means ... we don’t care about numbers. Seven ways up and down means countless number, many times, even for a moment, how often do you go up and down, you know? Can you imagine? *[He chuckles.]* If you do that then you can see. In a moment your mind is really going up and down. And next, your mind is really crossing rivers and not cross the small river, you cross the universe. You can go to heaven. You can go to heaven, you can go to Japan, and immediately you can go. So in a moment you are really going up and down, across the universe, et cetera, going to heaven and hell, et cetera. Because you are discussing gradual, gradual progress. Because I am not a good person, I am not a real Buddhist, I am not mature exactly, that’s why I’m afraid to just be present with confidence, that’s why I want to progress. “I want to progress” means you are not mature, you are not perfect now, that’s why very naturally you are discussing about you, right in the middle of the bustling marketplace. That means a little bit pretty hard. If you always take care of your life that way, it’s really painful. 

You cannot take care of your life just like this always. So next, we have to discuss the sudden. Sudden life, sudden progress. One hundred percent perfect. We have to discuss that sudden means one hundred percept perfect. For instance, if you perform athletics, you have to catch the iron bar. If you discuss the gradual, you are always looking at the bar, and looking at you, and then looking at the result which will come, and also you discuss about the audience, and you discuss about the points. You are always doing that. So very naturally you are very uneasy and restless. On the other hand, you have to completely discuss the sudden, means one hundred percept perfect, means you jump [and] grasp it. Ninety percent, you cannot reach ninety percent. If you reach ninety percept to the iron bar, it’s not perfect, don’t you think? Ninety percent is pretty good, but it doesn’t make sense. So you have to completely perfectly catch it. If you catch it then the next moment immediately you can perform athletics. 

“You discuss sudden” means you should catch the iron bar perfectly, one hundred percent. So that is not only athletics: your study, your zazen, your daily living. So we need both. You cannot always say “I can get one hundred points,” you know? You cannot boast [about] yourself like this. But a Zen Master in Japan says, “Zen is always to get zero points or one hundred points.” No middle between. This is Zen. Zen teaching doesn’t mean dogmatic teaching – this is life. I told you athletic performance. One hundred percent, or if you can’t ninety percent, ninety percent is exactly zero points, same thing. So no middle. Zero or one hundred percent. So you feel good. Same applies to zazen too: one hundred percent or zero. That’s what shikantaza is: to get the hundred points. It is very important. Discussing about you in the midst of the bustling marketplace, but on the other hand, you can do it! You have to do it. Otherwise, you cannot see any progress in the bustling marketplace. So we need both simultaneously. 

You know the famous haiku, the old pond, the frog jumps, pop. This is pretty interesting short poem. If you discuss the gradual aspect, I think you can discuss about Basho and you can discuss about the frog, you can discuss about the old pond and mountains and quietness, and men and also singing et cetera; you can discuss both, gradually. But no matter how long you discuss about this and then put all things together pretty good, but I don’t know if you can make this kind of poem. You cannot make such a wonderful poem through the discussion about the gradual – analyzing, synthesizing, and your feeling and also your emotions and psychological point of view, and the original nature of existence, et cetera. You cannot make a perfect nice poem. So important point is next you have to discuss the sudden. That means frog and Basho and old pond, quietness, come together, all of a sudden, as one hundred percent perfect beings. At that time, Basho, frog, and the old pond, and singing songs, quietness, are all put together. In the realm of the sudden, they exist like this. And then, if you discuss this, then a poem comes up. And this poem in a word is not the word coming from discussion of the sudden or discussion of the gradual. 

Then next it says, “If, on the other hand, we do not set up sudden or gradual, then what?” Gradual or sudden [are] still discussion, nothing but discussion. So what do you mean? If you discuss the sudden, that sudden is not the sudden opposed to gradual because discussing sudden means you must be alive in the same way as the frog, or pond, quietness, universe. Anyway you have to exist like this, exactly. If so, what is this? They all become one. So its discussion; it’s nothing but the motion of function of energy. 

Finally you cannot say what this is. This is the sudden; sudden means in the real of the sudden, all things, frogs, ponds, quietness and noise of the water, exist in peace and harmony. This is still a discussion? No. Opposed to gradual. That’s why next it says, “If, on the other hand, we do not set up sudden or gradual” If you pay attention to real reality which which is fully alive in your daily living with all sentient beings, at that time we do not set up sudden or gradual. And “then what?” 

One of the old students at Zen Center in San Francisco, they visited here, and on the way to ... in Vermont. He stayed for a while and discussed for me about Buddhism. He liked very much about Buddhist teaching philosophically, and was always discussing. At that time he wore very nice suits, was [very much a] gentleman. So he said, “Buddhism is interesting,” so I discussed with him about emptiness and interdependent co-origination. And then he said, “Good! That’s a good explanation of emptiness.” And he said, “Then what?” Then what? Exactly: then what? Then what is then what. No room to discuss. So “then what” means pointing out the real aspect of emptiness which is fully alive in your daily living, that is nothing to discuss. That’s why we say, “Then what?” We don’t know what it is. But it’s actually any words full aliveness of the words from the nature of the poem comes from, then what does it come from? Before you set out gradual or sudden. We cannot set up before that. So that’s why here it says, “If, on the other hand, we do not set up sudden or gradual, then what?”

> To a quick person, one word; to a quick horse, one blow of the whip.

“To a quick person, one word”: At that time, one word come from that “then what?” From “then what” means fully alive, nothing to pin down. That’s why we say our head is always catching up with something, but you cannot catch up, because full aliveness is always going. Your intellectual sense cannot catch up. That’s why always I told you it seems to me that grasp that back of your bald head. You cannot grasp bald head because no hairs. *[He chuckles.]* So it’s just we’re always doing like that. 

That’s why “To a quick person, one word” is when you are exactly being present in the real function of emptiness and before you set up gradual or sudden. And then you can really get the aliveness of the words, expressing oneness. So-called old pond. A frog jumps into. Pop. That’s all. From these words, very quick persons, Basho as a person, not being opposed to frog and old pond, is exactly the same as the frog and the old pond. That’s why same guy commented to this poem: “An old pond, Basho jumps in, the sound of water.” You know? Basho jumps into the pond: pop. Same guy comments this. In the notes he said, “If there is a pond with a jump, I want him to hear it.” Do you understand? If there is a pond with a jump I want him to hear it means a huge pond, it’s not a limited pond your senses can see. Pond is exactly pond like a pond with frog and universe and trees and mountains and quietness, et cetera. So that is a huge pond, so-called Buddha Nature, Buddha’s pond. So if there is a pond with a jump, I want to jump in, I want him to hear it. So I am not different from Basho; I am Basho. That’s why I can understand Basho’s feelings, and now I understand the frog’s life, I understand the tranquility’s life, created by clouds and old pond and mountains, et cetera. So that’s why he said, “If there is a pond, I want to jump, I want him to hear it.” And next he says, “And old pond, something jumps in with a pop.” Something jumps in. What jumps in? I jump in? Or Basho jumps in? Or frog jumps in? Or tranquility jumps in? I don’t know. Something jumps in. It means a very natural situation, something jumps in. Something is completely leaving no trace of frog and old pond and Basho, working together perfectly, one hundred percent, but they don’t leave any trace, so-called “I am merging with all beings perfectly, one hundred percent perfect.” Then don’t. So that’s why same guy says, “Something jumps in, with a pop.” 

This is the explaining what? To quick person, one word, to horse, one blow of the whip. No space to think of it; it immediately comes up.

> At such a time, who is the master? As a test, I cite this to see.

Who is a master? I am a master to make a poem? I am a master in zazen? Who is the master? Zazen is the master? Because zazen educates me, zazen enhances me, so zazen is the master? No. So if it is not, am I the master? No. Well who is the master? Right in the middle of zazen you are merging with each other perfectly, that’s why I told you being on the top of a hundred feet high pole, take one step forward. Who [judges]? Who pushes you to take a step forward? No one. Who [approves] your jumping from the hundred feet high pole? No one. Anyway, jump. Take one step forward; that is a great master. Well, temporarily we can say [so]. 

So take one step forward. Anyway, take one step forward is, maybe, master – without leaving any trace of being master. That’s why we don’t know who is the master. Who gives a reward? I don’t know. 

That’s why “who is the master?” No. 

Lotus Sutra or Dogen Zenji says, Buddha knows. Only Buddha knows what the Buddha is. Only Buddha knows what human suffering is. Only Buddha knows the Buddha’s world.

“As a test, I cite this to see.” Next, the case. 

> At the government headquarters in Ying Chou, Feng Hsueh entered the hall and said, “The Patriarchal Masters’ Mind Seal is formed like the workings of the Iron Ox: when taken away, the impression remains; when left there, then the impression is ruined. But if neither removed nor left there, is sealing right or is not sealing right?”  
> At that time there was a certain Elder Lu P’i who came forth and said, “I have the workings of the Iron Ox: please, Teacher, do not impress the seal.”  
> Hsueh said, “Accustomed to scouring the oceans fishing for whales, I regret to find instead a frog crawling in the muddy sand.”  
> P’i stood there thinking. Hsueh shouted and said, “Elder, why do you not speak further?” P’i hesitated; Hsueh hit him with his whisk. Hsueh said, “Do you still remember the words? Try to quote them.” As P’i was about to open his mouth, Hsueh hit him again with his whisk.  
> The Governor said, “The Buddhist Law and the Law of Kings are the same.”  
> Hsueh said, “What principle have you seen?”  
> The Governor said, “When you do not settle what is to be settled, instead you bring about disorder.”  
> Hsueh thereupon descended from his seat.  
> 
> (From *The Blue Cliff Record*, translated by Thomas Cleary & J.C. Cleary.)


> At the government headquarters in Ying Chou, Feng Hsueh entered the hall

Feng Hsueh Zen Master seemed to be living in maybe the headquarters of the government in China, in Chou, and teaching Buddhism to government people. One day he entered the teaching hall and said, 

> “The Patriarchal Masters’ Mind Seal is formed like the workings of the Iron Ox: ...”

Mind seal means whatever you say... Buddha Nature, or the original nature of existence, or dharma body, dharma nature, or bodhi mind, whatever you say. That is mind seal. 

Regardless of whether you are conscious of it or not, mind seal regarded as a Buddha is already sealed in the root of your life. No exceptions; everyone, all beings are exactly sealed by Buddha Nature. “The Patriarchal Masters” means many patriarchs from generation to generation; mind seal is handed down from generation to generation, from patriarch to patriarch. 

“... formed like the workings of the Iron Ox”: Mind Seal is Buddha Nature, Buddha Mind, bodhi mind, seems to be a wonderful thing, but we *don’t know* what it is. It’s very [vague]. So that’s why it says “the workings of the Iron Ox.” Iron Ox is... so-called Iron Ox, huge iron ox, built by the Yellow River in China. People believed in this Iron Ox, regarded as a protector of the Yellow River. Because the Yellow River is very important thing for Chinese to live there, in many ways. In ancient times it was built by an emperor. Huge, anyway, iron ox. Head is toward [Po-nan], that means toward the south. And the tail is in the north. A *huge*, huge iron ox. Iron ox is anyway something made with iron, so it doesn’t move. It’s huge but it doesn’t move. But every year, annually, Chinese people respect this with celebration and religious ceremony, and respecting this Iron Ox because it is regarded as a great protector for the Yellow River. From this point the Iron Ox doesn’t move, it is not alive, but it’s alive by the people who respect this, with religious ceremony. 

That’s why Mind Seal is very *vast*; we don’t know what it is. It seems to be far away from us. “You are Buddha Nature” – how do you understand this? “Well, yes, you say so. If you say so, I can believe it.” But where is the Buddha Nature. Buddha Nature is Katagiri’s Buddha Nature if you say “if you say so, I can believe,” but it’s not *your* Buddha Nature. So you have to feel and get a taste of Buddha Nature in your heart. So still Buddha Nature and Mind Seal or buddha mind, compassionate and generous, magnanimous human mind is still vague, far from us, because every day we can see the mind which is in bustling marketplace. Seven ways up and down, and seven ways across always. So it’s pretty hard to believe Buddha Mind which is fully alive. But on the other hand Buddha Mind is really Buddha mind, because right in the middle of war, still there is one person always, from generation to generation, who hopes ... toward peace. Right in the middle of natural tragedies or whatever, one seed is left. [Buddha.] 

From this point, we have Buddha mind. Anyway Buddha mind is really alive. If you see small little boys rushing into the street, who is on the verge of life and death, you immediately rush in to save him from the danger, before you discuss “should I or shouldn’t I?” This action really comes from Buddha mind: compassion, generosity, magnanimous mind. 

That’s why it says “The Patriarchal Masters’ Mind Seal is formed like the workings of the Iron Ox”

#### 34:37

> “... when taken away, the impression remains; when left there, then the impression is ruined.”

In this case the seal is a kind of example. You know the Japanese seal or stamp. If a seal is pressed down on a piece of paper and taken away, then the seal is alive, the seal remains. But on the other hand, when the seal is left there, the impression is ruined, because you cannot see the impression. You cannot see the seal, because the seal is on the paper.

That means you don’t understand Buddha mind, but it is already present in everyone. So all you have to do is Buddha nature should be accepted by everyone, without exception. Just like a seal. My name’s on it, so no excuse. If so, well I have a seal, but seal is seal; if you don’t use it, it doesn’t make sense. So seal must be alive in your daily living, so you have to press it down on a paper or clay, or on something anyway. That means hold completely perfect of acceptance of Buddha nature; next moment you have to take it away. That means you should accept Buddha nature, but you cannot say, “I am Buddha, so why is I have to practice zazen?” Your seal is always on the paper; it doesn’t make sense. So you should completely accept; but that is it should be taken away. In order to see the seal of the name, so-called Buddha nature. So that means holding. And then practice, there are two ways: one practice is letting go. The second is holding it. So letting go is completely perfect acceptance of Buddha nature, means you have to put it down, anyway you have to put it into practice everyday, on the paper of the everyday, which is called everyday life. You should put it [there], press down. It should be pressed down every day. But simultaneously it should be taken away. That means you cannot hang on. You know, “I am Buddha.” If you say, “I am Buddha,” very naturally you hang on to the idea of Buddha nature. It doesn’t make sense, because everyday life look at yourself. You cannot see the Buddha, because your body and mind is in the bustling marketplace. 

*[Tape change.]*

So how do you take care of this? This is also a question. If you are Buddha, if you accept one hundred percent you are Buddha nature, anyway put it into practice, press down on the paper every day, while simultaneously it should be taken away. At that time, Buddha nature is there, but intellectually you cannot perceive it. This is a little problem. But if you do it, very naturally you can see it, you can feel it. According to discussion of gradual, very naturally you can see it. 

And then “holding”: holding means you should hold Buddha nature but holding doesn’t mean hang on, okay? If you receive the Buddha nature, always staying there, dwelling in Buddha nature, but that means letting go, simultaneously you should cut off any image of Buddha nature or whatever it is. If you do it, at that time there is something you can hold; that is Buddha nature without leaving any trace of it. No trace. So that is, you can hold it. That something you can hold is pretty hard to be understand [or not] by six senses. 

That’s why it says “when taken away, the impression remains; when left there, then the impression is ruined.” When you hold on constantly, whatever it is, good or bad, if you hold on, it’s ruined. You have to hold on to something, but this is not something you can hold by your six senses. 

#### 41:53

> “But if neither removed nor left there, is sealing right or is not sealing right?”

Well, if you say “when taken away, the impression remains; when left there, then the impression is ruined”, but if neither removed nor left there, Why is it we have to say is sealing right or is not sealing right? Because neither removed nor left means completely emptiness. Should I say removing is right? Or leaving there is not right? We cannot say so, because we need both. When you let go of Buddha nature you have understood, at that time something remains which you can hold. But I don’t know what it is. This is Buddha nature. 

So in order to hold, you have to let go. So we need both practices simultaneously. Constantly we have to do this practice. When you do zazen, completely you should accept zazen, beyond your senses, your understanding, and buddha nature. You should accept zazen. But zazen lets you become Buddha. Yes it does. But, you have to let go of this idea. And then, there is something you can hold, which maybe you can discuss “gradually,” in the midst of the bustling marketplace. You can see ... there. But we don’t know what it is, because when you see it, next moment it is also in the midst of the bustling marketplace. But all we have to do is when we do zazen, just accept and let it go. And then, there is something you can hold. But this hold doesn’t mean hanging on. 

So that’s why 

*[Tape change]*

... is right way, or living is the right way. You cannot say. 

#### 45:04

> At that time there was a certain Elder Lu P’i who came forth and said, “I have the workings of the Iron Ox: please, Teacher, do not impress the seal.”

This is Elder Lu P’i who came forth and said, “I have the workings of the Iron Ox.” This statement is exactly imitated.

So he said, “Please, Teacher, do not impress the seal” – because I am already Iron Ox. Iron Ox is... Should I press down the seal? And then simultaneously take it away? Or should I press down the seal and leave it there? Which is right? Which is wrong? Iron Ox by the river, is it dead? Yes, it’s dead; but it’s not dead. It’s alive? It’s not alive; it’s dead because [it’s an] Iron Ox. But is the so-called Iron Ox dead? No. It’s really close relation with human beings, protecting the Yellow River. If so, it’s alive. So which is right? Can we say the Iron Ox is alive? No, it’s wrong. But in a sense, it’s right. Or the Iron Ox is dead... It’s right, but it’s wrong. So finally, nothing to say. 

So, ““I have the workings of the Iron Ox” is I am already present right in the middle of emptiness, without leaving any trace. So please don’t press me. Don’t press the seal down on my life, you are Iron Ox, which is dead, or which is alive. 

#### 47:38

But,

> Hsueh said, “Accustomed to scouring the oceans fishing for whales ...”

Do you understand “fishing for whales”? You know, *big* whales; whales are *huge*. Even a big ocean, if a whale swims, it makes huge waves. It’s fantastic. 

So it’s scouring; [it’s like] clean up everything, stirring up the oceans completely. His statement “I have the workings of the Iron Ox” means just like a whale swimming in the ocean. Pretty nice, you know? He knows pretty well the real point of the Zen teachings. So he says so; so he becomes a whale. He becomes just a whale swimming in the ocean, stirring the waters. ... Scouring or making the water muddy; whatever you say, it’s alright. And that’s why Hsueh said “accustomed”; you are pretty good, accustomed to do so, because you are a pretty big whale. You can swim in the ocean. Not small whale, anyway.

So, pretty good, but:

> “... I regret to find instead a frog crawling in the muddy sand.”  

*[He laughs.]* It means, what you said is exactly right, *exactly* right, but still there is a frog crawling in the muddy sand. That means still there is a trace there. “I am a big whale, swimming in the ocean,” “I am an enlightened person” – like this. Scouring the waters. But still I regret I can see a frog crawling in the muddy sand. Even though you get out from human delusions, you can get out of the house from the door, but unfortunately your tail is [caught] by the door. *[He laughs.]* So you can’t get out. More than half of your body is, but still your tail is hooked by the door. It’s pretty hard to realize this point, so that’s why we need to constantly practice. Letting go, constantly. When you let go, then something is filled in your hand. If you don’t let go, why it’s very hard. So that’s why Hsueh said, “I regret to find instead a frog crawling in the muddy sand.”

#### 51:33

> P’i stood there thinking. 

So P’i couldn’t say anything about this. So a big whale becomes a small frog in the muddy sand. Hsueh saw him exactly like that. But on the other hand, this Lu P’i is really huge whale swimming in the ocean; he seems to be wonderful, but on the other hand, he can see him as a frog in the muddy sand. So, nothing to say; P’i was a little bit confused. So, 

>  Hsueh shouted and said, “Elder, why do you not speak further?” 

Why don’t you say something about this? Is my statement right, or can’t you say [something] about this? 

> P’i hesitated

Still P’i hesitated. Maybe P’i understood what Hsueh said. If you understand, most times it’s pretty hard to say. If you understand the Buddha nature [cats](glossary#cat) have or human beings have, well it’s pretty hard to say, because whatever you say, a cat *doesn’t* have Buddha nature, it’s wrong. Or even though you say a cat *has* Buddha nature, it’s wrong, because where is the Buddha nature [in a cat]? Buddha nature in a cat is exactly like a human being? No it’s not; a little different. Does the cat understand human life very deeply? No. If so, where is the Buddha nature? So whatever you say, it doesn’t hit the mark. So maybe P’i hesitated because he knew. 

> Hsueh hit him with his whisk. Hsueh said, “Do you still remember the words? Try to quote them.” 

“Do you still remember the words which you have said? Do you? You said, ‘I have the workings of the Iron Ox.’ You said so. Can’t you remember that?”

> As P’i was about to open his mouth, Hsueh hit him again with his whisk.  

P’i was trying to open his mouth and trying to say something, but Hsueh immediately hit him again with his whisk.

#### 54:34

> The Governor said, 

At that time there was a Governor by them, listening to this conversation between Hsueh and Lu P’i. This Governor had been practicing for a long time under the guidance of Hsueh Zen Master. So he knows pretty much the real point of Zen teachings, so he said, 

> “The Buddhist Law and the Law of Kings are the same.”  

In a sense, the Governor stood between and passed out their judgement on this case. “Both are pretty good.” That’s why next,

> Hsueh said, “What principle have you seen?”  

If you say both of them are good, you judge like this on this case, if so, what have you seen? What is the truth you have seen?

> The Governor said, “When you do not settle what is to be settled, instead you bring about disorder.”  

That means what you have to do. You shouldn’t do what ... you shouldn’t do it. Life is very simple. When you want to practice, practice. When you attend training sessions, follow the schedule. Even though it’s hard, follow the schedule. So you should do what you have to do. This is daily life, based on Buddha nature. Living in, standing straight in the Buddha nature. Life is very simple: you have to do what you have to do; you shouldn’t do what you shouldn’t do. That’s all you have to do. 

> Hsueh thereupon descended from his seat.  

Then that is the end of the discussion. He descended from his seat means he really accepted that Governor’s way too. 

Next time I want to discuss some of the commentaries and notes. This commentary is a pretty long commentary. Interesting stories there. So you should read it. And also the Verse next time. 

Do you have some questions? 

#### 58:12

**Question**: Hojo-san? The difficulty with the list, is that just sort of like say “just do it”?

**Katagiri**: Yeah, that is “discussing sudden.”

**Same person**: Ah. 

**Katagiri**: This *Blue Cliff Record* always appears the sudden and gradual, particularly sudden, as a dramatic way. Very dramatic, but I don’t think you should imitate the dramatic way. *[He chuckles.]* So in many ways you can do: through the words, through the silence, you can do it.

You know I told you before a Zen Master taught to the priest who were really proud of his experience, his priest life, because he was completely respected by one of his followers. This very old woman completely respected him, just like Buddha, you know? So he told to the Zen Masters, “I was really respected by one of my followers.” Then immediately he said, “Don’t think of life roughly. You originally are stupid. So shut up.” *[He laughs.]* This is in a word, it’s very sharp. Don’t you think so? It means if you are by somebody that’s wonderful, but let it go. What do you mean? You are respected by one of the old women in the village. It is just like karmic life. Just like a lion; lion is strong, catch the cats in the lion cage, and eat. And then you say, “I am strong.” Lion is respected. So I can talk Buddha’s teaching pretty well, and you respect, what does he mean? I cannot think of myself, “Oh, I am Buddha.” I don’t think so. This is just like owls who can at night; same thing. What’s the difference? So don’t be bragging. Don’t think of life roughly. You are originally stupid, so shut up. *[He laughs.]* That is exactly *boom*. That’s pretty nice, isn’t it? It’s like hitting him with a whisk. 

#### 1:01:32

**Question**: When you say that you have to do what you have to do and you shouldn’t do what you shouldn’t, where does that come from, that *having to do*? And you say in relation to the training period just follow the schedule, but supposing that what you feel that you have to do is not something that’s necessarily ...

**Katagiri**: No. Just you have to do what you have to do. According to the schedule, and ... 

**Same person**: How do you decide what you have to do? 

**Katagiri**: Well, you already decide your attendance of the training session, so you already decided.

**Same person**: Okay, but does that apply to other things besides training sessions? In your life you feel that there’s certain things that you want to do or need to do? 

**Katagiri**: Oh of course, in your daily life I don’t think you always do something related with training sessions. You cannot do it. So you have to go to work, but in the “go to work” means still if you go to school and teach, you have to do something you have to do. Always there is something you have to do. So how do we know there’s something you have to do? Well we should learn. We should learn what it is. You can learn. 

If you do something wrong, maybe you bump your head against a pole and get a bump. *[He laughs.]* You know? So through this, everyday life, we can learn. But as much as possible we should hit our forehead against an electric pole when you walk on the street. That is a teaching. We have to listen to the teaching, and also we have to practice – risk a bump on your head. If you want, you can get lots of bumps on your head, but we should [less], we should confine the bumps to the minimum.

**Question**: Roshi? I still don’t understand where it says, “The Governor said, ‘The Buddhist Law and the Law of Kings are the same.’”

**Katagiri**: That means the teachers understanding is the Buddhist Law. The Buddhist Law doesn’t mean something teaching apart from human life. It’s connected to human life. So Lu P’i, and governors, including Hsueh Zen Master, are nothing but beings which are in the bustling marketplace. So nevertheless, right in the midst of the bustling marketplace, we have to understand the Buddha law. So Buddha law, and also the law of kings is the same thing.

**Question**: Hojo-san, did I understand correctly a phrase which you said a few times, “You need a boss”? 

**Katagiri**: “Both.”

**Question**: Oh, I misheard you.

**Katagiri**: Oh, I see, b-o-t-h, not b-o-s-s. *[Laughter.]*
