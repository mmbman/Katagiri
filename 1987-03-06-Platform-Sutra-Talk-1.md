> Once a customer bought firewood and ordered it delivered to his shop. When the delivery had been made, and Hui Neng had received the money, he went outside the gate, where he noticed a customer reciting a Sutra. Upon once hearing the words of this Sutra: “One should produce that thought which is nowhere supported.” Hui Neng’s mind immediately opened to enlightenment.

> (From *The Sixth Patriarch’s Dharma Jewel Platform Sutra*: https://www.thezensite.com/ZenTeachings/Translations/PlatformSutra_DharmaJewel.pdf)

**Katagiri Roshi:** 

... mind which is originally clear and pure. So one should produce the mind which is nowhere supported because the truth is not something [like] stagnant water, the truth is something moving and active. 

So there is nothing to hold in your hand, there is nowhere supported. Nowhere attached ... this means one should produce the mind which is nowhere supported. And then we [may] attain enlightenment at that time. 

Next,

> Thereupon he asked the customer what Sutra he was reciting. The customer replied, “*The Diamond Sutra*.”
>
> Then again he asked, “Where do you come from, and why do you recite this Sutra?”
>
> The customer said, “I come from Tung Ch’an Monastery in Ch’i Chou, Huang Mei Province. There the Fifth Patriarch, the Great Master Hung Jen dwells, teaching over one thousand disciples. I went there to make obeisance and heard and received this Sutra. The Great Master constantly exhorts the Sangha and laity only to uphold The Diamond Sutra. Then, they may see their own nature and straightaway achieve Buddhahood.”
>
> Hui Neng heard this and desired to go and seek the Dharma, but he recalled that his mother had no support. 
>
> From past lives there were karmic conditions which led another man to give Hui Neng a pound of silver, so that he could provide clothing and food for his aging mother. The man instructed him further to go to Huang Mei to call upon and bow to the Fifth Patriarch.

The fifth patriarch constantly emphasizes the spirit of *Diamond Sutra*, saying that they may see their own nature and straightaway achieve Buddhahood. This is very common; Zen Buddhism always [talks about] this. Even in Japan, even in China, the real spirit of Zen is to see into one’s own nature and achieve Buddhahood straightforwardly. That is the point Zen Buddhism always mentions. 

But I think this is a little bit questionable. I think Dogen Zenji mentions usually the buddha nature [in] *Shobogenzo*. And also in Zen Master Dogen, Dogen Zenji mentions about monks at the four stages of meditation. I think in this chapter he [talks] about the criticism toward that point. [Zen] usually mentions to see into one’s own nature and become straightaway Buddhahood. For instance he mentions in that chapter:

> The essence of *Buddhadharma* has never been to see into one’s own nature. Which of the seven past Buddhas or twenty-eight Indian patriarchs ever said that Buddhadharma consisted merely of seeing into one’s own nature? It is true that the sixth patriarch spoke about this question in the *Platform Sutra*, but as this a forged writing, it cannot be said to represent his true teachings, or to have the transmission of the dharma. We descendents of the Buddha shouldn’t rely on it. 

Something like that. 

And in the *Sutra of the Mountains and Waters*, Dogen Zenji [says] also, “Transforming the environment, transforming the mind, is something scorned by great sages. Speaking of mind, speaking of nature” – *speaking of nature* means speaking of one’s original nature – “is something not approved by buddhas and Zen adepts. Seeing into the mind, seeing into one’s own nature, is the livelihood of heretics. Sticking to words and phrases is not the explanation of liberation.” 

So Dogen Zenji strongly criticizes that pretty usual emphasis of Zen Buddhism in those days, [or] even now. Because if you emphasize [that] the main point of Zen Buddhism is seeing into one’s own nature by zazen, at that time I think it is still very dualistic. 

So by zazen and by Zen practice you have to achieve, you have to see [the] true nature of the self, and then become Buddha – this is [a] pretty usual understanding of Zen practice and Buddhist practice. But at that time, in the basic state of existence, I think you cannot escape or be free from agitations and hesitations, uneasiness of your mind, always, because you try to get peace and harmony dualistically. [You think,] “I am not perfect, that’s why I need something.” So that is always something agitating you, and makes your life uneasy.

But Dogen Zenji always [says] your basic nature is exactly Buddha. It is not [just] Dogen’s teaching, but the *Nirvana Sutra*, and also the *Diamond Sutra* and *Prajnaparamita* [Sutra says this]. So *Nirvana Sutra* mentions constantly that we are Buddha, all sentient beings are Buddha. So we have to stand up in the Buddha Nature, stand up at the place where all sentient beings are Buddha from the beginning to end. That is the main point. 

I think if you read the “Buddha Nature” [chapter] of *Shobogenzo* (“Busshō”), [it’s] a little bit difficult to understand, but you would taste what the buddha nature is. So that is a most important chapter for you to understand Dogen Zenji’s teaching, and also Buddha’s teaching, [that is,] in terms of general Buddhism. 

#### 11:32

So according to Dogen’s point, buddha nature, there are two points. 

According to *Nirvana Sutra*, he mentions about buddha nature, he quoted the sentence of *Nirvana Sutra*. And commented on this. So there are two points he mentioned.

One point is, “All beings without exception are Buddha.” Buddha nature. This is one point. 

And second, “Buddha nature is”... how can I say [...] “time and occasion, and cause and conditions.” Literal translation. Buddha nature is time and occasion, case and conditions. 

So two meanings. 

So all beings, without exception, are buddha nature. That means, whatever you may be, whatever you think, whatever you don’t think, all beings are completely buddha. So, nothing else to compare with. So all are completely buddha. So, there is nothing wrong, nothing “good” – it’s perfectly buddha. 

So that is the truth Dogen Zenji constantly mentions. That is buddha nature, we say. 

If so, we immediately think buddha nature is something like the very basic nature of existence from which makes all sentient beings alive (?). So the buddha nature is something absolute, or buddha nature is something eternal. We think [this] immediately. So very basic nature of existence. But that is not real buddha nature! That’s why the second point is, “Buddha nature is time and occasion, cause and conditions.”

So buddha nature is always something happen... buddha nature is that which occurs, according to time and occasion, and cause and conditions. That means, we you come here, this is your life. When you walk, this is your life, so-called walking on the street. So always there is a cause and conditions. 

Cause and conditions means all opportunities, all chances, all forms you are confounded with, all opportunity you face, day to day, from moment to moment. This is time and occasion, we say. 

“When the spring comes, flower blooms.” When you see the flower, this is time and occasion. And that form of flower has conditions and causes. So, form of flowers consists of lots of time and occasion, and cause and conditions. So behind the tiny flower, here is a huge world. It is working together; *then* we can see form of flowers with our naked eye. But behind this tiny flower we cannot see, because it’s huge. 

So that’s why buddha nature is time and occasion, cause and conditions. That means, nothing to hold. The second point means, just functions, activities. So buddha nature is what? Activities. Functions. Process. That’s it.

So there is nothing to hold as fixed beings, fixed entities. Nothing. 

#### 17:33 

I think...

And then from that buddha nature, how can you call this buddha nature, which is called nothing but activities, process, and functioning in dynamism? How can you call this?

So finally, Dogen Zenji [says], that buddha nature may be called no buddha nature. Because no buddha nature is very close term to explain the true picture of buddha nature. Because it is nothing to hold. That’s why no buddha nature. 

And then from that no buddha nature, we can see buddha nature or no buddha nature – the idea of buddha nature or the idea of no buddha nature. Which means the phenomenal world coming up. 

So that is in the chapter “Buddha Nature,” Dogen Zenji mentions about Joshu’s koan, does a dog have buddha nature or not. 

#### 19:32

Let’s go [to] page 43:  (page 56 in the PDF)

> “The Great Master constantly exhorts the Sangha and laity only to uphold The Diamond Sutra. Then, they may see their own nature and straightaway achieve Buddhahood.”
>
> Hui Neng heard this and desired to go and seek the Dharma, but he recalled that his mother had no support. From past lives there were karmic conditions which led another man to give Hui Neng a pound of silver, so that he could provide clothing and food for his aging mother. The man instructed him further to go to Huang
Mei to call upon and bow to the Fifth Patriarch.

The next page:

> After Hui Neng had made arrangements for his mother’s welfare, he took his leave. In less than thirty days he arrived at Huang Mei and made obeisance to the Fifth Patriarch, who asked him, “Where are you from and what do you seek?”
>
> Hui Neng replied, “Your disciple is a commoner from Hsin Chou in Ling Nan and comes from afar to bow to the Master, seeking only to be a Buddha, and nothing else.”
>
> The Patriarch said, “You are from Ling Nan and are therefore a barbarian, so how can you become a Buddha?”
>
> Hui Neng said, “Although there are people from the north and people from the south, there is ultimately no north or south in the Buddha nature. The body of the barbarian and that of the High Master are not the same, but what distinction is there in the Buddha nature?”
>
> The Fifth Patriarch wished to continue the conversation, but seeing his disciples gathering on all sides, he ordered his visitor to follow the group off to work. Hui Neng said, “Hui Neng informs the High Master that this disciple’s mind constantly produces wisdom and is not separate from the self nature. That, itself, is the field of blessing. It has not yet been decided what work the High Master will instruct me to do.”
>
> The Fifth Patriarch said, “Barbarian, your faculties are too sharp. Do not speak further, but go to the back courtyard.” Hui Neng withdrew to the back courtyard where a cultivator ordered him to split firewood and thresh rice.
> 
> More than eight months had passed when the Patriarch one day suddenly saw Hui Neng and said, “I think these views of yours can be of use but fear that evil people may harm you. For that reason I have not spoken with you. Did you understand the situation?”
>
> Hui Neng replied, “Your disciple knew the Master’s intention and has stayed out of the front hall, so that others might not notice him.”

*[Tape skip.]*

... Hui Neng was too sharp, and the conversation between Hui Neng and his teacher, the Fifth Patriarch, was going pretty well, expressing his wisdom. And so he didn’t want to continue to have a conversation between two in front of the assembly. That what he tried to keep away from. 

Anyway, here is the conversation between Hui Neng and the Fifth Patriarch. I think you can see this conversation in the chapter “Buddha Nature” also. 

And here it says, “From where do you come?” And Hui Neng said he comes from Ling Nan. Ling Nan in China. And also the teacher says, “If you come from Ling Nan, I think the people in Ling Nan don’t have buddha nature. How can you become buddha nature?” Because, I don’t know exactly, but people in Ling Nan were pretty poor, and commoners, not educated so much. So Hui Neng in this story I think was not an educated person. So he couldn’t read sutras, he couldn’t write [...] But on the other hand, in the Fifth Patriarch’s monastery, I think [Jin Shu], which is constructed, who was the *shuso*, the head monk of the monastery, was very educated and sharp person. So [Jin Shu] \[was] *shuso* and head monk, and Hui Neng, are very contrasting persons. So anyway, that’s why he mentioned, “If you come from Ling Nan, they are barbarians, they don’t have buddha nature. How can you become buddha nature?”

But Dogen Zenji comments on this [store] conversation in the chapter on “Buddha Nature”; you should read this carefully. That’s an interesting commentary there. The point he really comments on this is, the people in Ling Nan don’t have buddha nature, means no buddha nature. It is not something wrong which the fifth patriarch mentions, but it is nothing but expression of what real buddha nature is. So that real nature of the truth, buddha nature, is expressed as no buddha nature. Because it is nothing but the function and activities. 

It is activity created or produced by time and occasion, and cause and conditions, constantly. So if so, if it is true, there is nothing to say. No perception, no word particularly. So what term is appropriate to express that truth as it is? So we say, “No truth. No buddha nature.” We can use a negative term. But that “no buddha nature” is not negative, but a manifestation of the function and process in dynamism. That is the meaning of “no buddha nature.” So Dogen Zenji [talks] about that point. 

So [...] Hui Neng [says], “Although there are people from the north and people from the south, there is ultimately no north or south in buddha nature.” That is, he denied the fifth’s patriarch statement in terms of the *Nirvana Sutra*. So *Nirvana Sutra* mentions always all beings are buddha nature. 

So, “The body of the barbarian and that of the high master are not the same, but what distinction is there in the buddha nature?” But Dogen Zenji understands this conversation pretty deeply. That’s an interesting point too.

#### 30:35

So next page... forty-seven...

> One day the Patriarch summoned his disciples together and said, “I have something to say to you: for people in the world, the matter of birth and death is a great one.
>
> “All day long you seek fields of blessings only; you do not try to get out of the bitter sea of birth and death. If you are confused about your self-nature, how can blessings save you?”

Here it says, “‘I have something to say to you: for people in the world, the matter of birth and death is a great one.’” That is a main point we have to always pay attention to in monastic life: the matter of birth and death is most important things. So on the *han*, [the udon gong], [there are] several characters there that say: “Life and death is a great matter.”

And also he says, “All day long you seek fields of blessings only...” That means your original nature is already blessed, already *gifted*, with buddha nature, field of blessing. Your nature is buddha nature. So you should seek fields of blessing only: “... you do not try to get out of the bitter sea of birth and death.” Because if you try to get out of this bitter sea of birth and death, already you are standing at dualistic place. So your basic nature and foundation is very shaky. If the foundation of your life is not stable, at that time, how can you realize the field of blessing? How can you take care of the phenomenal world, which seems to be confused? So that’s why he says, If you are confused about your self-nature, how can blessings save you?”

I think, strictly speaking, your self nature is never confused. So Dogen Zenji says in [Doctorio Jishu], he [says], “If you want to study the buddha way, you should believe that there is no confusion, no misunderstand, no delusions,” et cetera. So your life is always going in the path of the true nature, the path of *dharma*, Dogen Zenji [says]. And then, we can practice buddha nature, we can practice the buddha way. But if the foundation is always found in the dualistic world, your life becomes very uneasy. So you never taste spiritual peace and harmony. But usually the foundation is found always in the dualistic way. Even in religion, we practice in that way. 

So that’s way, the fifth patriarch says, “If you are confused about your self-nature, how can blessings save you?” Self-nature is confused, but if you don’t manifest self-nature as [your] steadfast foundation, your self-nature is never manifested as steadfast foundation. So that’s why it says, “If you are confused about your self-nature,” but actually, self-nature is never confused. But if you don’t manifest it as steadfast way of life, then, it’s confused. 

#### 36:03

So next, 

> “Each of you go back and look into your own wisdom and use the Prajna-nature of your own original mind to compose a verse. Submit it to me so that I may look at it.
>
> “If you understand the great meaning, the robe and Dharma will be passed on to you and you will become the sixth patriarch. Hurry off! Do not delay! Thinking and considering is of no use in this matter. When seeing your own nature it is necessary to see it at the very moment of speaking. One who does that perceives as does one who wields a sword in the height of battle.”

Next page,

> The assembly received this order and withdrew, saying to one another, “We of the assembly do not need to clear our minds and use our intellect to compose a verse to submit to the High Master. What use would there be in this?”
>
> “Shen Hsiu is our senior instructor and teaching transmitter...”

Shen Hsiu was the head monk at that time. That person was pretty smart and sharp, that’s why the monks trusted him and considered him as the successtor. 

> “... Certainly he should be the one to obtain it. It would be not only improper for us to compose a verse, but a waste of effort as well.”
> 
> Hearing this, everyone put his mind to rest, and said, “Henceforth, we will rely on Master Shen Hsiu. Why vex ourselves writing verses?”

*[He laughs.]* So other monks, they don’t want to make a verse and submit it to the teacher, because here is the great head monk there, regarded as the next successor. So even though the monks try to make a verse, it is useless. 

So next, 

> Shen Hsiu then thought, “The others are not submitting verses because I am their teaching transmitter. I must compose a verse and submit it to the High Master.
>
> “If I do not submit a verse, how will the High Master know whether the views and understanding in my mind are deep or shallow?
>
> “If my intention in submitting the verse is to seek the Dharma, that is good. But if it is to grasp the patriarchate, that is bad, for how would that be different from the mind of a common person coveting the holy position? But, if I do not submit a verse, in the end I will not obtain the Dharma. This is a terrible difficulty!”

This is Shen Hsiu’s very honest reflection upon himself. Very honest. Thinking, “Should I write a poem and submit it to the teacher? For what?” Already the Fifth Patriarch [says] if you compose great things, you could be successor of his lineage as the Sixth Patriarch. So if [Shen Hsiu] was commanded respect from other monks, already it was very clear for him to become the successor. So he started to reflect upon himself: “Why do you want to write a poem and submit it to him? Do you want to be the successor? Is this your purpose? Or, to seek for the dharma?” 

Just like the *Vimalakirti Sutra*. Shariputra went to see Vimalakirti who was sick. And his room was very small, and there were five hundred bodhisattvas already there, but no chair. Pretty small room. So Shariputra asked him, “How can we get into this small room [with] no chair?” And Vimalakirti said, “What do you want? Do you come here to seek for the dharma, or to get the chair?” Shariputra says, “Oh, yes, we try to get the dharma.” And then, five hundred monks and bodhisattvas can get in to that room. The same story is there. 

So Shen Hsiu’s reflection is just like this. Very honest and very nice reflection here. That’s why he says, “If my intention in submitting the dharma, that is good. But if it is to grasp the patriarchate” – in other words, to grasp a certain position, and fame, et cetera – “it is not good, for how would that be different from the mind of a common person coveting the holy position?” 

But on the other hand, if he doesn’t compose a poem, how does the fifth patriarch know whether Shen Hsiu is appropriate person to become the Sixth Patriarch or not? So he has to do it. So that’s why here it says, “But, if I do not submit a verse, in the end I will not obtain the Dharma. This is a terrible difficulty!” This is very difficult situation he honestly faces and reflects upon himself. 

This is pretty nice. So next, 

> In front of the Fifth Patriarch’s hall were three corridors. Their walls were to be frescoed by Court Artist Lu Chen with stories from the *Lankavatara Sutra* and with pictures portraying in detail the lives of the five patriarchs, so that the patriarchs might be venerated by future generations.

I think on the wall of the corridors, I think the artist painted the picture of the fifth patriarch portrait, and also his lineage, in order to let the monks know what is lineage was, and also respect. 

> After composing his verse, Shen Hsiu made several attempts to submit it. But whenever he reached the front hall, his mind became agitated and distraught, and his entire body became covered with perspiration. He did not dare submit it, although in the course of four days he made thirteen attempts.

But he couldn’t do it. So, he was very agitated. 

> Then he thought, “This is not as good as writing it on the wall so that the High Master might see it suddenly. If he says it is good, I will come forward, bow, and say, ‘Hsiu did it.’ If it does not pass, then I have spent my years on this mountain in vain, receiving veneration from others. And as to further cultivation–what can I say?”
>
> That night, in the third watch, holding a candle he secretly wrote the verse on the wall of the South corridor, to show what his mind had seen.

So finally he decided to write the poem on the wall of the corridor, instead of giving his poem directly to the fifth patriarch. Because thirteen times he tried, but he couldn’t do it. So that’s why he decided in that way. 

So next, the verse is,

>> The body is a Bodhi tree,  
>> The mind like a bright mirror stand.  
>> Time and again brush it clean,  
>> And let no dust alight.  
>
> After writing this verse, Shen Hsiu returned to his room, and the others did not know what he had done.
>
> Then he thought, “If the Fifth Patriarch sees the verse tomorrow and is pleased, it will mean that I have an affinity with the Dharma. If he says that it does not pass, it will mean that I am confused by heavy karmic obstacles from past lives, and that I am not fit to obtain the Dharma. It is difficult to fathom the sage’s intentions.”
>
> In his room he thought it over and could not sit or sleep peacefully right through to the fifth watch.

So, anyway, he couldn’t sleep because he was very concerned about his poem written on the wall. So his poem is pretty well-known by everyone as one of the Zen stories. 

>> The body is a Bodhi tree,  
>> The mind like a bright mirror stand.  
>> Time and again brush it clean,  
>> And let no dust alight.  

And later, I think Hui Neng wrote the ... I think page 56, Hui Neng also wrote his poem. His poem is, 

> Originally Bodhi has no tree,  
> The bright mirror has no stand.  
> Originally there is not a single thing:  
> Where can dust alight?  

Sometimes people deal with the two poems separately, and evaluate which is right, which is wrong. But I don’t think [that] is the right understanding. Both poems work together in our practice. I think you cannot separate them.
