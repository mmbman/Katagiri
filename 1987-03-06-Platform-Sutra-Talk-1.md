**Katagiri Roshi:** 

> Once a customer bought firewood and ordered it delivered to his shop. When the delivery had been made, and Hui Neng had received the money, he went outside the gate, where he noticed a customer reciting a Sutra. Upon once hearing the words of this Sutra: “One should produce that thought which is nowhere supported.” Hui Neng’s mind immediately opened to enlightenment.)
>
> (From https://www.thezensite.com/ZenTeachings/Translations/PlatformSutra_DharmaJewel.pdf)


... the mind which is originally clear and pure, so one should produce the mind which is nowhere supported, because the truth is not something [like] stagnant water, the truth is something moving and active. 

So there is nothing to hold in your hand, there is nowhere supported. Nowhere attached ... this means one should produce the mind which is nowhere supported. And then we may attain enlightenment at that time. 

Next,

> Thereupon he asked the customer what Sutra he was reciting. The customer replied, “*The Diamond Sutra*.”
>
> Then again he asked, “Where do you come from, and why do you recite this Sutra?”
>
> The customer said, “I come from Tung Ch’an Monastery in Ch’i Chou, Huang Mei Province. There the Fifth Patriarch, the Great Master Hung Jen dwells, teaching over one thousand disciples. I went there to make obeisance and heard and received this Sutra. The Great Master constantly exhorts the Sangha and laity only to uphold The Diamond Sutra. Then, they may see their own nature and straightaway achieve Buddhahood.”
>
> Hui Neng heard this and desired to go and seek the Dharma, but he recalled that his mother had no support. 
>
> From past lives there were karmic conditions which led another man to give Hui Neng a pound of silver, so that he could provide clothing and food for his aging mother. The man instructed him further to go to Huang Mei to call upon and bow to the Fifth Patriarch.

The fifth patriarch constantly emphasizes the spirit of Diamond Sutra, saying that they may see their own nature and straightaway achieve Buddhahood. This is very common; Zen Buddhism always mentions this. Even in Japan, even in China, the real spirit of Zen is to see into one’s own nature and achieve Buddhahood straightforwardly. That is the point Zen Buddhism always mentions. But this is a little bit questionable, I think. I think Dogen Zenji mentions I think usually the Buddha Nature of Shobogenzo. And also in Zen Master Dogen, Dogen Zenji mentions about monks at the four stages of meditation. I think in this chapter he mentions about the criticism toward that point. Usually mentions to see into ones own nature and become straightaway Buddhahood. For instance he mentions in that chapter, 

> The essence of Buddhadharma has never been to see into ones own nature. Which of the seven past Buddhas or twenty-eight Indian patriarchs ever said that Buddhadharma consisted merely of seeing into ones own nature? It is true that the sixth patriarch spoke about this question in the Platform Sutra, but as this a forged writing, it cannot be said to represent his true teachings, or to have the transmission of the dharma. We descendents of the Buddha shouldn’t rely on it. 

Something like that. 

And in the sutra of the mountains and waters, Dogen Zenji mentions also, “Transforming the environment, transforming the mind, is something scorned by great sages. Speaking of mind, speaking of nature” – speaking of nature means speaking of ones original nature – “is something not approved by Buddhas and Zen adepts. Seeing into the mind, seeing into ones own nature, is the livelihood of heretics. Sticking to words and phrases is not the explanation of liberation.” 

So Dogen Zenji strongly criticizes that pretty usual emphasize of Zen Buddhism in those days; even now. Because if you emphasize that the main point of Zen Buddhism is seeing into one’s own nature by zazen, at that time I think it is still very dualistic. So by zazen and by Zen practice you have to achieve, you have to see true nature of the self, and then become Buddha – this is pretty usual understanding of Zen practice and Buddhist practice. But at that time in the basic state of existence, I think you cannot escape or you cannot be free from agitations and hesitations, uneasiness of your mind, always. Because you try to get peace and harmony dualistically. “I am not perfect, that’s why I need something.” So that is always something agitating you, and makes your life uneasy.

But Dogen Zenji mentions always your basic nature is exactly Buddha. It is not Dogen’s teaching, but the Nirvana Sutra, and also the Diamond Sutra, ... Prajnaparamita [Sutra] mentions. So Nirvana Sutra mentions constantly that we are Buddha. All sentient beings are Buddha. So we have to stand up in the Buddha Nature, stand up at the place where all sentient beings are Buddha from the beginning to end. That is the main point. 

I think if you read hte Buddha Nature of Shobogenzo, a little bit difficult to understand, but you would taste what the Buddha Nature is. So that is the most important chapter for you to understand Dogen Zenji’s teaching, and also Buddha’s teaching, in terms of general Buddhism. 

So according to Dogen’s point, Buddha Nature, there are two points.
