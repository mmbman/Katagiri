title: "Mindfulness"
---

In this series of talks, Katagiri Roshi explains mindfulness from the viewpoint of Zen Master Dogen. The talks discuss the first part of the *Sanjūshichi-bon-bodai-bunpō* (“Thirty-Seven Conditions Contributing to Bodhisattva Practice”) chapter of *Shobogenzo*. 

This series might be seen as challenging, as it presents a radically different view of mindfulness from what one might expect based on how it is presented in mainstream culture. Specifically, some points to consider here might be: 

- Mindfulness is not a set of techniques.
- Mindfulness is not exclusively focused on the self.
- Mindfulness is not *narrowly* goal-oriented.

These talks were given during a five-day *sesshin* in March, 1984.

##### [Mindfulness – Talk 1](1984-03-21-Mindfulness-Talk-1)

Katagiri Roshi explains the first aspect of mindfulness, mindfulness of the body, from the viewpoint of Zen Master Dogen. Mindfulness is “observing that the body is a bag of skin that covers the entire universe.” In this talk, he introduces the topic of why we must go beyond the idea of purity or impurity of the body, and how *samatha* (tranquility) and *vipassana* (insight) function together.

##### [Mindfulness – Talk 2](1984-03-22-Mindfulness-Talk-2)

The body is *total dynamic working*, and *total dynamic working* is like a maple leaf falling, showing its front and back. And also the maple leaf is sucked into a black hole. Failure is really development and growth. There is more discussion of *shamata* and *vipassana*, the intersection of time and space, and the meaning of “mind only.”

##### [Mindfulness – Talk 3](1984-03-23-Mindfulness-Talk-3)

Mindfulness is not an idea of mindfulness. If you observe the body, the body observes you, and then all sentient beings support your observation. There is no one-way traffic. Liberation comes from action, but that action must come from emptiness, or liberation itself. First, we have to have a very deep faith that all sentient beings have the-same-and-one-nature. And then, we have to establish the state of mind that is like a wall, which is emptiness.

##### [Mindfulness – Talk 4](1984-03-24-Mindfulness-Talk-4)

Katagiri Roshi discusses “demons-becoming-buddhas,” “buddhas-becoming-buddhas,” and “people-becoming-buddhas,” and how this relates to mindfulness of the body.

##### [Mindfulness – Talk 5](1984-03-25-Mindfulness-Talk-5)

Katagiri Roshi concludes his series of talks on Mindfulness. Zen Master Dogen compares the method of Buddhist practice to the method of washing a robe. Mindfulness is dynamic communication. This moment is a blank canvas.
