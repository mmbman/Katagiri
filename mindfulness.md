##### [Mindfulness – Talk 1](1984-03-21-Mindfulness-Talk-1)

Katagiri Roshi explains the first aspect of mindfulness, mindfulness of the body, from the viewpoint of Zen Master Dogen. This series of talks discusses the first part of the *Sanjūshichi-bon-bodai-bunpō* (“Thirty-Seven Conditions Contributing to Bodhisattva Practice”) chapter of *Shobogenzo*. In this talk, he introduces the topic of why we must go beyond the idea of purity or impurity of the body, and how *samatha* (tranquility) and *vipassana* (insight) function together.

##### [Mindfulness – Talk 2](1984-03-22-Mindfulness-Talk-2)

The body is *total dynamic working*, and *total dynamic working* is like a maple leaf falling, showing its front and back. And also, the maple leaf is sucked into a black hole. Failure is really development and growth. There is more discussion of *shamata* and *vipassana*, the intersection of time and space, and the meaning of “mind only.”

##### [Mindfulness – Talk 3](1984-03-23-Mindfulness-Talk-3)

Katagiri Roshi continues to comment on the *Sanjūshichi-bon-bodai-bunpō* chapter of *Shobogenzo*, on mindfulness of body. Mindfulness is not an idea of mindfulness: if you observe the body, the body observes you, and then all sentient beings support your observation. There is no one-way traffic. Liberation comes from action, but that action must come from emptiness, or liberation itself. First we have to have a very deep faith that all sentient beings have the-same-and-one-nature; and then we have to establish the state of our mind that is like a wall, which is emptiness.
