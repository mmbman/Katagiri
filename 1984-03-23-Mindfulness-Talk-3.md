### Summary

If you observe the body, the body observes you. There is no one-way traffic. And then, all sentient beings support your observation. Liberation comes from action, but that action must come from emptiness, or liberation itself. Translating *Shobogenzo* into English, or even modern Japanese, is hard.

### Transcript

**This transcript is in rough draft stage.**

**This talk is split into two files in the audio archive: [Part 1](#part-1) and [Part 2](#part-2)**

### Part 1

<a href="https://www.mnzencenter.org/the-dainin-katagiri-audio-archive/track-1-of-29220017" target="_blank">Listen to Part 1 of this talk on mnzencenter.org</a> 

Let me read the next part:

> Observing the body is body observing, that is not the observation of other things. The observation at the very moment is far and away the most excellent occurrence. When body observing is manifested, mind observing cannot be groped and found, nor manifested. Therefore it becomes *vajra samadhi* and *śūraṃgama samadhi*; both are observation of the body as not-pure. The principle behind Shakyamuni’s sighting of the morning star at dawn is called *observing the body as not-pure*. It is beyond a matter of drawing comparison between purity and impurity. It is body-being-is-not-pure, or body-manifesting-is-not-pure. 

[Probably] you don’t understand what it says. Even in Japanese, we don’t understand he wants to say. 

I translated [this part] a different way from this [other] version (translated by Kōzen Nishiyama). [That one] tries to translate the original [in a way where] he wants readers to understand it if they read it. That’s very compassionate, very kind. But at that time, that translation goes far away from the original. Because Dogen Zenji uses terms, for instance *body-being-is-not-pure*, and *body-manifesting-is-not-pure*, as one word, not separately. Each word has a very profound meaning. If you try to translate it in plain words in order to make people understand through your knowledge, completely it is far from the original. Even though in Japanese we don’t understand it, each term [Dogen] uses has a reason why he used it, and it has very profound meaning. That’s why I translate it in a different way, even though you don’t understand it. 

But that’s a very interesting thing which always happens in *Shobogenzo*. People don’t understand it, and if people don’t understand it, we try to make *Shobogenzo* read in an easy way. But if you do that, the translation becomes very shallow. Through that translation you can convey Dogen’s thought or religion in a sense, but in a very shallow way. It’s pretty difficult to translate it into English, or into modern Japanese *[he laughs]* – it’s pretty hard. So that’s why we have to directly face the original text, and try to understand. That’s pretty important. For century after century, many priests and monks have done it in that way.

> Observing the body is body observing, that is not the observation of other things.

We have to see something alive with our body and with the observation or contemplation, not the idea of something particular. Through your body and mind, through your activity, you have to find something *alive* in human life, in everyday life. That’s the point that Dogen Zenji always tries to say. 

So through the practice of mindfulness, we have to find something alive, beyond the idea of mindfulness. If we say, “Let’s practice mindfulness,” you always try to concentrate on the breath, and then you say, “I have completed the practice of mindfulness.” I don’t think so! That is that you have an idea of mindfulness, for a certain period of time, in a certain area, so-called *breath*. No! Next moment, right after the breath, you have to return to everyday life – and then the mindfulness is completely gone. [Then] you don’t know how to practice mindfulness. 

So real mindfulness, you have to find something really vividly alive with your body. [That] mindfulness means real mindfulness *beyond* mindfulness, beyond the idea of mindfulness. We say *mindfulness-and-no-mindfulness*. You should be free from mindfulness. *Free from* means your body must be exactly mindfulness. *Freedom*, liberation, means your body and the idea of mindfulness become one, and also practice and you must be one. Your thinking must be one with mindfulness. All becoming one with mindfulness, that is called *mindfulness*. How can you leave a trace of mindfulness right there? [You can’t.] Because the whole world, your body, your mind, becomes completely filled with mindfulness, and your circumstances are completely filled with mindfulness. Everywhere, mindfulness. If so, do we have to emphasize particularly strongly that “I am doing mindfulness”? No. No, [there is] no idea. That’s why very naturally the idea of mindfulness drops off. That is called *no mindfulness*, or open heart, open mindfulness. Or *freedom*; liberation of the mindfulness. 

“Not-pure”: I use [the word] *not-pure* this time instead of *impure*. I think not-pure is better, because *not* as a negative expression means that your life and tree’s life and all sentient beings are completely embraced by the-same-and-one-nature – so-called Buddha Nature, or whatever you say. If everything is completely filled with the-same-and-one-nature, at that time it’s not necessary to emphasize a particular time (or instance) called “the-same-and-one-nature,” because everything is one nature. So very naturally the idea of the-same-and-one-nature drops off. That is called *no-buddha-nature*. 

So Buddha Nature means completely pure, the whole world is filled with purity. At that time, everyone is pure, *beyond* pure and not-pure. At that time, whatever you pick up, it is pure. If so, it’s not necessary to say, “I am practicing purity.” No. So the idea of purity drops off; that is called *not-pure*. We say *not-purity*. 

*Not-purity* means negating purity, but this not-pure means the spirit of being filled with purity. At that time, no purity. That is called not-pure. At that time you [can] find something alive. You can taste, you can experience something alive. That is your body: you have to find it within your body, with your body, and you have to find it through the practice of observation, contemplation, or mindfulness. 

So [it is] not the idea of mindfulness, because... Let me say that observation is completely pure, perfectly pure, beyond purity or impurity. Why? Because if you contemplate or if you observe something, your object, [then] *you* observe your object. That is the dualistic sense; [it is] very common. And then you judge immediately; think something. That is really taking care of human life according to “one-way traffic”. You never think of two-way traffic. Because if you observe your object, the object observes you. In other words, you are *observed* by your object. That is subject and object: subject and object are always interacting like this, simultaneously. But our sense is always setting up subject and object [as] separate, and next moment, [instead of seeing] that interaction, we judge it by our customs or patterns of thinking. So that’s why next moment we stumble. 

So Buddhism always sees that subject and object, because this is a very natural situation. But instead of seeing something and judging it, [the object] being judged by your sense – see something alive between [them], how subject and object are working together. That is interpenetration, or *interdependence*, we say. 

#### 17:15

Yesterday I told you about the poem composed by Ryokan: 

> A maple leaf, showing its back and its front. It is falling.

The back and front is subject and object, in other words the dualistic world. The idea of the maple leaf, so-called life and death, is nothing but front and back, the dualistic world. If you *think* it. Very naturally [it is] showing the front, showing the back. But you cannot judge the life of the maple leaf in terms of just the front, when it appears. No. Next moment, the front disappears and the back appears. And finally you don’t know what the life of the maple leaf is: is it the front, or is it the back? No. Always front and back, front and back, interactive. And that is what? Action. Activity, motion. That is something alive of the life of the maple leaf. It doesn’t stop even for a moment; it’s always going like this. 

Finally, you don’t know what the maple leaf is. The maple leaf just functions: total dynamic working, that’s it. But if you think it, if you judge it, if you make a choice of your life, very naturally you can say, “It’s the back,” [or] “It’s the front.” But that is an idea: a philosophical idea, a biological idea, [or] a psychological idea. But something alive within the life of the maple leaf is always moving, and acting; constantly functioning.

\[For example]: I observe the tape recorder, [and] the tape recorder observes me. *Who* observes? *I* observe? No. The tape recorder observes me? If so, if I see the state of the observation, at that time can I say, “I observe the tape recorder?” No; completely no. Or, the tape recorder observes me? No. So what is the *real* observation? Real observation is just total dynamic working between the tape recorder and I. And then, if I think it, and if I think of that state of the observation in terms of a particular angle, so-called *I*, then *I* observe, just *I* – not tape recorder, *I*. Tape recorder observes tape recorder. Because between the tape recorder and I, always interacting. So you cannot separate, you cannot analyze between the tape recorder and I right in the middle of the total dynamic working of the tape recorder and I. No; it’s just like the maple leaf. 

So that is observation. Observation is completely oneness, and oneness is emptiness: nothing to pin down. That is called *the-same-and-one-nature*. So the front of the maple leaf is always functioning in the realm of the-same-and-one-nature, [back] is always working in the realm of the-same-and-one-nature. What is this? What is the functioning, what is the total dynamic working of the maple leaf? That is called emptiness. 

#### 22:42

Yesterday I told you that liberation comes from action. But don’t misunderstand this *action*. That action must be based on emptiness. Don’t expect something [to be] liberated by your action, by the practice of liberation. No, because your action must be liberated. 

So if you say, “By my action, I want to create something liberated,” that is already separate. So [there is] no communication there, because you try to create something, you are always going out – so you don’t look at yourself. [If] you are always going out, that means you are empty *how*, inside or out? So you’re always trying to get some ideas in order to justify yourself. 

[For example,] that’s why [there is] borrowing the discipline of Marxism, et cetera, and then, “let’s do it.” That is kind of an “ism,” a discipline of “ism”. Did you see the latest issue of Time magazine? The Vatican, the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church, is [issuing a] warning, because in El Salvador a Catholic priest is trying to create something liberated, free from the pressure or suffering from the government, from fighting, et cetera, using the idea of action. That idea of action is against hierarchies, and also [is in the] liberal style of Catholic teaching. So they try to do something against the traditional hierarchy, and also [in the] liberal Catholic style. Very naturally, how can you serve the people who suffer from government, et cetera? You cannot save them by hierarchy, or teaching, et cetera, so they try to do something by action. But the Vatican is warning the priest that that idea of teaching is based on the principles of Marxism. I don’t know what’s going on there, but the Vatican says it in that way. 

So action is important for us, but action shouldn’t be based on any “ism”. Your action must be pure; in order to make your action pure, your action must be based on emptiness. It is pretty difficult to do that. It’s pretty difficult to act on the basis of emptiness, because if you act, very naturally act follows thinking, judging, evaluation, and next moment, [there are] affective preferences. So [it’s] very difficult; that’s why action itself must be free, liberated. [If] you want to act in order to get something by your action, your action must be liberated. How? That’s a pretty difficult practice for us! That’s why we’re always practicing like this, learning the teaching. You cannot just act as you like; no, you cannot act in that way. 

#### 28:48

So very naturally [Dogen Zenji says], “Observing the body is body observing.” Observing the tape recorder, *who* observes? Finally, nothing. Right in the realm of nothing – and then something appears. In the world of nothing, it’s not nothing; simultaneously [something] comes up. That is a creation: something comes up. So if you see the something created, so-called *I*, and then *I* observe, only *I* appears. *I* observe *I*. That’s it! And then, all sentient beings support *me*, support my observation. 

So first of all you have to see the total dynamic working inter-opened by the front and back of the maple leaf, constantly. And then within the world of total dynamic working, then something happens. That is showing the [back], [in one] moment. And then that [back] is [an] occurrence within our cognition. Then we say: “Yes, maple leaf.” But that maple leaf is seen only from the back, so it’s not the total picture. It’s like you take a picture of the back of the maple leaf, and then you say “this is a maple leaf.” Of course [it is] a maple leaf, but the maple leaf is seen from just one side; that is called the back, or the front. That is always our understanding. If you judge it, [...] that is a sense of value we always have. Our sense of value is important, but it’s very narrow, very shaky. That sense of value we have is always kind of a troublemaker. 

The important point is, if you see the back of the maple leaf, you shouldn’t judge the life of the maple leaf in terms of the back, but through the back of the maple leaf you have to see the total picture of the maple leaf. That is functioning, the entire world: total dynamic working. We should understand this. It means we should understand the total picture of the maple leaf interacting between the front and the back through only the back, because the back appears. At that time, only the back appears, that’s it, no front. 

So that is “observing the body is body observing”. Observation observes observation, because the entire world is interacting. Total dynamic acting. So observation observes observation; that means completely observation leaves no trace of observation. Body observes body. The back observes the back. The front observes the front. That’s it. So you can say *observation of the body*, and next moment *the body observing*, you can say so. 

So you can say Dainin Katagiri, and also you can say Minnesota-Zen-Meditation-Center-and-Katagiri, or Katagiri-and-Minnesota-Zen-Meditation-Center, because Meditation Center and Katagiri are the same. Observation and the body are the same, body and observation are the same, because my body is exactly observation. Nothing else. So that’s why it says, “not the observation of other things.” Just observation there. Observation means the action or total dynamic working that’s there.

#### 35:26

> The observation at the very moment is far and away the most excellent occurrence. 

At this very moment, observation is very excellent. No comparison. Just total dynamic working there. But total dynamic working consists of the idea of front and back. But right in the middle of total dynamic working, you cannot pin down what is front or back, because it’s working. So it’s really something alive, that is called “far and away the most excellent occurrence.” Constantly going.
