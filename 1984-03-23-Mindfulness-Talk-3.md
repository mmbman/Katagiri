### Part 1

<a href="https://www.mnzencenter.org/the-dainin-katagiri-audio-archive/track-1-of-29220017" target="_blank">Listen to Part 1 of this talk on mnzencenter.org</a> 

Let me read the next part:

> Observing the body is body observing, that is not the observation of other things. The observation at the very moment is far and away the most excellent occurrence. When body observing is manifested, mind observing cannot be groped and found, nor manifested. Therefor it becomes ... samadhi and ... samadhi, both are observation of the body as not-pure. The principle behind Shakyamuni’s sighting of the morning star at dawn is called observing the body as not-pure. It is beyond a matter of drawing comparison between purity and impurity. It is body-being-is-not-pure, or body-manifesting-is-not-pure. 

Probably you don’t understand what it says. Even in Japanese, we don’t understand he wants to say. 

I translated it a different way from this version. This translation tries to translate the original, which he wants readers to understand if they read. That’s very compassionate, very kind. But at that time, that translation goes completely far from the original, because Dogen Zenji uses terms, for instance “body-being-is-not-pure” as one word, not separately. And body-manifesting-is-not-pure [is] also one word. Each word has very profound meaning. If you try to translate it in plain words in order to make people understand through your knowledge, completely its far from the original. Even though in Japanese we don’t understand this one, each term he uses has a reason why he used it. And it has very profound meaning. That’s why I translate it in a different way, even though you don’t understand it. But it’s a very interesting thing which happens always in *Shobogenzo*. So that’s why people don’t understand. And if people don’t understand it, we try to make the *Shobogenzo* read in an easy way. But if you do it, the translation becomes very shallow. You can convey Dogen’s thought, or religion, in a sense, but in a very shallow way, through translation. Through modern Japanese it’s pretty difficult to translate it into English or into modern Japanese *[he laughs]* – it’s pretty hard. So that’s why we have to face directly the original text, and then understand it, or try to understand. That’s pretty important. For century after century, many priests and monks have done it in that way.

> Observing the body is body observing that is not observation of other things.

We have to see something alive with your body, and with the observation or contemplation, not the idea of something particular. Through your body and mind, through your activity, you have to find something *alive* in human life, in everyday life. That’s the point that Dogen Zenji always tries to say. So through the practice of mindfulness, we have to find something alive, beyond the idea of mindfulness. If we say, “Let’s practice mindfulness,” you always try to concentrate on the breath, and then you say, “I have completed the practice of mindfulness.” I don’t think so! That is you have an idea of mindfulness for a certain period of time, in a certain area, so-called *breath*. No. Next moment, right after breath, you have to return to everyday life, and then the mindfulness is completely gone. You don’t know how to practice mindfulness. So real mindfulness, you have to find something really vividly alive with your body. That mindfulness means real mindfulness beyond mindfulness, beyond the idea of mindfulness. We say mindfulness-and-no-mindfulness. You should be free from mindfulness, anyway. *Free from* means your body must be mindfulness, exactly. *Freedom*, liberation, means your body and the idea of mindfulness become one, and also practice and you must be one. Your thinking must be one with mindfulness. Anyway, all becomes one with mindfulness, that is called *mindfulness*. How can you leave the trace of mindfulness there? No. Because the whole world, your body, your mind, becomes completely filled with mindfulness. And your circumstances are completely filled with mindfulness. Everywhere, mindfulness. If so, do we have to emphasize particularly strongly “I am doing mindfulness”? No. No idea. That’s why very naturally the idea of mindfulness drops off. That is called *no mindfulness*, or open-hearted, open mindfulness. Or freedom, liberation of the mindfulness. That is called no mindfulness. 

“Not-pure”: I use not-pure this time instead of impure. I think not-pure is better, because not as a negative expression means your life and tree’s life and all sentient beings are completely embraced by the same-and-one-nature, so-called Buddha Nature or whatever you say. If everything is completely filled with the-same-and-one nature, at that time it’s not necessary to emphasize a particular time so-called “the-same-and-one-nature” because everything is one nature. So very naturally the idea of the same and one nature drops off. That is called no-buddha-nature. So Buddha Nature means completely pure, the whole world is filled with purity. At that time, everyone is pure, beyond pure and not-pure. At that time, whatever you pick up, it is pure. If so, it’s not necessary to say “I am practicing purity.” No. So the idea of purity drops off; that is called not-pure. We say *not-purity*. 

Not-purity means negating purity, but this not-pure means the spirit of being filled with purity. At that time, no purity. That is called not-pure. At that time you [can] find something alive. You can taste, you can experience something alive. That is your body; you have to find it within your body, with your body, and you have to find it through the practice of observation, contemplation, or mindfulness. 

So not the idea of mindfulness, because observation... Let me say observation is completely pure, perfectly pure, beyond purity or impurity. Why? Because if you contemplate or if you observe something, your object, you observe your object. That is the dualistic sense; very common. And then you judge immediately; think something. That is really taking care of human life according to the one-way traffic. You never think two-way traffic. Because if you observe your object, the object observes you. In other words, you are *observed* by your object. That is subject and object; subject and object are always interacting like this, simultaneously. But our sense is always set up subject and object as separate, and next moment, we don’t see that interaction, but in the next moment we judge it by our customs or patterns of thinking. So that’s why next moment we stumble. 

So Buddhism always sees that subject and object, because this is a very natural situation, but instead of judging, instead of seeing something and judging it, being judged by your sense. Anyway, see something alive between, how subject and object working together. That is interpenetration, or interdependence, we say. 

Yesterday I told you the poem composed by Ryokan: “A maple leaf, showing its back and its front. It is falling.” So the back and front is subject and object, in other words the dualistic world. The idea of maple leaf, so-called life and death, is nothing but front and back, dualistic world. If you think it. If you think, very naturally, showing the front, showing the back. But you cannot judge the life of the maple leaf in terms of just the front, when it appears. No. Next moment, the front disappears and the back appears. And you cannot say, finally you don’t know the life of the maple leaf: is it the front? Or is it the back? No. Always front and back, front and back, interactive. And then that is what? Action. Activity, motion. That is something alive, the life of the maple leaf. So it doesn’t stop even for a moment; it’s always going like this. 

Finally, you don’t know what the maple leaf is. Maple leaf just functions; total dynamic working; that’s it. But if you think it, if you judge it, if you make a choice of your life, very naturally you can, “It’s the back,” “It’s the front.” But that is a philosophical idea, biological idea, and psychological idea. But something alive within the life of maple leaf is always moving. And acting, functioning, constantly. 

So finally, I observe tape recorder. Tape recorder observes me. Who observes? I observe? No. Tape recorder observes me? If so, if I see the state of the observation, at that time can I say, “I observe tape recorder?” No; completely no. Or, tape recorder observes me? No. So what is the real observation? Real observation is just total dynamic working between tape recorder and I. And then if I think it, and if I think that state of the observation in terms of the particular angle, so-called *I*, *I* observe, just *I*, not tape recorder, *I*. Tape recorder observes tape recorder. Because between the tape recorder and I, always interacting. So you cannot separate, you cannot analyze between the tape recorder and I, right in the middle of the total dynamic working of tape recorder and I. No; it’s just like the maple leaf. So that is observation. Observation is completely oneness, and oneness is emptiness, nothing to pin down. That is called the-same-and-one-nature. So the front of the maple leaf is always facing you in the realm of the-same-and-one-nature, front is always working in the realm of the-same-and-one-nature. What is this? What is the functioning, what is the total dynamic working of the maple leaf? That is called emptiness. 

Yesterday I told you liberation comes from action. But don’t misunderstand this action. That action must be based on emptiness. Don’t expect something liberated by the practice of liberation, by the practice of your action. No, because your action must be liberated. So if you say “by my action I want to create something liberated,” that is already separate. So no communication there, because *you try* to create something, always you are going out. So you don’t look at yourself. Always you going out means you are empty how? ... So you’re always trying to get some ideas in order to justify yourself, that’s why ... the teaching, discipline of Marxism, et cetera *[He laughs.]* And then, “let’s do it.” That is kind of “ism”, discipline of ism. Recently you can see the Time magazine. Did you see the latest issue? Vatican Warning - Vatican headquarters of the Roman Catholics is warning because in El Salvador, over there in South Africa, a Catholic priest tried to create something liberated, being free from pressure or suffering by government, or by fighting, et cetera, using the idea of action. That idea of action is against hierarchies, and also liberal side of Catholic teaching. So they try to do something against the traditional hierarchy, and also liberal Catholic style. So very naturally, how can you serve the people who suffer from government, et cetera? You cannot save them by heirarchty, or teaching, et cetera, so they try to do something by action. But the Vatican is warning the priest that idea of teaching is based on principle of Marxism. I don’t know what’s going on there, that the Vatican says in that way. 

So action is important for us, but action shouldn’t be based on any “ism”. Your action must be pure. In order to be pure, in order to make your action pure, action must be based on emptiness. That is pretty  difficult, to do that. It’s pretty difficult to act on the basis of emptiness, because if you act, very naturally act follows thinking, judging, evaluation, and next moment, [there are] affective preferences. So very difficult; that’s why action et cetera must be free, liberation. So you want to act in order to get something by your action, if so, your action must be liberated. How? That’s a pretty difficult practice for us. That’s why we’re always practicing like this, learning the teaching. So you cannot just act as you like; no, you cannot act in that way. 

Very naturally observing the body is body observing. Dogen Zenji mentions that observing the tape record is who observes? Finally, nothing. Right in the realm of nothing, and then something appears. In the world of nothing, it’s not nothing; it comes up. Simultaneously it comes up. That is a creation; something comes up. So if you see the something created, so called ... then I observe, only I appears. I observe I. That’s it. And then all sentient beings support me, support my observation. 

So first of all you have to see that total dynamic working inter-opened by the front and back of the maple leaf, constantly. And then within this, within the world of total dynamic working, then something happens. That is showing the front. ... moment. And then that front is occurance within our condition. Then we say, “Yes, maple leaf.” But that maple leaf is only from the back, so it’s not the total picture. It looks like you take a picture of the back of the maple leaf, and then you say “this is a maple leaf.” Of course [it is] a maple leaf, but maple leaf is seen from just one side. That is called the back, or the front. That is our understanding, always. If you judge it, that is a sense of value you have always. That’s why our sense of value is important but it’s very narrow, very shaky. That sense of value we have is always kind of a troublemaker. 

The important point is, if you see the back of the maple leaf, you shouldn’t judge the life of the maple leaf in terms of the back, but through the back of the maple leaf you have to see the total picture of the maple leaf. That is functioning, the entire world. Total dynamic working. We should understand this. IT means we should understand the total picture of the maple leaf interacting between the front and the back, through only the back, because the back appears there. At that time, only the back appears, that’s it, no front. So that is observing the body is body observing. 

Observation observes observation, because the entire world is interacting. Total dynamic acting. So observation observes observation. It means completely observation leaves no trace of observation. That means observation observes observation. Body observes body. The back observes the back. The front observes the front. That’s it. So you can say observation the body, next moment the body observing, you can say so. 

So Dainin Katagiri, you can say so, and also Minnesota Zen Meditation Center and Katagiri, or Katagiri and Minnesota Zen Meditation Center, you can say so. Because Meditation Center and Katagiri are the same. Observation and the body are the same; body and observation the same. Because my body is exactly observation. So nothing else, that’s why here it says “not the observation of other things.” Just observation there. Observation means action, activities, or total dynamic working, that’s there.

> The observation at the very moment is far and away the most excellent occurrence. 

At this very moment, observation is very excellent. No comparison. Just total dynamic working there. But total dynamic working consists of the idea of front and back. But right in the middle of total dynamic working, you cannot pin down what is front or back, because it’s working. So it’s really something alive, that is called “far and away the most excellent occurrence.” Constantly going.
