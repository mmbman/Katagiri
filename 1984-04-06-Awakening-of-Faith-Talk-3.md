I want to get into Part 3, omitting Part 1 and Part 2, because... well, sometimes I will explain Part 2 and Part 1. Particularly Part 3 is very important, “Interpretation.” This is the main subject. More than half of this book is spent explaining the contents of this discourse. 

So I want to start to study from Part 3, “Interpretation.” This is very logical explanation of Buddhism, the “Interpretation.”

> PART 3.  
> Interpretation  
>
> The part on outline has been given; next the part on interpretation [of the principle of Mahayana] will be given. It consists of three chapters: (1) Revelation of the True Meaning; (2) Correction of Evil Attachments; (3) Analysis of the Types of Aspiration for Enlightenment.

I gave you the diagram. Do you have this? I think you should bring this diagram too, alright?

So the interpretation is divided into three chapters. One is “Revelation of the True Meaning”, second, “Correction of Evil Attachments”, third, “Analysis of the Types of Aspiration for Enlightenment.” 

“The part on outline has been given”: I think this is page 28 of part 2, “Outline.” So this is the part on outline has been given, next the part on interpretation. This is Interpretation. 

> CHAPTER ONE  
> Revelation of True Meaning  

Revelation of true meaning means, I think, here in this, logically speaking in this chapter, this author tried to explain the meaning of Mahayana teaching. Mahayana means, I told you Mahayana means universal dynamic working. This is Mahayana. Not Mahayana opposed to Hinayana. So the title of this book is Awakening of Faith, but strictly speaking this is the awakening of Mahayana faith. *Mahayana faith*, not faith *in* Mahayana. Mahayana faith, the original text says Mahayana faith in the Outline. So I think not, here it says The Awakening of Faith, but sometimes in this translation it says Awakening of Faith in Mahayana. *[Negatory sound.]* (*Transcriber’s Note:* This is interesting; I don’t think I’ve ever heard Katagiri Roshi make a sound like “bleh” before.) [But] it's not *in* Mahayana, [it’s] *Mahayana faith*, because faith must be dynamic working, reaching to the limits of phenomena, the limits of human knowledge. At that time you can touch the very core of existence.

So, that is at that time it is called dynamic working, truth. So that [...] by “Revelation of True Meaning” is, they try to explain the *real* meaning of Mahayana teaching. Or concretely speaking, particularly in our life, in terms of our life, revelation of the true meaning means, [...] what is overall picture of your life. Simply speaking, reality, you say: real reality. Real reality, overall picture of reality. What is the overall picture of reality you are present in, from moment to moment. That is *revelation*, “Revelation of True Meaning”. So this is the title of chapter one.

And then, this chapter one is also divided into two sections, one is called “One Mind and Its Two Aspects,” ... no, excuse me, the mind in terms of the truth, no, excuse me, I am confused, excuse me. Let me read, alright, sorry, number one, “One Mind and Its Two Aspects.” 

> The revelation of the true meaning [of the principle of Mahayana can be achieved by unfolding the doctrine] that the principle of One Mind has two aspects. One is the aspect of Mind in terms of the Absolute [(tathata; Suchness)], and the other is the aspect of Mind in terms of phenomena [(samsara; birth and death)]. Each of these two aspects embraces all states of existence. Why? Because these two aspects are mutually inclusive.

The last sentence is translated as in a different way, according to D.T. Suzuki he says, "Both are so closely interrelated that one cannot be separated from the other." 

Well, anyway, “The revelation of the true meaning by that the principle of One Mind has two aspects”: In this case the principle [is] *dharma*. *Dharma* is translated as “the principle” here, in this translation. So, “Dharma of One Mind.” 

Look at page 28, Part 2, and the third paragraph: 

> The principle is "the Mind of the sentient being". This Mind includes in itself all states of being of the phenomenal world and the transcendental world. On the basis of this Mind, the meanings of Mahayana may be unfolded. 

“The principle” in this case also refers to *dharma*. “The dharma is the mind of the sentient being. This mind includes in [itself] all states of being of the phenomenal world and the transcendental world. On the basis of this mind the meanings of Mahayana may be unfolded.” 

This statement is described in detail in this paragraph I read, “One Mind and Two Aspects.” So that's why here it says, "The revelation of the true meaning by that principle, the Dharma of the One Mind has two aspects." So from this point, *One Mind* means *Dharma*. One Mind is Dharma, Dharma is One Mind. One Mind means universal entity. You can say *absolute*, you can say *truth*. 

In the Avatamsaka school, Avatamsaka Sutra, we say *Mind Only*. Mind Only this is also One Mind, same meaning [as] One Mind. The teaching of the Mind Only comes from this, *The Awakening of Faith*. So this book has a lot of teachings. Zen teaching are also here. This book tried to collect the essence of the Buddhist teaching. So from this book, the Shin school comes out, Zen comes out from this teaching, Avatamsaka Sutra, and also Buddhist psychology also. So this book is kind of a, what would you say, “digest” of Buddhist teaching. That's why it is very popular, this book is very popular. 

So usually One Mind is understood as philosophical sense, the absolute in the philosophical sense. But here it says One Mind, Dharma, is the mind of the all sentient beings. So not ontological, philosophical sense. Dharma is not philosophical sense, but that is the mind of the all sentient beings. So that means all of us. So Dharma or One Mind is the mind of all sentient beings, the core mind of all of us. 

So [it comes] very close. If you understand One Mind as philosophical or psychological, it's kind of an idea. But if you understand One Mind as the mind of all sentient beings, it comes very close. 

That's why in Part Two, first of all it says Dharma is the mind of all sentient beings. This is very important. 

And also this One Mind [unfolds] Mahayana teaching. So all Mahayana teaching comes from One Mind. That is whatever you say, idealistically – you say truth, or the buddha-nature, or dharma-nature, or tathagata garbha, you know, whatever you say – but it *comes from*, the Mahayana teaching comes from the mind of all sentient beings. That teaching comes from all of you, from your life. That's why here it says “the Dharma is the mind of all sentient beings.” 

That's why I [always say] Buddha’s teaching is human life. It's not philosophy. It's philosophy because life is very complicated. That's why we have to understand it as best as we can. In order to explain, in order to understand the human life philosophically, psychologically, well, it becomes very complicated. But it's really connected with human life. 

If you don't understand the philosophical aspect of Buddhist teaching in relation with human life, it's nothing but, what would you say, metaphysical, philosophical. It’s just ideas. 

When I went to the university, a teacher always teaches us, all the teachers gave a lecture on the Majadakas, and the Avatamsaka Sutras, and emptiness – whatever they taught us, all of their teaching was really cold. Their teaching had nothing to do with our lives. 

So [...] when the truth is seen in terms of, what would you say, in terms of phenomenal world, the phenomenal world of human suffering, in other words, the samsaric world, truth is called “the mind of all sentient beings.” But, when the truth is seen from the absolute, no delusions, no confusions, etc., that is, it is called, One Mind, we say One Mind. So, there are many words there, but, they all have the same meaning. But when the truth is seen from a different angle, that time, truth has different words. One Mind, the mind of all sentient beings, or *tathagatagarbha* means you have buddha-nature, you are already buddha-nature, buddha. This is *tathagatagarbha*. You are already *stored*. *Garbha* means “storage.” “Dharma container,” your body is dharma container, *garbha*. *Tathagata* means *buddha*. 

#### 20:18

So, the principle, that dharma “of One Mind has two aspects. One is the aspect of Mind in terms of the Absolute...” so-called truth. “... and the other is the aspect of Mind in terms of phenomena.” 

So, phenomena and truth. One Mind has two aspects. In other words, one piece of paper with two aspects, one is the absolute or truth, the other is phenomena. 

And also, each of these two aspects embraces all states of existence. Each of these aspects, these two aspects, the absolute and phenomena, embraces all sentient beings. So that means [the] real reality we live, from day to day, is called One Mind in terms of the absolute. So real reality is complete absolute, completely no comment. Constantly you are there, whatever you may go. You make a mistake, you don't make a mistake, or crying, laughing, whatever you say, you are doing right in the middle of real reality based on One Mind. This is philosophically we say, One Mind. 

Then we act. When we act, we think, we cry, we suffer, many things. This is the phenomenal world. So the phenomenal world is always going in the realm of the absolute. Nowhere to escape [to]. 

So this is the very important outlook on human life, the human world. Whatever you think – tape recorder, microphone, trees, birds, winters, whatever you think – anyway, all sentient beings exist just like this. So, you should have outlook on human life, human world according to this teaching. 

That's why here it says, “Each of these two aspects embraces all state of existence.”

“Why? because these two aspects are mutually inclusive.”
 
Inclusive: you cannot separate them. They are two, but they are not two, they are one. But it's not one; if you say one it seems to be combined, two things. It’s not combination of two things. That is a little difficult understanding. But philosophically, intellectually you can understand it. But no one knows, [...] it is very difficult for us to find a way how to live in that real reality on the basis of interrelated way, truth, and phenomena. It's pretty difficult. 

Not only Buddhism, but according to Western philosophy, or many philosophers anyway, explain the truth and phenomena. But it's very difficult to find philosophers to teach us how to live, how to dwell in there constantly, how to act, how to live in peace and harmony. It's pretty hard. 

But Buddhism anyway constantly teaches us that point. That's why from this point, the goal of Buddhism is not understanding the meaning of liberation or the experience of liberation, it's not the final goal. The final goal is the understanding liberation, experience of liberation, but you have to have deep compassion to help all sentient beings on the basis of liberation. This is called liberation. You have to help. 

So that is because, if you become a liberation, very naturally you can help. This is *real* liberation. But if you don't help all sentient beings, even though you understand, even though you experience liberation, it doesn't make sense. 

So, the final goal of Buddhism is anyway understanding, experiencing liberation, but you have to put it into practice, in order to help all sentient beings. That is the final goal. So finally, right in the middle of the practice of helping all sentient beings, completely no idea of, no perception of liberation. You should forget it. You have to be free from liberation, and *then* you can help. 

So that's why always there is a negative expression there: no help, no liberation. Ok? That is called *nirvana*, we say nirvana. *Nirvana* is final liberation, completely final liberation. So, enlightenment and nirvana is according to the universe, nirvana is kind of a black hole, you know? *[He chuckles.]* Enlightenment, delusions, sufferings, and pleasures, all stuff are completely sucked in and disappear. Nevertheless, you are really working there. 

But if you experience nirvana, if you think something like that, the people are scared. If I say “nirvana is a black hole,” you are scared, you are afraid of that. But in terms of spiritual life, I don't think you disappear. You appear, conspicuously, more than before, very clearly. Your consciousness works very clearly and you can act very clearly, stably. But no perceptions, no ideas. Your everyday life is really working. 

So, that's why [it says], “because these two aspects are mutually inclusive.”

So I think in order to understand the human world, human beings, you should keep in mind this point, phenomena and truth are interactive, interpenetrated, interdependent, constantly. So that is totally, as a whole, we say *dynamic working*. 

That is just like kind of a statue of the Buddha made of gold. And if you see this statue, maybe you say [it’s] gold. Yes, it's gold. But on the other hand, someone says it's a Buddha statue, because it's a Buddha statue. Whatever you say, it hits the mark, because it's a Buddha statue. But on the other hand, it is gold. So even though you say “gold,” it's right. Because the Buddha statue is made of gold. So whatever part of the Buddha statue is taken by you, it's gold. But without gold, you cannot make the Buddha statue. 

The Buddha statue is the phenomenal world, the gold is truth, us. One Mind. The mind of all sentient beings. Your basic nature is exactly gold. 

And then that gold and Buddha statue are exactly one. You cannot separate it. So without it, without the gold, without the absolute or the mind of all sentient beings, without buddha-nature, without truth – you cannot exist, just like Roger, just like Katagiri. No. Just like table. This is a very important point. If you try to understand the people and things, material beings, whatever it is, in appropriate way, you should keep this point in mind. Without the truth, you cannot exist, you cannot take a certain form, so-called Roger, so-called Katagiri, so-called table. You cannot think it, you cannot exist. It's impossible. That's why this book always mention this point. 

#### 32:55

[...] And also, you know, here it says, “two aspects are mutually inclusive.” Temporarily I can say so like this. [The] limits of suffering, limits of phenomena, limits of knowledge, limits of treasure, whatever you say, limits of suffering is the beginning of vastness, the truth, exactly. The limits of suffering is beginning of vastness or truth or one mind, universe. So “limits of the suffering” means if you experience suffering through and through, you cannot cry, sometimes you can burst out laughing. *[He chuckles.]* So the limits of suffering is not suffering, completely not suffering. It's something else. So maybe laughing. And the limits of laughter becomes suffering, crying, like this. Because limits of joy is beginning of vastness, because end of the joy is completely extending everywhere. So that is vastness. That is called beginning of the vastness, so-called truth. 

Everyone experiences like this. For instance, in 1960s and 70s in San Francisco lots of things happened. I knew there were a couple of people who were really mental disordered. In a sense, one man suffered a lot. Well I don't know if he suffered in appropriate way or not, anyway he suffered, and then several times he was in the hospital, coming out, getting in again, and there was always back and forth, back and forth. And he seemed to be sad. Very often he cried. But when he was completely disordered, he became laughter. Completely he laughed, he didn't cry. 

Then that means he already get into vastness of existence. But the point is, he didn't realize. He didn't realize vastness or truth, he didn't realize the phenomenal world, he didn't realize end of the phenomenal world, end of the suffering, limits of suffering. He didn't realize. That is the point, alright? That's why here it says we should realize this one. When you realize, when you view human life, the human world according to this teaching, and practice on an everyday basis, if you practice like this, very naturally you can realize. Okay? You can realize, you can attain a certain stage of the spiritual life. At that time, end of the suffering, you can cry. End of the suffering, you can cry, but through and through, if you cry, completely cry, it turns into laughter, even though at that time you are not mentally disordered. Because you realize, you know pretty well, the relationship between the phenomenal world and the truth. 

In the Zen stories, I think Yakusan Zen Master, when Yakusan Zen Master looked at the moon at night, he became a laughter, great laughter, on the top of the mountains, and that sound of the laughter, anyway, echoed I don't know how many miles. That story is really exaggerated. 20 miles, or more than 20 miles. Anyway, the sound of his laughter echoed 20 miles or 40 miles away. That expression is exaggerated, that means, anyway, the limit of laughter is completely beyond laughing. Because it's penetrated, all over. And the limit of suffering is completely vast. So you cannot cry. 

Yesterday during the last [talk] in Alaska, I mentioned about this. [You know] Miss Universe? Miss Universe always cries at the last scene. *[Laughter.]* It's not the very sad experience, it's a very joyful experience! So why don't you laugh? But she doesn't laugh, she always cries at the last scene. *[He laughs.]* And then one student asked me, in Alaska, she said, even though she cried, that is pretty normal, she has some problem. I said, no problem. Even though she cried, no problem. It's very natural, very natural.

*[Tape break.]*

... in order to get a better life. But on the other hand, you shouldn't commit suicide with your suffering. So you have to take care of suffering day by day. And then you can really understand what the limit of suffering is.

And then the limit of suffering is no more suffering. That's why the Four Noble Truths, it says Four Noble Truths. Truth of the Suffering. And the Buddha says, suffering is due to impermanence, and egolessness is due to suffering. You know, suffering is due to impermanence. It's very interesting. Impermanence is not the idea of change, impermanence is energies which makes the change change, which causes change to change. Alright? That is impermanence, the very basic function of universe. This is temporarily, we say impermanence. That's why Dogen Zenji says, impermanence is buddha-nature.

So on account of the impermanence, there is suffering. So what is suffering? That means the limit of suffering is impermanent. It means suffering is no suffering. 

Why are we suffering? Because it is impermanent. Because it is impermanent, [...] it's very difficult for us to know impermanence, which has no flavors, no smells, no colors, no forms. That's why through the idea of change you can experience in your daily life, we can't realize what impermanence is, what the basis of change is, what the limit of change is. Limit of change or basis of change is completely nothing. You cannot say it's change. Nothing to change; just energies. Just moving.

So that's why Buddha says, on account of impermanence we have a suffering. But the basis of suffering is not suffering, that is impermanence. But in terms of change, that is suffering. Ok? *[He chuckles.]* It's really suffering. But [if] you go through and through into the depths of suffering, it becomes impermanent. 

Also, the egolessness is due to suffering. So [...] on account of suffering we can practice egolessness. It's a very interesting thing: on account of suffering we can practice egolessness. Even though you don't know egolessness, take care of your suffering, through and through, and then you can touch the core of existence, so-called egolessness, nothing. Touch the core of existence on the basis of impermanence. That's why no ego. That's why suffering gives you lots of information, teachings. Very naturally, through the suffering you can get a taste of what the egolessness is. Very naturally.

But still there is a difference between the person who doesn't realize and the person who realizes. That is a *big* difference. That's why we have to practice on a daily basis, and, anyway, realize it, and understand it, digest it, through your body and mind. Otherwise, even though Buddha says, “suffering is due to impermanence,” you understand it, but even though you don't understand it, it doesn't work in your daily life. 

Just like a crazy person’s laughter. At the end of suffering, they laugh. But even though they laugh, they become great laughter, it's not great laughter just like Yakusan Zen Master. Completely different; he is a crazy person.

So you have to realize. That's why it says here, “One Mind is not a philosophical entity.” This is the mind of all sentient beings, all of us. And this One Mind is really something interrelated, interconnected, interdependent with the phenomenal world and truth, constantly. There is no gap between. Temporarily I say “end of the phenomena,” but there is no end. No end and no beginning; constantly working. But temporarily I can say “end of the suffering,” or “limits of the suffering,” “limits of the phenomena,” “limits of knowledge.” 

And then, that is the beginning of the universe. If you come to a dead end, that dead end is not a dead end, it's a beginning, anyway. *[He chuckles.]*

Okay. Do you have questions about this? 

#### 49:20

**Question:** Hojo-san? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** *Hai*.

**Same person:** I was wondering about two things. One is, when you use the term *nirvana*, what is this whole notion of nirvana being like some state that is not ... pure activity, more a state of being off someplace like in a heavenly realm. A common understanding of *nirvana* is sort of more separated from the day to day activity in life.

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yeah. Mm-hmm.

**Same person:** So I was wondering about that. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yeah. Nirvana is misunderstood by many people. By us.

Because nirvana means to *blow out*, or *extinguish*, or *tranquility*; something like this. That's why nirvana refers to as death. But death is life in Buddhism, so nirvana reffered to as death is fine. But death is life in Buddhism, so you understand nirvana extended into human life.

And the Buddha uses the term *nirvana* as the highest level, highest stage of spiritual life, more than enlightenment, or holiness, or supernatural power, something like this. More than this. And then Buddha mentions enlightenment, supernatural power, or holiness, all things comes into nirvana and [are] melted away. This is called *nirvana*. Do you understand? 

So *nirvana* is something more than enlightenment. Something more than a divine state of spiritual life. Okay?

**Same person:** Would you say it's a state of no-enlightenment? 
 
**Katagiri Roshi:** Yeah, no enlightenment, you can say so, yes. 

**Same person:** Just doing.

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yes. You can say so, no enlightenment. But no enlightenment means experience of enlightenment is melted away in the vastness, so-called truth, One Mind. Because always there is one mind. And everything is melted away, constantly. You experience suffering, next moment, it's melted away, just like a drop of dew is falling into the ocean. The moment your drop of dew is falling into the ocean is a reaction: suffering, pleasure, you know? Next moment, it is melted away in the ocean. 

So that is interrelation, interpenetration between truth and the phenomenal world. That's why this is not ideas, this is human life. If you look at human life, you can really realize this. 

So suffering is not always suffering. Through the suffering you can really learn how deep human life is. 

So that is called *nirvana*, we say nirvana. 

**Same person:** Okay, well, why do we call that state of universal reality, or whatever you want to call it, why do we call that state of One Mind? Like why do we use the term *mind* rather than *universal energy* or any other word we can come up with? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Well, *mind*, I don't know, in English “mind” is not... In Chinese or in Japanese, “mind” is a little bit broad. I use “mind” but it's not *mind*. The term *mind* I use is mind including spirit, soul, or psyche – whole stuff. 

**Same person:** But even those are like terms of like human psyche or consciousness. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yes. [...] If you use the term *truth*, or *absolute*, or the *dharma-nature*, that is kind of a philosophical term. But *truth* is not somewhere separate from you, truth is always with us. Anyway, we are living in the realm of truth, wherever you may go. If so, truth is found in us. 

**Same person:** Oh. So mind...

**Katagiri Roshi:** And also, truth is completely beyond your speculation but truth is something we should realize. 

Just like nature. Do you understand nature? Nature is something far from you; you don't understand *real* nature. Because if you understand real nature according to your, what would you say, cognition, you misunderstand nature. So that's why always we destroy nature. But if so, shouldn't we realize nature? If nature is always far from us, we don't have any chance to understand nature, don't you think so? So, nature is something beyond our cognition, but nature should be understood by our cognition. *[He laughs.]* When nature comes into our cognition, mind, at that time we say, "I understand nature." But your understanding of nature is already something special. That's why we have to polish, [make] our understanding [profound]. Okay? 

[...] The same applies to the truth. Truth is completely beyond your control, your speculation. If so, we don't have any chance to experience [it]. But practically, everyone experiences it. From day to day, century after century, many people, many ancestors experience truth. If so, truth is still found in our life, when the truth comes into our life. *Our life* means into the field of human cognition. That means mind. At that time it is called *truth*. 

That's why we use *mind*. Do you understand? It’s alright?

**Same person:** Yes.

**Katagiri Roshi:** So, Buddhism means always, if you say, "there is a something which exists” – when you recognize something as an existence – we always understand that which exists in terms of the function of cognition. Without the function of cognition, we cannot recognize anything; we cannot say, "Roger exists." What I say, if I say, "Roger exists there," that means already there is a communication, in terms of cognition. 

So, not ontological existence. Okay? *[He laughs.]* 

**Same person:** Right. [That’s] the only *real* perspective that you can come at anything with.

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yes. So if you recognize something, always there is a something which exists, always interrelated with you. That is cognition. In the realm of cognition, something exists. We can recognize, we can see that something exists. 

If you ignore this one, your understanding becomes philosophical, ontological. Something like that. But nothing exists without relationship with you. 

So, in Buddhism we say, "all,” “all dharmas.” “All dharmas” are [existence]. So even though you don't see Lebanon, or tiny countries in Europe, still they exist. All are one of the *all beings*, all sentient beings. So those are connected with you. Without you, you cannot say, "All beings." That is a point in Buddhism. 

So that's why we don't discuss the one existence, one being, you know, as ontological or philosophical. Always, at a certain period of time, we explain, but it's not the final goal. The final goal is to understand One Being in the relation with you. 

**Same person:** That does seem unique to Buddhism...

**Katagiri Roshi:** Mm-hmm.

**Same person:**... because other religions don't refer to mind.

**Katagiri Roshi:** No.

**Same person:** ... You know, it's more absolute and ontological. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yeah. Right.

#### 1:02:28

**Question:** Hojo-san? Can you say that the limit of suffering is like being at the end of your tether?

**Katagiri Roshi:** Suffering?

**Same person:** The limit of suffering? Can you say that's like being at the end of your tether?

**Katagiri Roshi:** Temporarily I use “limits of suffering.” Limits of suffering, well, “end of rope” is alright. 

When my mother died, I was 14. I cried. I cried all night. *[He laughs.]* All of a sudden: 180 degree turn over. [Suddenly the] world becomes bright. That means [I realized my] mother [is] with me. But that is at the end of the crying. Crying, crying the whole night... and then something happened. So I didn't feel sad...

So that means the limits of suffering, limits of crying and sadness, is not the sadness. It's vastness. So you don't know. So you experience something more than suffering or sadness. Do you understand what I mean? 

For instance, zazen. Maybe some of you experience [that] you continue to do zazen with pain. Sometimes the pain is gone. I experience [that]. For a certain period of time, the pain is really awful. *[He laughs.]* But if you overcome this, pain is here, but pain doesn't bother you. 

So that is called “no pain, no suffering,” et cetera, according to the sutra. That teaching is really encouraging us to understand suffering or sadness in a broad perspective. Don't accept suffering as simple suffering, all right? Suffering is suffering. That's why you have to do something for it, because suffering is something more than suffering.

#### 1:06:30 

**Question:** Would you say that form or  phenomena equals the truth?

**Katagiri Roshi:** Truth and the phenomena... 

**Same person:** Equal? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Equal? Equal is still, what would you say...  yes, in a sense equal. *[He laughs.]* It's not exactly equal. Maybe you may say so. 

It's not exactly equal. If you say equal, you know, *A* is *A*, *[he laughs,]* something like this, but it's not *A* is *A*. It's different. They are different. 

So it's pretty hard to say. Phenomena. Because truth is, well, next, I think the definition of the truth is explained in the next paragraph. It's very difficult to say, but finally what you can say is, what is just is. *[He laughs.]* You know, trees are trees. That's it. 

Truth is, I always say, *vastness*, [or] *oceans*, like this. And then in the vastness of existence, and then oceans, and [we live] there. Whatever you do, always you do in the realm of the vastness of existence. Just like swimming in the oceans, alone. Completely beyond you survive or you don't survive, or you want to swim or don't want to swim. Complete beyond this, your life is always going. You have to swim. 

That practice tells you the vastness of existence and also cognition of your existence, right in the middle of vastness of the ocean. 

So what makes you understand the vastness of existence, and also each individual? Each individual, your life is right in the middle of vastness. But simultaneously you live in the vastness. How to live? Just swim, beyond survive or not survive, die or whatever. 

That practice is called just oneness. One Mind, we say. Or “the mind of all sentient beings.”

So it's very difficult to say they are equal. No, not equal. But they are not different. They are working together, so they are not different. But they are not equal. 

Still a few minutes. Do you have a question?

**Question:** Hojo-san, you also said [...] understand or experience of liberation, then you can help all sentient beings. I wondered if you don’t understand, or you don’t experience liberation, if you can help all sentient beings. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Well, if you don't understand liberation, you are already in the liberation, so you are already in the middle of buddha, or vastness of existence which is called liberation. Alright? If so, why don't you do something? 

*Liberation* means you have to live with the people, with all sentient beings, in peace and harmony. This is the liberation which you can experience practically. So as best as we can, we try to help. And then, very naturally, you can learn what liberation is.

**Question:** I was thinking that sometimes it seems... You have cautioned us about experiencing or tasting truth and mistaking that for, let's say, *whole* truth. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Whole truth?

**Same person:** Yeah. You said, for example, that the truth, like nature, enters into our cognition, and so we can understand it. And it is nature, or it is truth, but it's already particular, individual [...] truth. It seems to me that would be pretty tricky, it could be a little bit of a problem. I'm reminded, for example, again like I said, the 60s in the Bay Area, San Francisco, and people experimented with drugs, and they would get big insights. And many times they felt already qualified to teach everybody. But they understood [...] the teachers, they knew the whole truth. So I wonder how to be alert to that one. 

**Katagiri:** That's why I mentioned, no matter how long, how often you experience that flashing of lightning, through the nirvana or through zazen, anyway, you always offer that experience to the vastness of existence: that means that any kind of experience must be melted away in vastness. And then at that time, your experience becomes very deep. 

For instance, I mentioned the three types of ripeness, according to the persimmon. First stage of ripeness or maturity is the fruit on the branch. [...] The first lightness or maturity is getting the degree of the university. That is the fruit on the branch. Next, the second maturity is [that] the persimmon must become ripe, become red. That means after graduation, you have to forget your titles and anyway jump into human society, share your life with all sentient beings. At that time, you don't know what to do, because lots of cases come up. And then it is not mature yet. Through this real experience, the third maturity is the persimmon which is completely ripe and falls down to the ground and all the guts come out. That is called final maturity. This is called *liberation*, okat? *Freedom*. 

That's why we say *nirvana*. That is *real* nirvana. *[He laughs.]* All the guts come out. So nothing to be arrogant, nothing to attach to. No corners; no corners of your body, all very smooth. That is [egolessness].
