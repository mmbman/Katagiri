Yesterday I talked about the right entrance of Zazen. Zazen is exactly right entrance. Right entrance is not to learn something step by step, but to emulate, to imitate the ancestors' doings, Buddha's doings exactly. Dogen Zenji's whole life was exactly to imitate, to emulate Buddha's and ancestors' doings. That is his teaching. It's not the parrot's imitation, but human imitation is to emulate ancestors' doings and then you should have your own creative life. Otherwise, the imitation is merely just imitation. That is human life. 

So Dogen Zenji, anyway, his whole life he just emulated buddhas’ and ancestors' life and created his own thought and religious spirit. This is Dogen's very deep understanding and very stable, immovable practice. Open to everyone – beyond sect, beyond religious denominations, beyond races. Whoever you are. 

So his religious life is really creative, very creative, based on very deep understanding. 

So that's why he says *right entrance*. 

Today I think half of answer three is left, so I will read. Beside the question three, I think you remember question three, is, 

> It may be that as the right entrance derives from the right transmission of the Tathagata's wonderful means or from following in the path of the patriarchs, it is truly beyond the minds of ordinary men. Though it may be so, ordinary men believe reciting sutras and *nembutsu* should naturally be causes affecting satori. But to sit idly, doing nothing, how can that be of help in gaining satori? 

I think this question implies that we usually thought there are differences between the ordinary people and also genuine persons, or saints. I think one of the Zen students asked the masters during sesshin in Japan, he said, "Would it be possible for me as an ordinary man to attain enlightenment?" The teacher says, "How coward you are!" Immediately he says so. “How coward you are” means, compare his life with a saint or superiors and to practice to start to do something. He is already coward, because always judging himself and putting himself down, and that is really coward. You cannot go straightaway. So that's why he immediately says, "How coward you are!" 

So all are buddhas, all are enlightened beings, so we can do anything. 

And the second is, in this question that we always believe that just sitting is wasting time. So that is the question. 

So Dogen Zenji says... Yesterday we read in the beginning...

> By picturing as you did a moment ago, the unsurpassed great dharma and the samadhi of the buddhas as sitting idly and doing nothing, you malign the great vehicle. Your illusion is indeed profound. It is like being in the middle of a great ocean and saying there is no water. Thankfully buddhas are already sitting serenely in jijuyu samadhi. Does this not constitute extensive merit? It is to be pitied that your eye is not yet opened, that your mind is still drunk. 
> 
> The spiritual realm of buddhas is totally incomprehensible. It is not to be reached by the workings of the mind, still less can it be known by a man of disbelief or inferior intelligence. Only a person of great capacity based on right faith is able to enter here. Even were a person of disbelief given teachings of it he would find it difficult to receive them. Even on Vulture Peak there were some the Buddha allowed to leave. If right faith arises in your mind, you should practice religious discipline and study under a master. If it doesn't arise you should cease for a while and regret the fact of not receiving the benefits of the Dharma from the past. 
>
> Besides, what do you know of the merits gained by such practices as Sutra recitation and *nembutsu*? To think merely moving your tongue or raising your voice has the merit of Buddha-work is a truly futile notion. To attempt to compare them to the Buddha Dharma makes you all the more remote from it. Moreover, the opening of Sutra books should be to make clear to you that the teachings set forth by the Buddha concerning the principles of the practices for sudden and gradual enlightenment, and to assure realization if you practice according to that teaching. It shouldn't be uselessly to waste yourself in speculations and discriminations and then to liken them to merits that will gain you enlightenment. Intending to attain the Buddha way by foolishly working your lips in incessant thousand or ten thousand-fold recitations is just like pointing the thills of your cart north when you want to go south, or like trying to fit a square piece of wood into a round hole. To read the words unaware of the way of practice is just like reading a medical prescription and overlooking to mix the compounds for it. It will be altogether worthless. Lifting your voice in endless recitations is like the frogs in the spring fields croaking from morning to nightfall, no less than before, without benefit. How much more difficult is it to relinquish such things for those deeply deluded by profit and fame – this because of the extreme profundity of their covetousness. Such people were to be found in ancient times, there is no reason they shouldn't be around today. They are especially pitiful. 
>
> Only you must know without fail that the wondrous dharma of the seven buddhas can be received and maintained with its genuine essence manifested if a practicer whose mind is in accord with enlightenment closely follows and receives the right transmission from a clear-minded master who has attained the way. There is no way for this to be known by a priest who studies only words. Therefore, you should have done with these uncertainties and illusions, negotiate the way in zazen under the guidance of a true teacher, and gain complete realization of *jijuyu samadhi* of the Buddhas. 

Here, Dogen Zenji criticizes very strongly, sharply, sutra recitations or *nembutsu*. Very sharply, saying, “to think merely moving your tongue or raising your voice has the merit of Buddha work is truly futile notion.” Or he says, “it is lifting your voice in endless recitation is like the frogs in the spring fields croaking from morning to nightfall – no less than before, without benefit.” It seems to criticize *nembutsu*, Pure Land school, and other Buddhists. But truly, strictly speaking, it is not criticizing the existing Pure Land school, or the founder of the Pure Land school, but people who practice *nembutsu*, chanting a sutra recitation, without devoting fully themselves to recite the name of Amitabha. Then those people criticize the people who set in the zazen with *shikantaza*, just sitting, saying that is a wasting time. Then Dogen Zenji criticized those people who criticize zazen which seems to be a waste of time, because they didn't understand their own practice, reciting *nembutsu*. 

So I think Dogen Zenji tried to wake them up, how they should practice the sutra recitation or chanting the name of Amitabha. He tried to wake them up, what you are doing. How it depends on the degree, how the intention they have in order to chant the name of Amitabha. They truly have to devote themselves to chanting exactly, just like shikantaza. 

But they don't do it, because they don't understand the just sitting. They don't understand the just sitting. Just sitting is not just sitting. Usually people believe just sitting is totally manifestation of the Buddha’s world, without leaving any trace of the self consciousness, beyond time. This is zazen, shikantaza. But people don't understand this one. That's why those people who chant the name of Amitabha criticize the Zen student who sits with wholeheartedness like this. That's why Dogen Zenji tried to wake them up. 

Chanting the name of Amitabha is not different from shikantaza. It's exactly the same. But if you criticize shikantaza, you don't understand your practice. In other words, if I criticize somebody, “you are stupid.” *Who* is stupid? *I* am stupid, already, because I see him in terms of my views. That's why first I must be stupid, and then I can see them as stupid. But if I am generous and magnanimous, compassionate, well, I can accept them. So I cannot say “stupid.” 

So if they criticize always “zazen is exactly wasting time,” it is exactly the same as his practice, his practice is exactly wasting time. That's why Dogen Zenji says here, “just croaking in the spring field.” Nothing else. 

But usually people [mist]understand this paragraph, always criticizing *nembutsu* and Shin school. But I don't think Dogen Zenji criticized practice of *nembutsu* or the Shin school founded by Shinran in Japan. Shinran himself, anyway, devoted himself to chant exactly. 

So Dogen's criticism is quite different from, always try to wake up people who criticizing the Zen Buddhism or Shakyamuni or whoever they are. 

And next, finally he says, 

> How much more difficult is it to relinquish such things for those deeply deluded by profit and fame. 

Always we are doing something with, together, with the desire of getting the fame and profit, together. And then you are excited to do something. If there is no sense of desire with profit and fame, you don't want to do. So if you really try to do something in order to get the profit and fame, I think you don't understand this kind of Buddhist practice, just sitting. That's why Dogen Zenji says, “How much more difficult is it to relinquish such things for these deeply deluded by profit and fame.” Profit and fame means human beings always do something with desire together, to get fame, profit, or satisfying self-consciousness, always. To please the self. Constantly. 

> ... this because of extreme profundity of their covetousness.

This is really human beings. That's why the more organization is famous and known well, very naturally there are lots of temptations of desire, to get the fame and profit, et cetera. So very naturally they don't understand the *real* spirit of Buddha’s teaching. They *believe* that they understand the Buddhism, they teach the Buddhism, but completely off. But they don't see it. 

> Such people were to be found in ancient times, there is no reason they shouldn't be around today. They are especially pitiful. 

That's why, anyway, be careful to practice Buddha’s teaching. 

So finally, what we should do. So next, he mentions 

> Only you must know without fail that the wondrous dharma of the seven buddhas can be received and maintained with its genuine essence manifested if a practicer whose mind is in accord with enlightenment closely follows and receives the right transmission from a clear-minded master who has attained the way.

Very naturally, it is necessary for us to practice under the guidance of a great teacher, because Dogen Zenji experienced very strongly, profoundly when he met his teacher in China. So how important it was for him, for everyone. That's why he mentioned here, 

> There is no way for this to be known by a priest who studies only words. Therefore, you should have done with these uncertainties and illusions, negotiate the way in zazen under the guidance of a true teacher, and gain complete realization of *jijuyu samadhi* of the Buddhas. 

#### 23:27

And next, question four. 

> The teachings of both the Hokke

Hokke means the schools of the Lotus Sutra. 

> The teachings of both the Hokke and Kegong schools, 

Kegong means the Avatamsaka Sutra. 

> ... Kegong schools that have been transmitted in Japan to the present time are the ultimate of the Mahayana teachings. Need I mention teachings like that of the Shingon

Shingon sacred tantric school, 

> Shingon sect which was transmitted personally by Vairochana Buddha to Vajrasattva, and thus handed down from master to disciple without alteration, centering its exposition upon the sayings "the mind in itself is Buddha" and "this very mind attains Buddhahood." It teaches that the genuine enlightenment of the five Buddhas is attained in a single sitting, without going through many kalpas of practice. It could perhaps be termed the Buddha Dharma's utmost sublimity. In light of this, what are the advantages of the practice you now speak of, that you advance it alone, ignoring all others? 

This is also a pretty common question most people have, even now. If you emphasize shikantaza always, without learning anything, how can we save all sentient beings? There are many beings who starve to death. So all we have to do is to sit down here? So many people have questions. It's ridiculous. So we should go somewhere to save somebody else. Or we should participate in peace work, etc. 

It is true, it is fine. But a question is, Dogen Zenji mentions in his answer, it is not a matter of discussion, which of two is important. Point is, wherever you may be, how you should do it. How much your intention is there, in your practice. 

So, answer four... Excuse me, before that, Shingon, I need to mention teaching that of Shingon sect, here it says Hokke, Lotus Sutra, which means Tendai sect, Tientai sect, based on the teaching of Lotus Sutra, which emphasizes all three vehicles are one. Shravaka, pratika and bodhisattva all are one. No discrimination between. And that is Hokke or Tendai teaching, and then according, based on, on the basis on the teaching of Lotus Sutra, Tientai school establishes its own teaching, that is the Tendai school. And the Kegon school is based on the Avatamsaka Sutra, which mentions about the Vairochana Buddha, who is the center of the universe. And all sentient beings emerges from illumination of the Vairochana Buddha. Just like ... sometimes you can see the lake of moon in the morning covered with mist or fog. You cannot see the other shores. But when the fog, sun, decreasing, and then the other shore trees gradually coming up, that emerges from mist. Vairochana Buddha is not a certain creator, who creates all sentient beings. No. So that's why Vairochana, all sentient beings emerges from the illumination, the light of the Vairochana Buddha. When the Vairochana Buddha illuminates, shines its own daylight. In other words, Vairochana light illumination gives forth, and then within the illumination of his power or influence, then all sentient beings emerge from that. In other words, already all sentient beings exist, the moment when Vairochana Buddha exists. So around the Vairochana Buddha, huge universe exists. And within the universe, huge beings exist. And then when Vairochana Buddha gives forth his light, then all sentient beings emerges from this illumination. That's just like, you can see the other shore trees, the houses, from decreasing the fog in the morning. So that is Vairochana Buddha. Vairochana Buddha in the center of the universe. 

And also [...] Shingon school, I think Shingon tantric Buddhism was really established in Japan. And so they emphasize that the Shingon school is transmitted from Vairochana Buddha to Vajrasattva, Vajrasattva and the Nagarjuna and to Kobo Kukai, founder of the Shingon school in Japan. So their lineage is exactly transmitted from generation to generation, that they emphasize. 

So that's why it is very nice Buddhism, very nice Buddhism. 

> It teaches that the genuine enlightenment of the five Buddhas is attained in a single sitting, without going through many kalpas of practice. It could perhaps be termed the Buddha Dharma's utmost sublimity. 

In Shingon, I think your human body, human mind, simultaneously Buddha. No discrimination between. 

> In light of this, what are the advantages of the practice you now speak of, that you advance it alone, ignoring all others?

Answer 4:
 
> You should know that for a Buddhist, it is not a matter of debating the superiority or inferiority of one teaching or another, or of choosing the depth or superficiality of the teaching that matters. All we have to know is whether the practice is authentic or not. 

Whether the practice is real, sincere, or true or not. [Whether] your practice is really devoted, really manifested fully, or not. That is the most important. 

So if you see human world, to say instead of sitting on, if you sit in Zazen in this world, I think most people think it is wasting time. So we should go to somewhere to save the people who are about to be disturbed to death. That is already, we are comparing two things, which is worse, which is important. That is really *debating* superiority or inferiority: which is good, which is bad. But if you think [of the] human world like this, endlessly you have debating, and no answer. 

So what you have to do is, [...] to know who you are, what your position is, what you can do, what you cannot do. And then, if you see something even slightly, then just a small deal, I think important point is, you should do it, while reflecting upon yourself, whether your practice is really sincere or devoted fully. That is [what] Dogen Zenji [says] here. 

This is really compassion. It’s really compassionate. But usually, different denominations always discussing about Christianity is pretty deep [or] Christianity is not deep. Always discussing about teaching. But if you compare, if you have, well, what would you say, a conference to debate which schools are the best teaching in this world. [Then] endlessly, you have to do, and also you will see no conclusion. 

So that’s why I mentioned, I think finally what we have to do is to practice sincerely with true heart, whoever you are, whatever denomination you belong to. 

Well, even though you don't believe any religion, or you don't belong to any religion, anyway what you have to do is to take best care of your life with a sincere heart. And then, you will really understand. And then you will understand the religion or spiritual life, even though you don't belong to. 

So Dogen Zenji’s talking is exactly universal to [...] the people who seek for the spiritual life or not. 

> Men have flowed into the Buddha way, drawn by grasses and flowers, mountains and running water. Holding earth, rocks, sand, pebbles, they have grasped completely the Buddha seal. Need it be said, vast great worlds are imprinted on all things in nature and are still abundant. 

I think the, we can attain enlightenment through pebbles, grasses, flowers, mountains, running waters, even the words. So vast and great words are imprinted on all things in nature and are still abundant. But if you understand, if you deal with the words which is insuperior, well, I think you never know how important worlds are. So the great opportunity to realize what the truth is, great opportunity to live up to a state of true existence. There are many opportunities, many opportunities in grasses, in flowers, mountains, running waters, everywhere. So that's why Dogen Zenji mentioned here. 

> A single mote of dust also is enough to turn the great Dharma Wheel. 

I think in the Tendai or Tientai teachings, I think they emphasize the three thousand worlds in a single thought, in a single thought at the moment. So as in that Dogen Zenji mentions here, a single mote of dust also is enough to turn the great Dharma Wheel. So,

> Because of this, the words “the mind in itself is Buddha” are but the moon in the water. “The heart of sitting itself is attaining Buddha” is like words, reflection in a mirror. Do not get caught up in skillful words. 

So the word is very skillful. If you don't pay attention to them carefully, you are completely carried away. But if you pay attention to it, words give you great opportunity to realize the true state of existence. 

So that's why Dogen Zenji mentions the words “the mind in itself is Buddha,” it is still shadow, it is still the moon in the water. It is nothing, it's not *real* moon, it is still shadow of the moon. “The heart of the sitting itself is attaining Buddha” is likewise a reflection in a mirror. 

So still whatever you say, we are Buddha. We say so, in words. But it is still shadow of the existence. So that's why, “Do not get caught up in skillful words.” 

Not only the words, through the practice of zazen, through studying Buddhism, then you experience the truth which we are Buddha. And then immediately we believe this is, “I realize the truth, we are Buddha.” But it is nothing but a shadow of experience. But you have to really penetrate the true state of experience you have had, through and through. In order to do this, I think we have to go beyond the trace of experience we have had. 

But usually we are bogged down with experience, feelings. Feelings and experience is important for us, but real things is going beyond them. Otherwise you are really tricked by words, experience, feelings, etc. Finally, you are confused...

*[Tape change.]* 

> Now to advance the practice of direct realization of enlightenment, I indicate to men the wondrous Way Buddhas and patriarchs have all transmitted the Dharma from one to another, with the intention that they should become real men of the Way.

This is Buddha's compassion. Buddha always mentions how to get to the other shore directly and straightly, as best as you can. This is a teaching, anyway, in words. 

And then we try to understand his teaching, and then if you understand the point of his teaching, then you say, "I attain enlightenment. I am Buddha. I am enlightened." But this is nothing but a shadow of a teaching. 

Real point, real spirit of the teaching is to let you be true men of the way, universe. Way means the universe or the truth. Freedom. Based on freedom, the spirit of freedom. 

So that is Buddha's compassion. Buddha's compassion is nothing but the intention that they try to let the human being to be true human body and mind. That is Buddha's teaching. 

> Moreover, in the receiving and transmitting of the Buddha Dharma, it is absolutely necessary to take as teacher one who is stamped with realization. A word counting scholar will not do, for that would be like one blind man leading a troop of blind men. 

Well, this is always we do. It is the usual case. Even though we practice. Actually, we are always leading the people like this. 

Individually we believe, “I teach,” we teach Buddha's teaching. But I don't know, if it is true or not. 

So, not only the scholar, but also the [practitioner] too. There are many practitioners, Buddhists, not only in the United States, but also in Japan, wherever you may go. 

> Now all students who follow the right transmission of Buddhas and Tathagatas are directed to revere the clear-sighted master who has attained the Way and is in accord with realization, and to maintain the Buddha Dharma.

Point is, to make every possible effort to maintain buddha-dharma, truth. In other words, profound sublimity. How sublime human life is. Under all circumstances, not particular circumstances. 

That is called compassion. We have to receive it, and transmit it. That is called buddha-mind, or buddha- dharma, we say. Or generally speaking, we say truth. 

> Since this is so, the spirits of the realms of light and darkness also come to him and take refuge; enlightened arhats as well come to seek the Dharma. 

Means all sentient beings come to practice, if you do it. Beyond sectarianism, beyond races. 

> None are excluded from being taught the means for illuminating the mind. This is something unheard of in other teachings. Followers of Buddha should simply learn the buddha-dharma.

So, the point is, Dogen Zenji mentions again here how important you have to see the true teacher. And under here, under full, you have to practice. Because this is an important point Dogen Zenji really experienced truly, when he went to China. That's why in his works, always he mentions [this] here and there in his works. 

> You should also know that basically we lack nothing of highest enlightenment. Though we are forever endowed with it, since we are unable to be in complete accord with it, we have a way of giving rise to random intellections, and by chasing them as if they were real, we stumble vainly on the great Way. Because of these intellections, flowers in the air of various kinds appear: thoughts of a twelve linked chain of transmigration, or of realms of twenty-five forms of existence, views of three vehicles, five vehicles, Buddha, no-buddha – they are endless. You shouldn't think that learning such intellectualizations is the right path of practice in the Buddha Dharma. 
> 
> But when you now totally cast aside all things and single-mindedly do zazen in accordance with the Buddha-seal, then, beyond the realms of illusion and enlightenment, sentiments and calculations, untouched by the difference of unenlightened and enlightened, you immediately walk at ease beyond established forms and regulations and employ great enlightenment. What have those enmeshed in the traps and snares of words and letters to compare to this? 

So, Dogen Zenji says, behind the words, what does the Buddha or ancestors try to tell us? Not words. Words are very skillful, very tricky. So if you don't deal with them properly, you are caught by them. But if you really use words deeply, it really helps you so much. 

So the point behind the words, or within the words, I think what we have to do is how to maintain buddha-seal. Buddha-seal means we are already Buddha. There is lack of nothing. Dogen Zenji says, “lack nothing of highest enlightenment.” We are Buddha is complete beyond we are perfect or not perfect. This is called Buddha. 

So, I think we don't understand who we are totally, by our self-consciousness. We don't understand it. Self-consciousness always evaluates whether we are complete or we are incomplete, or good or bad. But [the point that] we are Buddha means that we are complete beyond this completion or incompletion. Self-consciousness, or time, beyond time. 

But this is, I think, not only... this is Dogen's teaching, but I think this teaching is open to anyone. Sportsmen, artists, whoever they are. Actually, they experience this, exactly. But it seems to be a little easier to experience this, because their territory is a little bit limited. So-called mountains: object is mountains, object is rock mountains. So all they have to do is to face the mountains and climb. So very naturally, we can easily devote ourselves totally to the mountains. Then, they finally become adept through experience of going beyond self, time, and experiencing the fascinating energies back and forth between the mountains and climbers, which no one stops. Naturally, they can become adept of the mountaineer. But spiritual life doesn't have any particular objects, so-called mountains, or art, et cetera. That's why you have to have the object the universe. You have to have universe, all sentient beings as objects. That's really vast and big object. You don't know how to deal [with it].

That's why we don't know how to devote ourselves totally. How to devote ourselves to deal with all sentient beings, and life and death, and experiencing that great energies back and forth between you and universe. We don't know. It's pretty hard. That's why most people say, it is wasting time. 

But you, can do it. How? When? Where? This is zazen. Exactly. 

Okay. 

#### 55:32

During sesshin, I think you should be more careful to deal with your behavior. When the zazen is over, I think your action is very rough. Moving to the right, to the left, very quick and rough. I think Fukanzazengi mentions that you cannot do it, because you have been calm during the sitting, so you cannot move quickly. So slowly you should move. Also, you shouldn't loudly sigh, or cough, and blowing nose and etc. As best as you can, you should make the sound small. 

If you sigh always, I think you lose the energy. Because zazen is not the cause of losing your energy; the sighing you have made is the cause of losing energy. And also, interrupting others. So, even though you think it is hard, I think you shouldn't sigh loudly. It's really interrupting. 

And also, I think you should forget. Forget means you should throw away all things. “I am qualified to become Buddhist” or “I am qualified to attain enlightenment” – it's completely something else, secondary. You should throw away anything. And then, all you can do is just sit down, totally. That's what Buddha [says]. [What] ancestors [say] constantly. That is simultaneously trusting *you*, accepting you as a Buddha. 

If I explain philosophically, it is explainable. According to Buddha's teaching. Particularly according to the theory of cause and effect, it is exactly. If you do, if in a moment you become Buddha, it is exactly theoretical, very theoretical. But if I explain theoretically, you are just cheated by the understanding of intellectual Buddha's teaching. That's why without explanation, you should taste it. Practically. Do something with wholeheartedness. This is nothing but progress, great progress. How much progress? You cannot know. Because it is Buddha's progress. The progress which you can see is not Buddha's progress. It is not to receive the truth you are Buddha. To receive you are Buddha *is* great progress. 

So, no *kyosaku*. Actually, no teaching. All you have to do is just sitting all day. But it’s pretty hard for us. That's why we have a meal, and you can have an opportunity to go to the bathroom, and to sleep, and also to have lectures. But in Rinzai, if you go to Rinzai, there is no sleep. You have to sit *all night*, for seven days, anyway. Of course, they feed you. But no sleep. No lecture. 

But this is a little easier practice. *[Someone laughs.]* But just sitting is comfortable, nothing to do. But it's pretty hard. It's really hard. But this is great medicine for us. Okay?
