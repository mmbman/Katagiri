### "The Blue Cliff Record" translated by Thomas Cleary

Quotes from the Blue Cliff Record in the talks usually refer to Cleary's translation. ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/159030232X/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_aLlMFb72FPDHC)).

This translation did not exist when Katagiri gave his talks, but now it is an essential reference.
