#### 0:00 start of recording

During this seminar I would like to study and learn about karma with you. I’m very happy to do that.

Not only human beings, but also trees and birds, animals, are born in this world, and continually move, act, and die. All sentient beings always move, act, and finally we die. Why should it be that only human beings have to think about karma?

If all sentient beings are born in this world, continue to move, continue to act, and then finally die, [then] that is our business. It is all we have to do in this whole world, in this whole life. If it is true, then why don’t you [just] be born in this world, act, move, and die? That’s enough. Why is it that human beings have to think [about] karma? Karma is a huge topic. It’s very difficult to understand. 

Why is it that Buddhism has to think about karma? Do we have to think about karma because it’s characteristic of being human? But some people don’t think about karma. Does only Buddhism have to think about karma? Is karma a characteristic of Buddhism, or a characteristic of Eastern people? Maybe so. But I don’t think so. 

It might seem that American people or Western people don’t think about karma, because karma is already a Buddhist term. But from a different angle, American people and Western people [also] look at the human world, human life, human death. If you don’t believe this, please study the funeral services in Greece, Egypt, Europe, wherever it is. Each country has a traditional ceremony [for] funeral service, and [they have animals drawn in characters] in order to send the person to the other world in peace and harmony. This is exactly the same sense as that of karma. In a different way, human beings try to understand human life, human death, even though they don’t use [the word] karma. So broadly speaking, this problem of karma is not only a characteristic of Buddhist people. This is not only the Asian peoples’ business; this is completely a human problem. Sooner or later, we have to think [about it]. 

Buddhism [in general], not just karma, is pretty similar: Buddhist teaching is not only Eastern culture. Of course, as long as Buddhism is developing in a certain society, Buddhism is part of the culture. So we can say Buddhism is Eastern culture; yes it is. And then if American people try to understand Buddhism, try to study Buddhism, and try to develop Buddhism in the United States, you believe it’s impossible, because Buddhism is Eastern culture. [If] you try to plant Eastern culture into American culture, immediately you are against it, because they are completely different, don’t you think so? I always go to Milwaukee and Omaha and several places and talk about Buddhism. Very often, people are consciously or unconsciously against it, because they believe Buddhism is Eastern culture, that it is characteristic of Eastern people’s way of thinking. But I don’t think so, I don’t think so. Buddhism always focuses on *humanity*. Please remember this. Buddhism as an Eastern culture: don’t worry, forget it. *[He laughs.]* It’s okay. 

So if you want to study Buddhism, please study Buddhism until it penetrates your life. Sooner or later, you’ll understand. Buddhism is always focused on humanity, taking away all [...] human cultural background, whatever it is. Whatever aspect of Buddhist teaching you pick up – impermanence, suffering, karma, or time and space, whatever it is – it’s really universal. 

So from this point, I don’t think the subject of karma is open only to Eastern people or particular peoples, but this is [for] all beings. 

#### 8:40

Traditionally, there are three meanings of karma. 

One meaning is just *action*, human action, with no sense of morality. *Just action* means, for instance, stretching your arms, lifting your hands, lying down, jumping, sitting, walking, sleeping, et cetera. This is just action, with no sense of morality. That is called karma, particularly in *Abhidharmakosha* – that is the oldest Buddhist Psychology. 

The second meaning is *religious ritual*. That is also called karma. This is maybe influenced by Brahmanism, because Brahmanism believes that people can go to heaven by handling religious ritual in the proper way. If you don’t handle religious ritual in the proper way, you cannot go to heaven. Brahmanism particularly emphasizes this religious ritual. So broadly speaking, religious ritual is called karma. 

The third meaning is *karmic retribution of causation*, cause and effect. This is the subject I want to study with you at this time: karmic retribution. Karmic retribution is the continuation of the process of karma, and its result. *Result* means this human body and mind – what I am here, named Katagiri. This is retribution of causation. Where does this body and mind come from? It comes from karma, which we have accumulated from the beginningless past. Simply speaking, what is this body and mind? Simply speaking, we say this is karmic result. In Sanskrit, we say *karma-vipāka*; vipāka means result. 

Anyway, in order have this body and mind, behind this body and mind there is something which makes it possible for human body and mind to exist, right now, right here. This is what is called karma. That karma has lasted through century after century, from the beginningless past. This is the karma we want to learn about at this time. 

But it’s really mysterious stuff. *[He chuckles.]*

#### 13:55

A certain Buddhist scripture describes four things that are mysteries:

One is *the state of Buddha Mind*. We don’t know what Buddha is. *[He chuckles.]* But it’s huge. And the concept of Buddha is not exactly the same as the concept of God, et cetera. It’s very difficult to understand.

The second is *the state of samadhi*. Are you familiar with the term *samadhi*? In English we say *concentration*, but samadhi is not concentration exactly. The real meaning of samadhi is a state of *traceless* concentration. Traceless concentration: no trace of concentration. That is samadhi.

For instance, if you play piano, or if you play football, and exactly you can be one with them. You can concentrate on the football; wherever the ball goes, you can really move toward the ball. But at that time we don’t use consciousness; immediately you *tune in* to the ball. That is really concentration: becoming one. At that time you don’t use consciousness; consciousness is going constantly, but consciousness doesn’t bother your actions. So [your] actions are exactly one with the ball, and exactly one with the ball’s actions, and people’s actions. At that time, can you say “I am concentrating?” I don’t think so. There is no trace of concentration. Do you understand? That is called samadhi. So [it is] *full* concentration; full devotion. 

When you do something you are interested in, at that time you can really devote yourself, to dive into it. But if you don’t like it, if you are not interested in it – just like zazen – you really hate it. *[He chuckles.]* Don’t you think so? *[Laughter.]* 

And also the problem is, [with sports,] or if you become an artist, or whatever you do, always there is an object you can concentrate on. If you play piano, always there is the piano, and composers, and notes, and the audience. And after the complete experience of samadhi, you can get applause from people. Often there is some object before and after, and even in the middle. Always you have this. But in zazen, there is no object – just using your body and mind, and just your body and mind become one. Become one with what? Body and mind. So there is no object. And even though you do zazen perfectly, there is no applause. No one gives you applause after zazen or before zazen. And even though you criticize your zazen by yourself, good or bad, right or wrong – no one criticizes you, just you continue to criticize. Finally, you exhaust [yourself]. Finally you think, “This is stupid.” And if you tell the teacher that, he just says, “Fine, good. Why don’t you sit down?” Even though you have a good experience: “Fine, good. Why don’t you sit down?” And if you experience something bad from zazen: “Fine, good. This is also part of your body, so please continue, sit down.” So always there is no applause, before or after. You don’t understand this, because it’s pretty difficult to become one, which is called samadhi. Samadhi is completely beyond your speculation. You cannot poke your head into it. This is *[unintelligible]*. Your whole body and mind can *be* there, just like a football player; you can be just there. But [there is] nothing to touch. 

So this is the state of samadhi. It’s very difficult: if you touch it, the moment when you touch it, it’s already not real samadhi. That’s why state of samadhi is one of the mysteries, the mysterious things. 

The third one is *the will of the world*. The will of the world means maybe the will of existence; maybe so, according to my understanding. The world has a certain will. This a really strong will – which is called *impermanence*, which is called *change*, which is called *suffering*. That is the will of the world, or existence. Whatever you think, everything is changing, impermanent. That is really one of the mysterious things. It’s very difficult to understand. 

And the last one is *the state of karma-vipāka*, karma result. That is the human body and mind. Each of us. 

So both karma and also the continuation of the process of karma and its result is one of the four mysterious things. And also the scripture says that if you try to think about them, you can become crazy and confused. Karma, and also the human body and mind as karmic result, is not something you try to think, but in the realm of samadhi you have to get a taste of it. This is karma. 

#### 22:44

The Indian people were very afraid of karma, because karma was exactly the idea that if you do something good you will get something good, but if you do something wrong, you will have something wrong as a result. So always there was a strong power behind the Indian people’s lives, just like a shadow, which controlled their lives. The Indian people were very afraid of this idea of karma, because [that] karma was always behind them and in control. 

Generally speaking, they believed karma according to [one of] three points:

One is that karma, or our human body, karmic result, is [something that] is already created in the past. That is one point: you, and everybody, already created your body and mind in the past.

The second point is that karma, the human body, is that which certain gods made. 

The third is that there is no cause: no one made the karma in the past. So human body and mind, or human action, whatever it is, just happened by chance.

The first two are sort of fatalism, because you made already made [your karma] in the past. So that karma is already a certain frame of categories, which is called Katagiri. If I say Katagiri, Katagiri already has a certain *[unintelligible]*, which no one controls, which even I cannot control. *In the past* means [...] including the past before my birth. [So] this is caste. My karma is that which is already made in the past – so, I cannot do anything.

Or [also], if you say karma is that which god made, at that time there is nothing to do. That is really fatalism.

Finally, the other excessive idea is: “Don’t worry; forget it. We were born in this world by chance, no cause. So don’t worry.” This is another excessive idea, because always karma is sort of a demon, haunting the Indian people. So that’s why they tried to escape from karma, tried to be free from that karma. 

#### 27:44

Well, not only the Indian people. If you start to study Buddhism, commonly you [may] feel something [about] karma. Probably most of you feel a little bit scared. 

For instance in [the book] *Shogun* – did you read *Shogun*? I didn’t read it yet, but according to people and reviews, et cetera, people in the book *Shogun* sort of [had no] control, because all the people, particularly Japanese women, were completely molded in a certain frame. It’s very sad. In such a situation, those people accept the situation of human life, which is called karma. So in this case karma [does not have] a good sense. Karma has an unwholesome sense; it makes your situation in human life get worse and worse. That is sort of demons. Finally in such a situation, people give up in their lives. They just blindly accept such a situation. 

That is how people usually understand karma. 

If you read classic Japanese literature, you can feel a sense of pensiveness. The term karma is very common, very popular in Japan. It penetrates their lives. They use the term karma very often; even though they don’t understand what it is. But that term karma is not the good sense; it’s always a little bit pensive feeling there. For instance, if the more you try to develop your life, the more you realize that your situation is getting worse, going downhill – at that time people say, “That is your karma.” But it is not really karma. 

#### 31:32

Probably I told you, my mother always told me that I was reborn from my sister. Constantly she told me this. And also, I was born in this world when my mother saw the morning sunrise, so she told me, “You are the reincarnation of the sun.” *[Unintelligible.]* *[Laughter.]* 

For my mother, the sun and the moon were not different [in content from] the Buddha. My mother and my father always expressed appreciation to the Buddha and ancestors, and the sun, the moon, all things. Every day – morning, before going to bed – they appreciated [all things]. The sun and the moon were exactly the same for them. Buddha is exactly the sun, Buddha is exactly the moon. So they really accepted the existence of the sun and the moon very smoothly, straightforwardly. That’s why she could say, “You are the incarnation of the sun.” But I didn’t understand. 

Even though I didn’t understand, if somebody is constantly carrying that way, finally you believe it, don’t you think so? *[He laughs.]* [Like if] everybody says you should believe in God constantly, finally you believe. [Like] Dogen Zenji says, the Korean people first pretend to cry when they attend funeral service. Even though you don’t feel sad, anyway pretend to cry, and finally you can cry exactly. *[He laughs.]*

So, my mother constantly told me I was the rebirth of my sister, and the incarnation of the sun. But this is a pretty good sense of what is called karma, [although] I didn’t know the term karma at that time. On the other hand, in Japanese life, generally speaking, karma was not used in a good sense, but always in a bad sense. That’s why I was pretty confused: this other karma is pretty good, but karma is not good. Do you understand? Because if I say, “that is my karma,” at that time people don’t accept karma in a good sense; it’s sort of that my life is always set up [a certain way]. I cannot change, I cannot develop, if I understand karma in that way. But I don’t think that is my karma. 

#### 35:25

And then ... Buddhist priest came to my home and performed a Buddhist service every month. Strictly speaking, I felt this priest, which is called, I don’t know, I felt he was not a human being. I felt he was a beautiful person, sort of a celestial being – beautiful. He was at that time about fifty-five. Every month he came to our house and performed a Buddhist service. I was very attracted by him. But he doesn’t imagine, and my parents didn’t say anything about him – just I felt that. So this is as a karmic result maybe maybe my body and mind, why is it that I have to be attracted by him? Attracted? No, excuse me. Why I have to attract him. Is that good? Even now, I cannot understand. But if understand my body and mind as a karmic result, maybe my life is lasting from beginningless past, that’s what makes me seeking for such a beautiful person. And also I am also think9ing, “What is karma?”

When I became a monk and went to Eiheiji monastery, one of the monks was very elegant, and very smart and sharp. And he was always sitting in his room, by himself, and sit down, straight posture, reading Shobogenzo, always. I was very surprised. Every time I passed by, he is sort of sitting at a table like this ... zazen, sitting like this, reading Shobogenzo. I was very impressed. But I just passed by always. Finally I came across him in the hallway of Eiheiji monastery, so I asked him, “What ... is karma?” Because in Shobogenzo, Dogen Zenji explains about karma in the past, present, and future. So I asked him, “What is karma?” SO he just smiled, and he said, “Karma is not something you have to think. Karma is something you have to believe in.” ... In other words, to believe, for him he used the term believe, that believe is to get a taste of. To get a taste of karma through what? Through samadhi, dhyāna. Sitting. Do you understand dhyāna? Perfect tranquility. Perfect tranquility means you and zazen are one, you and the football are one. At that time, no gap between. That is what is called tranquility. Because your life is constantly moving, ... suffering. Just move. Even though you hit or even though you cut, you don’t realize. And then after finishing the football, then maybe you can realize, “Oh, I cut my finger,” et cetera. But whatever happens, tranquility is not something still, [that] you don’t do [anything]. This is not tranquility. Tranquility is completely no gap between you and zazen. But if you create a gap between, that is sort of not tranquility, because this is already space which human consciousness can get in. That is not tranquility. Already you have stirred up the water. 

So get a taste of karma through samadhi means, you have to be intimate with your life, through not intellectual world. Anyway through the samadhi. Samadhi means, I told you always, samadhi, if you be one with, right now right here, that oneness is not connected with you, but also connected with your past, trees, birds, in the present, and also tree, birds in the past too. That is realm of samadhi. That is very peaceful and tranquil. That’s why this friend says, karma is not something you can think. 

Also Buddhist scripture talks about the four mysterious things that you cannot think about; if you think about them, you can be crazy and confused. So finally all we have to do is to get a taste of karma through samadhi. There is no other way. Only through this, we can get a taste of human karma. 

#### 43:38 

During this seminar, I will really do my best to explain karma which is continuing from the past. So that karma is completely nothing to control. Remember this point. On the other hand, karma is a great place where you can practice the Buddha Way. In other words, still karma is a place where you can be free. In other words, still karma is a place where you can develop deeply, enhance your life. This is karma. So I will do my best to explain this. It’s sort of contradictory. That’s why we have to understand to learn what karma is, one aspect of karma is completely you cannot control it. This is your karma. Your karma, individual karma, universal karma, whatever. Karma is divided into two aspects, broadly speaking, that is individual karma and universal karma. I am Japanese, you are Americans: that is individual karma. But all of you are Americans, that is universal karma. Sort of like that. Anyway, whatever it is: I am Japanese, at that time this karma is completely beyond control. So karma has two aspects, one is completely no control, on the other hand, karma is the place where you can deepen, develop, enhance your life. Be free from karma. 

That is my effort I will have to do with my best effort. Do you have some questions?

#### 46:20

**Question**: Roshi, you talked about informed ... 

*[Tape change.]*

#### 46:31

**Question**: Roshi, is it a misunderstanding that, it seems that people in popular talk use the word karma, they mean either the collection of your good and bad deeds, which will give you a higher or lower life next time. Or else they mean your past ... what happens here now.

**Katagiri**: That is one aspect of karma. That is a misunderstanding, anyway. ... So karma continues from the past, through the present, to the future. This is karma. 

**Question**: Roshi, are all things that happen ... walk outside of this building and trip and fall down. Is that karma, or are there things that happen that are simply action?

**Katagiri**: Yes, it is also called karma. In the scripture, including all the things that happen, those things are included as karma. 

**Same person**: Are they included as karma in that second sense? Remember, you mentioned first there was karma that was just action. And then the sense that we were talking about was retribution. 

**Katagiri**: Well just action, and also natural disasters, and sometimes you have to die by natural disasters, natural event. Or if you walk on the street and someone hits you ... someone stabs you ... happens. In that sense the ... the event are also ... karma. 

**Same person**: Are they connected with your past?

**Katagiri**: Yes, I think so. For instance, still ... Buddhist scriptures says karma is one of the mysterious things, okay? The other one Buddhist scripture says, karma is very powerful. No control. This always happens, don’t you think so? For instance, ..., one of the Buddha’s famous disciples, who was noted for seeing the past, the present, the future clearly. That was his wisdom. But he was killed by ... he died. But ... also even in the modern world, such things happen, don’t you think so? The other day, I forgot the name of the bridge, but a bridge all of a sudden broke, and people died. But one person survived. Her car stopped right on the edge of the bridge. ... How can I explain? No way.

I also thought when I was in college, I read the western novels and literature. The person which occurs in this novel, finally he died just like that. When she walked on the bridge and then the bridge broke and then he died. I was very surprised by that conclusion: Why? Why only this person had to die like this? He said, “Well, Katagiri, you should say something for that that.” *[He laughs.]* Always I try to think karma. Everyone stop thinking. I cannot continue to think. 

#### 51:43

**Question**: Roshi? Was the second understanding of karma, where you have a place to experience, does that give you more control over the first aspect of it? ... Does the effort and the practice have an impact on the no control, does that have the power to influence whatever the ...

**Katagiri**: Yes. Sure. Right. I will talk about that point too. 

Broadly speaking, the purpose of Buddhist practice is we should accumulate power of good habit, in order to reach the beautiful ideal image of human life. Anyway continue to accumulate power of habit. And then this is really what is called karma, and in the future it shoots. When the time is right, conditions arranged, it grows. 

So if you say karma, broadly speaking karma is understood as action. Physical and mental action, psychological action too. So if you do act, there is act which appears on the surface. In other words there is one aspect of act, which manifests itself. The other one is act which does not manifest. That is accumulate. That is if you do something, you can leave a certain impression after your doings. This is the Buddhist theory, anyway. If you do act, mentally or psychologically or physically, if you do something, always something is left as an impression in the human mind, human body. That is what is called kan-ju, that means ... And then, practicing zazen, if you accumulate the power of habit which is called concentrating on your breath – even though automatically if you can breath, this is very good habit, don’t you think so? But if your mind pokes into it, you say that is like a machine. So you hate it. But through the machine your consciousness really works pretty well. But if you contemplate it, even though just like habits, that is great power of habit. So even such a things, we try to accumulate that power of habit. And then ... stored in your mind, behind your action. And then those things will shoot up. Either while you are around here, or during your next life, or while you are in the life after next. We don’t know. But we have to see not only this life: past life, present life, and future life. Life after next. We have to think. That is the purpose of Buddhist practice. Aiming at the long range. So just accumulate that habit, and plant good roots. 

#### 56:50

**Question**: Hojo-san? How does that exist with zazen as an end and not as a means, and not having any goals in zazen?

**Katagiri**: *No goal of zazen* is not no goal of zazen, okay? *No goal* means samadhi, exactly samadhi – you have to experience samadhi itself. That is what is called *no goal*. If you say “here is a goal,” it’s already an object. But main purpose is, if you want to live in peace and harmony, or what is called freedom, or happiness, anyway we have to experience samadhi itself. In the samadhi there is no subject and object. That is ... we call *no goal* in practice. *No merit*. Whatever it is. If you do something, of course, you experience. But that experience is sort of ... ... 

So no goal doesn’t mean to ignore the purpose of human action. Human action always has a certain purpose. But it doesn’t mean that; of course, we act something like this. But that is not the main purpose. The main purpose in Buddhism is to experience samadhi itself. In the samadhi, there is no object. 

Well, if you ... I cannot talk this time on karma. According to Buddhist philosophy, because it’s a huge system. For instance you have to study karma according to primitive Buddhism; the agamas. Next, we have to study Abhidharmakosha; that is the oldest Buddhist psychology. That is complicated. But anyway, it explains what karma is... and it’s huge. It gives you a headache. *[People chuckle.]* And next, you have to study the Madhyamakas; Madhyamakas explain emptiness. So Madhyamakas explains karma. You have to study this, and also, next, Buddhist Psychology which developed after the Madhyamakas. This is also explaining karma. And also *[he laughs,]* another one is the Avatamsaka Sutra. This is a beautiful sutra explaining all sentient beings interpenetration; it explains this state of perfect dynamic working. That’s a beautiful sutra. In this sutra also explains karma, but it doesn’t have a particular section on karma, so you have to study the whole sutra and then pick up the points about karma. And also, maybe the Lotus Sutra? And also on karma according to Chinese Zen, and Japanese Zen, *[he laughs,]* and also the Pure Land school, and Tendai school... Anyway, it’s a huge Buddhist system. I should talk about all things, so as much as possible I would like to explain karma through my experience, and also I want you get a taste of what is karma, even a little bit. Okay? That’s what I want to do at this time. But my sort of seminar is just an introduction of karma, but if you are interested in karma, you have to study, one by one. 

And also, unfortunately, there are not many textbooks on karma. ... but there are lots of short essays, but it’s very difficult to find it. In India, Japan, lots of things, but they’re very difficult to find. So now we can get maybe get maybe ... explains about karma in reverse. That is a pretty good book.
