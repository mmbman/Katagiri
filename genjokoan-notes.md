#### Updated February 23, 2026

On this page I provide notes and links to where Katagiri Roshi commented on Zen Master Dōgen’s *Genjōkōan*, or where he discussed key terms used in it. This document is a work in progress. I will update it as I transcribe talks and find additional references.

[SZ] indicates text from the Sotoshu translation of *Shōbōgenzō*.  [TC] indicates Thomas Cleary’s translation from *Shōbōgenzō: Zen Essays by Dōgen* (or perhaps an earlier version of it), which Katagiri Roshi used in some talks.

> 
> [SZ] At times when the dharmas are the buddha dharma, just then there are delusion and awakening; there is practice; there is birth; there is death; there are buddhas; there are living beings.
> 
> [TC] When all things are Buddha-teachings, then there is delusion and enlightenment, there is cultivation of practice, there is birth, there is death, there are Buddhas, there are sentient beings.

##### 1.2

> 萬法ともにわれにあらざる時節、まどひなく、さとりなく、諸佛なく、衆生なく、生なく、滅なし。
>
> [SZ] At times when all the myriad dharmas are not self, there is no delusion; there is no awakening; there are no buddhas; there are no living beings; there is no arising; there is no cessation.
>
> [TC] When myriad things are all not self, there is no delusion, no enlightenment, no Buddhas, no sentient beings,  no birth, no death.

##### 1.3

> 佛道もとより豊倹より跳出せるゆえに、生滅あり、迷悟あり、生佛あり。  
> 
> [SZ] Because, from the start, the way of the buddhas has jumped out from abundance and scarcity, there are arising and ceasing, there are delusion and awakening, there are living beings and buddhas.
>
> [TC] Because the Buddha Way originally sprang forth from abundance and paucity, there is birth and death, delusion and enlightenment, sentient beings and Buddhas.

- [“Taking Care of Karma” at 1:00:05](1980-07-04-Karma-Taking-Care-of-Karma#10005): “The Buddha Way is completely beyond the concept of being or not-being, that’s why there are human beings and buddhas, life and death, delusion and enlightenment.” [KR]

##### 1.4

> しかもかくのごとくなりといへども、花は愛惜にちり、草は棄嫌におふるのみなり。
>
> [SZ] And yet, while this may be so, it is simply “flowers falling when we cherish them, weeds
growing when we despise them.”
>
> [TC] Moreover, though this is so, flowers fall when we cling to them, and weeds only grow when we dislike them.

##### 2.1

> [TC] Acting on and witnessing myriad things with the burden of oneself is "delusion." 

- [“*Genjōkōan*: Talk 3” at 42:42](1987-06-07-Genjokoan-Talk-3#4242)

##### 2.2

> Acting on and witnessing oneself in the advent of myriad things is enlightenment. 

- [“*Genjōkōan*: Talk 3” at 48:01](1987-06-07-Genjokoan-Talk-3#4801)

##### 2.3

> Great enlightenment about delusion is Buddhas; great delusion about enlightenment is sentient beings. 

- [“*Genjōkōan*: Talk 3” at 50:17](1987-06-07-Genjokoan-Talk-3#5017)

##### 2.4

There are also those who attain enlightenment on top of enlightenment, and there are those who are further deluded in the midst of delusion. 

- [“*Genjōkōan*: Talk 3” at 52:17](1987-06-07-Genjokoan-Talk-3#5217)

##### 2.5

> When the Buddhas are indeed the Buddhas, there is no need to be self-conscious of being Buddhas; nevertheless it is realizing buddhahood — Buddhas go on realizing.

- [“*Genjōkōan*: Talk 3” at 53:10](1987-06-07-Genjokoan-Talk-3#5310)
- [“*Blue Cliff Record* Case 40: Nan Ch’uan’s It’s Like a Dream, Talk 2” at 36:34](1983-02-02-Blue-Cliff-Record-Case-40-Talk-2#3634) “When Buddhas are genuinely Buddhas, there is no need for them to be conscious that they are Buddhas; yet they are realized Buddhas, and they continue to realize Buddhas.”

> [TC] In seeing forms with the whole body-mind, hearing sound with the whole body-mind, though one intimately understands, it isn’t like reflecting images in a mirror, it’s not like water and the moon – when you witness one side, one side is obscure.

- [“*Genjōkōan*: Talk 3” at 57:50](1987-06-07-Genjokoan-Talk-3#5750)
- [“*Fukanzazengi*: Dōgen's Universal Recommendation for Zazen – Talk 6” at 28:46](1979-06-14-Fukanzazengi-Talk-6#2846): on “Oneness is not like moon reflected in the water, water in which moon is reflected – when one is bright, the other one is dark.”

##### 4

> [TC] Studying the Buddha Way is studying oneself. Studying oneself is forgetting oneself. Forgetting oneself is being enlightened by all things. Being enlightened by all things is causing the body-mind of oneself and the body-mind of others to be shed. There is ceasing the traces of enlightenment, which causes 

##### 5

> [TC] When people first seek the Teaching, they are far from the bounds of the Teaching. Once the Teaching is properly conveyed in oneself, already one is the original human being.

> [TC] When someone rides in a boat, as he looks at the shore he has the illusion that the shore is moving. When he looks at the boat under him, he realizes the boat is moving. In the same way, when one takes things for granted with confused ideas of body-mind, one has the illusion that one’s own mind and own nature are permanent; but if one pays close attention to one’s own actions, the truth that things are not self will be clear.

> [TC] Kindling becomes ash, and cannot become kindling again. However, we should not see the ash as after and the kindling as before. Know that kindling abides in the normative state of kindling, and though it has a before and after, the realms of before and after are disconnected. Ash, in the normative state of ash, has before and after. Just as that kindling, after having become ash, does not again become kindling, so after dying a person does not become alive again. This being the case, not saying that life becomes death is an established custom in Buddhism—therefore it is called unborn. That death does not become life is an established teaching of the Buddha; therefore we say imperishable. Life is an individual temporal state, death is an individual temporal state. It is like winter and spring—we don’t think winter becomes spring, we don’t say spring becomes summer.

- [“*Blue Cliff Record* Case 40: Nan Ch’uan’s It’s Like a Dream, Talk 2” at 36:34](1983-02-02-Blue-Cliff-Record-Case-40-Talk-2#3634): “We must realize that firewood is at the dharma stage of firewood, and although being possessed of before and after, the firewood is cut off from before and after.” Explanation of “normative state” or “dharma stage”.

> [TC] People’s attaining enlightenment is like the moon reflected in water. The moon does not get wet, the water isn’t broken. Though it is a vast expansive light, it rests in a little bit of water—even the whole moon, the whole sky, rests in a dewdrop on the grass, rests in even a single droplet of water. That enlightenment does not shatter people is like the moon not piercing the water. People’s not obstructing enlightenment is like the drop of dew not obstructing the moon in the sky. The depth is proportionate to the height. As for the length and brevity of time, examining the great and small bodies of water, you should discern the breadth and narrowness of the moon in the sky.

##### 8

> [TC] Before one has studied the Teaching fully in body and mind, one feels one is already sufficient in the Teaching. If the body and mind are replete with the Teaching, in one respect one senses insufficiency. For example, when one rides a boat out onto the ocean where there are no mountains and looks around, it only appears round, and one can see no other, different characteristics. However, this ocean is not round, nor is it square — the remaining qualities of the ocean are inexhaustible. It is like a palace, it is like ornaments, yet as far as our eyes can see, it only seems round. It is the same with all things — in the realms of matter, beyond conceptualization, they include many aspects, but we see and comprehend only what the power of our eye of contemplative study reaches. If we inquire into the "family ways" of myriad things, the qualities of seas and mountains, beyond seeming square or round, are endlessly numerous. We should realize there exist worlds everywhere. It’s not only thus in out of the way places—know that even a single drop right before us is also thus.

> [TC] As a fish travels through water, there is no bound to the water no matter how far it goes; as a bird flies through the sky，there’s no bound to the sky no matter how far it flies. While this is so, the fish and birds have never been apart from the water and the sky—it’s just that when the need is large the use is large，and when the requirement is small the use is small. In this way, though the bounds are unfailingly reached everywhere and tread upon in every single place, the bird would instantly die if it left the sky and the fish would instantly die if it left the water. Obviously, water is life; obviously the sky is life. There is bird being life. There is fish being life. There is life being bird, there is life being fish. There must be progress beyond this—there is cultivation and realization, the existence of the living one being like this.

##### 10

> [TC] Under these circumstances, if there were birds or fish who attempted to traverse the waters or the sky after having found the limits of the water or sky, they wouldn’t find a path in the water or the sky — they won’t find any place. When one finds this place, this action accordingly manifests as the issue at hand; when one finds this path, this action accordingly manifests as the issue at hand. This path, this place, is not big or small, not self or other, not preexistent, not now appearing — therefore it exists in this way. In this way, if someone cultivates and realizes the Buddha Way, it is *attaining a principle, mastering the principle*; it is *encountering a practice, cultivating the practice*. In this there is a place where the path has been accomplished, hence the unknowability of the known boundary is born together and studies along with the thorough investigation of the Buddha Teaching of this knowing—therefore it is thus. Don’t get the idea that the attainment necessarily becomes one’s own knowledge and view, that it would be known by discursive knowledge. Though realizational comprehension already takes place, implicit being is not necessarily obvious — why necessarily is there obvious becoming?

> [TC] Zen Master Hotetsu of Mt. Mayoku was using a fan. A monk asked him about this: ‘‘The nature of wind is eternal and all-pervasive —why then do you use a fan? The master said, "You only know the nature of wind is eternal, but do not yet know the principle of its omnipresence.” The monk asked, "What is the principle of its omnipresence?” The master just fanned. The monk bowed.

> The experience of the Buddha Teaching, the living road of right transmission, is like this. To say that since (the nature of wind) is permanent one should not use a fan, and that one should feel the breeze even when not using a fan, is not knowing permanence and not knowing the nature of the wind either. Because the nature of wind is eternal, the wind of Buddhism causes the manifestation of the earth’s being gold and by participation develops the long river into butter.
