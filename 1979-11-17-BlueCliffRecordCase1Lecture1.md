I have never studied [The] Blue Cliff Record (Japanese: Hekiganroku) with you, since I moved to Minneapolis. We studied Shōyōroku (“Book of Equanimity”) which is pretty similar [to] Blue Cliff Record. But this Blue Cliff Record is a little different, and pretty unique, from Shōyōroku we studied. Particularly Rinzai Zen uses this Blue Cliff Record so much. 

Blue Cliff Record consists of five parts. The main subjects are [a collection of 100 very] short stories, in question and answer style, or in conversation style, or sometimes, pretty usually, in short story style. And [also], each story has a verse of its own, by Setchō Zen Master (Chinese: Hsueh Tou Ch’ung Hsien or Xuedou Chongxian, 雪竇重顯), who lived 980-1052 (AD). Also, later, Engo Zen Master (Chinese: Yuan Wu K’e Ch’in or Yuanwu Keqin, 圓悟克勤), who lived from 1063-1135, added the introduction to the main subject, and also the notes; D.T. Suzuki used the term “pithy remarks”. Engo Zen Master added the notes to each phrase, and also commentary to the main subject and [to the] verses by Setchō Zen Master. So Blue Cliff Record consists of five parts. In this book, [the] introduction [to each case] is represented as "Pointer". So Pointer, and Case, and Notes, Commentary, and Verse, and Commentary. The verses' commentary, and also the main subjects' commentary. 

This translation of Blue Cliff Record is [the] best; a very nice translation by Dr. Thomas Cleary. 

##### 5:25

The first case: “The Highest Meaning of the Holy Truths.”

The pointer:

> When you see smoke on the other side of a mountain, you already know there’s a fire; when you see horns on the other side of a fence, right away you know there is an ox there. To understand three when one is raised, to judge precisely at a glance — this is the everyday food and drink of a patchrobed monk. Getting to where he cuts off the myriad streams, he is free to arise in the east and sink in the west, to go against or to go with, in any and all directions, free to give or to take away. But say, at just such a time, whose actions are these? Look into Hsueh Tou’s trailing vines.

[That is the] introduction, which is called pointer, to the main subject. 

##### 7:25

Let me read the main subject:

> Emperor Wu of Liang asked the great master Bodhidharma, “What is the highest meaning of the holy truths?” Bodhidharma said, “Empty, without holiness.” The Emperor said, “Who is facing me?” Bodhidharma replied, “I don’t know.” The Emperor did not understand. After this Bodhidharma crossed the Yangtse River and came to the kingdom of Wei.
> 
> Later the Emperor brought this up to Master Chih and asked him about it. Master Chih asked, “Does your majesty know who this man is?” The Emperor said, “I don’t know.” Master Chih said, “He is the Mahasattva Avalokitesvara, transmitting the Buddha Mind Seal.” The Emperor felt regretful, so he wanted to send an emissary to go invite (Bodhidharma to return). Master Chih told him, “Your majesty, don’t say that you will send someone to fetch him back. Even if everyone in the whole country were to go after him, he still wouldn’t return.”

That is [the] main subject. And the introduction is – I’ll read it [again]. *[he reads it again]*

##### 10:36

In a Zen monastery, [a] very important position is sort of the attendant to the old monk, old priest, or your teacher. Attendant, or we call it "anja" – the other attendant position is ... presented as "jisha" in Japanese. [The] anja is kind of an attendant, but this attendant is a person who takes care of many things. So, [they may be a] house maid, or food maid, or kitchen maid, or sometimes many things that you have to do. Washing the clothes, cleaning the house, the rooms, and the temples: that is anja for a particular old monk, an old priest.

When I was [at] Eiheiji monastery, I was anja or jisha for almost a year for [the] famous Zen Master Hashimoto Roshi. I learned a lot from this position, because from this position – well, I was very surprised, because I learned a lot which was completely different from usual life. Well, when you live in the usual life, the usual house, and in the relationship with your parents and brothers and sisters, friends; at that time, always we emphasize ourself first. But in the monastery, when you become attendant or anja, or jisha, all you have to do is to devote yourself to take care of him, first. So, when a guest comes, when a guest visited him, well, *next*: the anja and jisha has to know what to do next, what will happen next. When the visitor gets to his room, next, what should we do. Should we wait for [the] teacher, the old priest to call you: “Dainin. Come here, Dainin. Serve tea, and give a hot towel, and a cold towel in summer.” Should I wait; or before he calls me, should I go. Or, before, even though he doesn’t say anything, should I do something, should I start to do something initiatively. This is very important.

So, in Eiheiji Monastery, I learned a lot from this position, because there is no excuse. I have to always pay attention to [him first]; [I am] secondary to him. So what happens around him, I have to always pay attention to it. When the visitor gets to his room, immediately I have go to his room, open the door, and serve the tea. Before serving the tea, in summer, I gave [a] cold towel, [for] cleaning the hands and face, and then after that, served the tea.

##### 16:00

I always took care of him and guests in that way. 

One day, a guest came to his room, and immediately I went to his room, and gave the cold towel in summer, and started to serve. But at that time, I [had] got used to serving tea – very naturally, because I had had this position for six months at that time, so I’d got used to taking care of everything. So I served tea, and that is green tea, tea ceremony. At that time, the cleaning cloth should be always on the tray; but that time I didn’t pay careful attention to the cleaning cloth. I was interested in talking with the guest, and [the talk] between the guest and the Roshi. That was very interesting, because even in the chatting you can find very interesting, very wonderful conversation there. Even the chat is wonderful; you become peaceful and joyful. Very nice. There is no fighting and such a thing; it’s really paradise. All movements [in] the room [are] completely peaceful. So in this room I was completely caught by their conversation. But my hand was moving like this. *[laughter]* And then I put the cloth on the floor. [The roshi] immediately said: “Mmmph.” *[laughter]* [The] cleaning cloth shouldn’t be on [the] floor. It should be on the tray.

[At the monastery], even though you get [used to] doing something, always there is careful attention, compassionate attention penetrates everything. But if you are completely caught by something, well, your body is moving but your mind is completely taking a trip. So at that time, that is not [the] real thing you are doing. You have to do something with your body, but simultaneously you have to do something with your body and with the mind. Mind must be present there. That’s why the master immediately pointed it out. 

##### 19:20

And also, your behavior, your acts: not necessarily rapid behavior. Not slowly, not rapidly – I don’t know how to do [it]. But anyway, your mind [and] your body are going just like the [flow] of a river. But when you have to [do this], your compassionate attention penetrates every inch of your behavior, and also others: teachers, and guests, and the whole room. So when something happens, you have to do [something] immediately. 

One day I served [the tea], and then I tipped over the teacup, and the tea spilled on the floor. At that time, I tried to find some rag, sort of a mop. But the one monk [who] sat next to me, immediately he took the towel for cleaning your face and immediately cleaned [the spill]. But I didn’t do this. I noticed the cleaning towel there, but I didn’t take it. I tried to find [the] right thing, which is called rag, [for] cleaning the floor, not cleaning of face, cleaning of table. And then the Zen Master scolded me: “What are you doing?” *[he chuckles]* Well, of course its very clear what I am doing, because I want to clean the water spilled on the floor. But he scolds me, “What are you doing?” After the other monk had cleaned [it] already, he scolded me. I didn’t understand. 

According to the intellectual sense, towel is not something for cleaning on the floor; it’s very clear. So if you want to clean the floor, you have to get the right thing, which is called rag or mop, and clean. This is [the] intellectual understanding, but sometimes there is no chance to find the right thing, because it is [an] emergency. So ... you have to act, just like an emergency.

So according to common intellectual sense, he is wrong, he did something wrong, [and] I was doing something right. But he scolded me and he praised the other monk, because he did it already. So that is [a] pretty important thing. Do you understand this sense? 

But I don’t think you should do [things] always just like [an] emergency. For instance, the rain is leaking from the ceiling, but that rain is just like a shower in summer. The rains immediately come in leaking from the ceiling and, what should you do? Should you take the time to find the right thing? 

Or, for instance, if a fire comes up, what should you do? That is really [an] emergency. So maybe you should find some mops and the fire extinguisher, then you should put [it] out; but sometimes [there is] no time, so sometimes you have to take off your clothes and cover the fire. Maybe it is okay. 

So [in] the emergency, there is something you have to do. There is no discussion “it is right, it is wrong”; anyway we have to do. So that’s why Zen Master scolded me, “what are you doing?” But he did it immediately. That’s wonderful. But according to common sense, it’s wrong. 

##### 25:26

That’s why in the introduction, Engo Zen Master says, “When you see smoke on the other side of the mountain, you already know there is a fire.” It’s very clear. When the Zen master is leaving the temple, at that time I have to do something, even though he doesn’t ask me. Put the shoes in order at the gate. He could [arrange] his sandals [himself] very easily [in the zendo]. Do you know the sandals? When you come down from the [sitting platform to] the floor, if you put the sandals like this, the toes [are pointing] away from you. And then the teacher comes down, and then his feet immediately slip [into his] sandals, [and he] gets up. But if you put sandals like this (turned inward), he has to turn [them] first, and then put the feet [there]. I did [that] once; at that time he scolded me. “So what should I do?” He said, “You should put the sandals like this.” So I did it. This is [a] very important thing, how you should put the sandals for him. So, you have to think. You have to think how he is going down [to] the floor, and putting his feet on the sandals. As much as possible, you should take care of him, [so he] is not wasting his energy too much. So take care of it, so immediately he puts his feet on [the] sandals, pretty easily. 

Or, before he is leaving the temple to go [out] to the people to perform a Buddhist service, et cetera, I put the tabi socks [for] his feet; even though he didn’t ask me, I [did] it. Put the sandals and socks [there]; when it’s raining, get the umbrella. When it’s cold, get the coat. That is really just like a maid; the house maid, and kitchen maid, many things; that is really lots of miscellaneous jobs. So you have to open your eyes carefully to take care of everything. If you miss something, teachers scold me. So that is the duty of anja and jisha. 

So, that’s why in introduction he said, “when you see horns on the other side of a fence, right away you know there is an ox there. To understand three when one is raised, to judge precisely at a glance.” Immediately you have to know, okay? We have to know.

When you attend, when you have such positions for a certain period of time, you understand what he is feeling, what he is wanting next. My teacher, I knew pretty well what my teacher was wanting next. So always before that, I did it; give, or offer, or help.

##### 30:11

“To understand three when one is raised, to judge precisely at a glance. This is the everyday food and drink of a patch-robed monk.” This is really everyday the food and drink of a monk. That is not the particular behavior, not the particular attitude; that’s the way of life. You shouldn’t be a "snob"; you shouldn’t be “showy,” in order to get praise and reward from teachers and from your practice itself. Not showy, not snob; just do it. And this is just like everyday life, every day food and drink. It’s not particular “behavior”. 

So, when you get up in the morning, teacher gets up in the morning, immediate we have to go to his room and put his bed into the closet. Well, we used a different bed from western style, so every morning we had to put the bed [into] the closet. And next, we have to serve the tea, and ... before we serve the tea, we have to prepare for his washing the face; so hot water – not too hot, not too lukewarm, not too cold, you have to adjust. And put the paste and the cup, and many things. Just like taking care of a baby. *[he chuckles]* But he doesn’t say anything like "thank you"; just do. Always there is a string of work; next, next, next. There is no chance to think. Even though he doesn’t say “I hate [it],” why [doesn't he] say “thank you”? There is no time to discuss about that. Always [the teacher’s] life is going on just like a stream of water, [and] the anja’s life is going just like a stream of water. So very naturally there is something, a harmonious life, a wonderful life, blooming. I didn’t realize that at the time, but [I felt it]. Intellectually I didn't know it, but feeling, I [could] know it. There is a wonderful mood, just like a flower blooming. And then through this, there is a big world, it is interconnected. So there is communication between teacher and my life, and I can learn a lot from this situation. 

But really, if you behave in even a slightly "showy" way, it’s not real Zen practice, because there is an egoistic sense, so it doesn’t fit to the Zen practice. So that's why he said, “This is the everyday food and drink of a patch-robed monk.” 

##### 34:15

“Getting to where he cuts off the myriad streams,” this is sort of, the myriad streams means the worldly affairs. Getting up in the morning, and wash your face, and go to work, and going to zazen, and performing Buddhist service, and washing the clothes, and having breakfast; lots of streams there. 

So, “Getting to where he cuts off the myriad streams, he is free to arise in the east and sink in the west, to go against or to go with, in any and all directions, free to give or to take away.” That means, I already told you, getting to where he cuts off the myriad streams. How can you cut off that sort of cause of creating new karma for the future? Well there is no particular way. All you have to do is, just like the anja’s duties. When he is leaving the temple, you should serve, you should take care of him. It’s not necessary to think, “he is adult,” “he is baby,” “he is my chief, boss,” or “I am student.” There is no chance to discuss about that. What happens very often in the myriad streams, in the human world, [is that] you are taught, “Why don’t you put [on] the socks by yourself? You have two hands.” *[laughter]* “So do it by yourself.” If you think so, you cannot take care of him in that way. So there is always some argument [or] complaint, don’t you think? That’s why it’s pretty hard. But there is no way to cut off [the myriad streams], if you do this always.

That’s why, how can you cut off the myriad streams? Just that you have to tune into the teacher’s life and teacher’s behaviors and teacher’s feelings, and [then] you can understand pretty well what he is wanting to do. So serve it, and help him, and take care of it. At that time, his life is going very smoothly, and also my life is going very smoothly, without any gap. So that is the best way to cut off the myriad streams. Because [in the] myriad streams, there [are] lots of things that come up; complaints, troubles, and arguments, and right or wrong, good or bad. So ... the Zen teacher scolded me when I was looking for the right thing, the rag, because that is common sense – it was right, but it’s not *right*. So you have to pay careful attention [to] *reality*. Is it urgent or is it emergency, or is it a very regular occurrence. At a glance, you have to judge it, and you have to do it. 

##### 38:05

“Getting to where he cuts off the myriad streams, he is free to rise in the east and sink in the west.” Any time, anywhere, you can go in the east, you can go in the west. That means, pick up the towel and clean it; because it is emergency. But anytime, anywhere, you can go west, you can go east. But according to common sense, when you go west, that ‘wrong,’ he says. If you pick up the towel, it’s wrong. At that time it’s very difficult; you cannot take care of the emergent occurrences. So, you have to do something when emergency happens; even though emergency happens, we have to do something. 

##### 39:08

“He is free to arise in the east and sink in the west, to go against or to go with”; sometimes it’s against, it’s wrong. I am not recommending you to do something wrong. As much as possible, you should do something right. But sometimes, there is no time to discuss. It is right, or it is wrong. Just do it. We have to take care of reality. So to go against, or to go with, in any and all directions, we have to do. Wherever you may go, whatever the teacher, the old monks do, you can catch it, and do it, helping.

When there was... well, [Tatha?] Roshi talked about something like this. When the teacher was suffering from something, you should immediately help him. You shouldn’t look at him without doing anything. For instance, if the older monk is sweeping the yard, that is a very hard job. Then the young monks are standing around, and saying, “oh, he’s doing hard.” But that is not good, so he said, “Why don’t you do it, instead of looking at him?” 

##### 41:02

And then that [one] time, [a] student immediately stood up and came to me, I am sitting high on the platform; I was translator, interpreter. So immediately he stood up and came to me, stood up in front of me, and said, “Shall I help you?” Well, I didn’t understand what he wanted to help [with]. *[laughter]* He said, “I want to help you translating.” Oh, wonderful... But I knew, he cannot speak Japanese. *[laughter]* So I said, “Thank you. Please sit down.” This is not... *[laughter]* Do you understand? It is emergency, it is helping somebody, but, you should know the situation, okay? *[more laughter]* But, feeling, I really appreciate his kind, gentle, compassionate mind; that’s why I said, “Thank you.” Anyway, “Please, sit down.”

##### 42:26

It is not helping the teachers, and all the monks. So “to go against or to go with, in any and all directions, free to give or to take away.” Sometimes, he scolds you, the teacher scolds you. Completely take you away; even though you are doing something right, he take away you. And he makes you pay attention to what you are doing. Intellectually “I am doing right,” but it’s not right; because that ‘right’ doesn’t fit the situation. At that time is doesn’t make sense… For instance, somebody says, immediately on the verge of life and death on the street, what should you do? There is a time to think, “Shall I go, or shall I stay?” Or “shall I move, shall I take just one step toward here? Or shall I help?” I am Buddhist, I am Christian, but there is no chance. Whoever you are, you’re Christian, you’re Buddhist, or whatever happens, you immediately rush into it, take him away. 

##### 44:03

So, “free to give or to take away. But say, at just such a time...” This is a Zen term, “at just such a time,” or sometimes, “at this very moment.” “At this very moment” means right in the middle of the unstructured[?] activity. Lively activities. “At that time,” that is “at this very moment,” there is no chance to discuss verbally or intellectually. Before you feel something, well, you have to do. That is “emergent,” “emergency.” That is reality. Your body, your mind must fit to the reality, before the reality is dichotomized in two; “I” and “someone.”

##### 45:19

That is “at just such a time” as this very moment, “whose actions are these?” Who acts? I act? Or my action should be accepted by my teacher? No way. There is no “I”. There is no “my object,” what is called “my teacher.” So, all I have to do is, my whole body and mind, just fit in, tune in to his mind, just always, just like pulling weed[?] ... pop[?] At that time you become one with somebody. 

##### 46:14

This is the “at this very moment.” Before the reality is dichotomized in two. Well, always we have the five skandhas. We say... 

*[tape change]*

... so what you can see, what you can hear, all things, that is a form. Form is something which is formed. By what? Feelings, perceptions, impulses, consciousness. Simultaneously. This is a form. Before the reality is formed, before you take the reality in a position of form, anyway you have to do. That is “at this very moment.” That is reality. Reality is not... a certain time, or it’s not a certain place, or it’s not something a person does. The unity of a person, place, and time - opportunity. It is not dichotomized between time and man and occasion and place. All three are unified perfectly, and work. At that time, this is reality. In the reality there are three things at least: man, opportunity and place. But according to five skandhas, it means “our body and mind,” immediately reality is dichotomized in two. “I.” “My teacher,” is old man... I am young man, student, his student. So, that is dichotomized.

##### 48:32

Immediately we dichotomize, but we are stuck there. That is a problem. Even the dichotomize... well, dichotomize is also one of the... something which is going on in the stream of life. Constantly changing and moving, constantly. So, when you dichotomize, put it aside. All you have to do is pay attention to reality, unified by time, man, and place. Just do it. At that time, your compassionate attention really penetrates, from the top of your head to the tip of your toes, and you can handle. Even though at that time, you don’t satisfy; but, it’s great matter [mud?], which will [shoot?] in the future. This is the best *[unintelligible]* 

##### 49:38

That’s why, “Who’s actions are these? Look into Hsueh Tou’s trailing vines.” Vine is always growing with pine trees; pine trees and other trees. But, sometimes trees die by vines, because too much. Vine means dichotomy. We can do always. Words, feelings, perceptions, impulses, consciousness. But when you do zazen, you’re aware of feelings, or perceptions, consciousness, and your experience. What do mean? We have to [be] aware of your feelings, and the emotions in zazen, on purpose. This is already nothing but something dichotomized by your five skandhas. If you do this, your zazen is really deluded. Even though you feel good, that good doesn’t last for long. Because, it’s pretty easy to stumble by it, and in[?] the next moment. Even though you say, “oh, that’s good concentration,” it is always stumbling over, by it. Don’t you think so? If you really think “good concentration,” saying “I experience good concentration,” that is awareness, don’t you think? But such awareness is not real awareness. Real awareness is no trace of awareness, when you become one completely with full concentration on your zazen, breath, et cetera. That is perfect awareness. So there is no chance to dichotomize by your five skandhas. “I” did, “I” concentrate pretty good, or “I” concentrate badly. There is no chance. That is reality. The “you,” and your object, and place; all things must be unified, and ... (?)

##### 52:35

Sometimes vines, trailing vines, there is something interrupted. So, trees sometimes die. But on the other hand, vine is also one of the beings, so it grows. But when vines grow with pine trees and other trees, it is beautiful, because there is one of the nature. But if it grows too much, it’s very dangerous, because it kills the tree. Do you know that happens in California? Do you know that? In California, lots of vines, a family of vines, sometimes… it kills the trees.
