Case 43: “Tung Shan’s No Cold or Heat – Talk 1”

The pointer:

> Ten thousand ages abide by the phrase that determines heaven and earth. Even the thousand sages cannot judge the ability to capture tigers and rhinos. Without any further traces of obstruction, the whole being appears everywhere equally.
>
> If you want to understand the hammer and tongs of transcendence, you need the forge and bellows of an adept.
>
> But say, since ancient times has there ever been such a family style or not? To test I’m citing this old case: look!
>

> Ten thousand ages abide by the phrase that determines heaven and earth.

From century after century, the phrases given by the buddhas and ancestors really penetrate the core of human being, not only explaining the surface of the human world, but the whole universe. So that’s why even the simple phrase, simple [statement], is handed down from generation to generation, which is very worthy of contemplating. 

For instance, this very famous [story],

When Bodhidharma went to China to teach Buddhism, first of all, he meant Emperor Wu. Emperor Wu asked Bodhidharma, “I have built lots of Buddhist temples and educated monks and Buddhist nuns. What is the merit?” And then Bodhidharma said, “No merit.”

Emperor Wu didn’t understand “no merit”, so he continued to ask “If Buddhist teaching is no merit, why do we study Buddhist teaching?” It didn’t make sense for Emperor Wu, that’s why he asked, “What is the essence of Buddha’s teaching?” So Bodhidharma said, “Vastness; nothing.” The vastness of no holiness, and vastness of nothing. 

This statement was very impressive because he didn’t understand, but he felt something, so he continued, “If there is nothing and vastness of the universe, existence, that is the essence of Buddhism – if so, who are you?” Who is this little guy in front of Emperor Wu? So he asked, “Who are you?” And Bodhidharma said “I don’t know,” because even Bodhidharma is completely nothing holy, just vastness of existence. 

So that is a very simple statement: “nothing holy; just vastness.” But this is a very impressive statement, so from generation to generation, still we have to continue to think about this. It has been handed down from generation to generation, because it is not merely words, it comes from Bodhidharma’s true heart. He really touches the core of existence. 

The core of existence is really quiet, silent – but pretty active. Very vast, because it is always embracing the whole thing. But according to human speculation we consider, that is kind of contradictory, embracing everything in peace and harmony. That is called existence. So that’s why it’s vast. “Nothing holy” – no discrimination there. 

So “Ten thousand ages abide by the phrase that determines heaven and earth.” What is the human world, what are human beings? What are the trees and the birds, skies, heaven, earth? What is the beginning of the world? What is the end of the world? Completely this simple phrase ... to the heaven and earth.

> Even the thousand sages cannot judge the ability to capture tigers and rhinos. 

If you want to get the tiger, you have to get into the tiger’s cave. And then if you create a certain gap, in other words slacken, then the tiger eats you. So you cannot sleep, you cannot make a psychological crack. But you cannot always keep tension. So you have to be relaxed, but not the relaxation you believe. So that is, if you say relaxation, it is already a crack, through which cold wind blows. On the other hand, you should be serious and have tension; if you have tension, it is also a crack through which wind blows in. So whatever you say, it is a crack. If you have a crack, the tiger attacks you. But you cannot escape from this, because you want to get perfectly spiritual peace and harmony. Whatever kind of occupation you follow or whatever lifestyle you have, consciously or unconsciously human beings really want to get that peaceful security. ... security in human life. So that is exactly you are already in the tiger’s cave. So you have to get the tiger. How can you get the tiger? This is ancestors and buddhas teaching expressed in words, and also practically, ancestors and buddhas guide their disciples to enter nirvana, which means perfect peace. 

So that’s why it says, “Even the thousand sages cannot judge the ability to capture tigers and rhinos.” Because even the sages judge this ability, how big or large this ability is, because this ability is always working, and always affecting somebody, always penetrating its object and helping all sentient beings, dynamically, from moment to moment. It’s really vast. So even the Buddha, even the sages cannot just this ability, how big it is, how great it is, because it is completely beyond human words. Because you are in the tiger’s cave. There is no crack to explain how you deal with this capability to get the tiger. Right in the middle of the tiger’s cave, there is no space. So all you have to do is, you must be alive with the tiger.

> Without any further traces of obstruction, the whole being appears everywhere equally.

Obstruction means crack through which cold wind blows in. Particularly when you inhale and exhale, you feel your tension slacked. When you inhale, well it’s alright, but when you exhale, you feel relaxed. At that time, it’s pretty easy to create a crack. And through this crack a cold wind blows in; that means your enemies, your partners attack you. The tiger attacks you immediately. And also when you inhale, you really have tension, and keep yourself as you are. Keep yourself in peace and harmony, keep yourself away from others, away from tigers. So very naturally you create tension. So inhale, it’s alright, but a little bit there is a danger because it creates tension. But exhale, it’s wonderful, you feel relaxed, but it’s pretty easy for us to create a crack. That’s why inhalation, exhalation is very important for us. Through which you can know what’s going on there, who you are. That’s why we concentrate on breathing: inhalation, exhalation. 

So, that’s why the concentration on exhalation, inhalation, should be an abstraction for your zazen. It’s just inhalation and exhalation must go in and out very smoothly, but it doesn’t mean ignore inhalation and exhalation. You should awake to it, but you shouldn’t create any tension or excessive relaxation for exhalation or inhalation. So that is a little bit difficult, because it is something functioning, and you must be there. So it is a little difficult to explain, so you should really experience through this. So without any further traces of obstruction, the whole being appears everywhere equally. At that time you can manifest you as you are through exhalation and inhalation, but not only you, the whole world can be manifested. It is really true. But we don’t know, our consciousness cannot reach anyway. But if you do this, completely, it is real fact, real reality, you can really manifest yourself and simultaneously the whole world, equally. 

So that’s why if you do zazen, physically there are two point you have to do. Physically you have to do zazen with your effort. And also with your effort means physically and mentally too. Anyway you should do zazen with your body. But with your effort, you have really concentrated on doing zazen. This is that which zazen is seeing from your point, your perspective. But simultaneously,
