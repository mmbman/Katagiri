... I talked about the practice of mindfulness on the basis of observing the body as impure. But this practice must be understood more deeply than as usual. As usual means as a moral sense. Yesterday I mentioned Dogen Zenji’s deep understanding of whta the human body is. The human body is completely beyond pure or impure. So he says the body you are observing is nothing but a bag of skin, but simultaneously it is the universe, the entire whole world. But entire whole world is considered as according to Dogen’s term the total dyanmic working. Generally speaking its nothing but motion, function. So Dogen Zenji uses the entire whole world, that means your body is melted away into the total dynamic working. For instance if you are right in the middle of function of the flower, you are sucked in, you disappear. Just like a black hole in the universe: all sucked in, we don’t know what’s going on in there. But this is nothing but nothing but motion and energy and constantly working ... This is, we say temporarily, the entire whole world. Your body is a bag of skin, when you see from your naked eye, temporarily we say, “Oh, human body is here.” But strictly speaking, next moment your body is sucked in by total dynamic working. But next moment your body is sucked in by total dynamic working. So next moment you don’t know. Your body has disappeared. That means total dynamic working; function. That is called entire whole world. So you return to, we say, return home and sit in peace and harmony, return to this total dynamic working. Your body, your nose, each pore, your breath, anyway return to this. Total dynamic working. So that’s why you don’t know what’s going on there. You don’t know. 

And then this, the total dynamic working, is something difficult to understand or to see, because no form, no colors, no smell – just working. So that’s why we can see it only through various form, so-called human body, or physical activity, or mental activity, or thought, or trees, whatever it is. Through those forms ... and then we can see total dynamic working within that. So always there is a form, but simultaneously no form, that’s why no form means form return to total dynamic working, so no form. That’s why “emptiness is form, form is emptiness.” 

#### 5:50

Ryokan Zen Master was asked by the disciples, “What do you think about life and death,” when he was about to die. He said, “A maple leaf, showing its back and front. It is falling.” Can you see this? A maple leaf showing it’s back and front; it is falling... means there is only total working, so-called *to be falling*. But it’s pretty difficult to see, to understand that activity or motion, so-called *to be falling*. How do we know? So we should know it through the form, so called showing it’s front, sometimes it’s the back. That is purity or impurity. In the process of this entire watching, at the moment it’s back is shown in this moment, at this moment the back returns to total dynamic working. That means the form of the back is melted away into process of total dynamic working. So next moment, *[unintelligible]*. The front is also melted away next moment into total dynamic working, so-called falling. So nothing. Front, no front. Back, no back. What’s that? That is called total dynamic working, just falling.

This is called “who dies?” We don’t know who dies. Maple leaf dies? No. Water in the ocean dies? No. What dies? We don’t know. Even though we don’t like it, we always show front and back. Even though we don’t like it, we have to show the back. Even though we like the front, but the front does not appear. Who controls this? We don’t know. But our intellect wants to know who does: who orders, who controls. That’s why this is ... Finally we say, “divinity does.” Certain governor, controller. Two watches there: front or back, purity or impurity. In the middle, the watchmaker is there. The watchmaker controls this one, and the two of them are exactly working togehter simultaneously, showing exact time. So he has to control. That is ... Could also be psychology. But reality of human existence is comletely beyond who does, whatever you say. Watchmaker? Watchmaker himself is also showing the front and back, front and back. This is life and death. So who does? You say divinity who lives somewhere. What is that? That is nothing but the idea of ... entinity ... So finally what is it? So finally whatever you say, whatever you make ideas, whatever establish wonder philosophical system, the mansions appear, next moment disappear. All are sucked in, just functioning. Completely beyond you like or dislike. So that’s why Ryokan says life and death is just a maple leaf. Maple leaf is his life, his death. ... just a leaf. How ... Ryokan’s life as a maple leaf shows, teaches us. Nothing special; just showing its front and back. And constantly it is falling. That’s it.

#### 11:45

So Dogen Zenji uses this term so-called the entire universe of the ten directions. This is a techincal term always in Buddhism uses this term. Ten directions means not only spatial dimensions but dimension in time too. Completely ... So What is the universe, what is universal life? Universal life is nothing but the entire total dynamic working, funciton. That’s it. 

So very naturally Dogen Zenji mentions that is your body which is called the body you are observing. What are you observing? You are observing two things: one is nothing but the back of the skin, the other the entire universe of the ten directions, even though you don’t know it. What is it? This is that body which you are observing is that which is vividly jumping along. That’s why he says living, or jumping along. Or hopping along. This is a characteristic of the entire universe of the ten directions. 

So your body is just like that. But you always see that your body is just like, my body ... form. But it’s very difficult for us to see that our body which is vividly jumping along, or vividly living. We don’t see it. That why Dogen Zenji has to say, continually, and also we have to listen to it constantly, again and again, a thousand times, a million times. Otherwise it doesn’t penetrate your body. You don’t understand it. 

#### 14:50

And also, if our body is just like something vividly living, which nothing is pinned down, if so what is the practice of mindfulness? Observing the body as impure? Very naturally I have to say, first of all you should accept your body beyond idea of purity or impurity. Nothing but being vividly living. Entire universe of ten directions. And then from moment to moment you can show the front and the back, front and the back, purity or impurity. It depends on you. It depends on you and also it depends on the circumstances you can create. It depends on your effort, and also it depends on circumstances you make every possible effort to create. 

So sometimes you can show the front. According to your effort, according to your circumstances, sometimes – but sometimes not. So circumstances are huge, circumstances. 

So it depends on you, your effort, your circumstances, but still there is questionables. Who makes the effort? ... What are the circumstances? What are the circumstances you have made? That is also questionable because finally you don’t know what circumstances you have made. And you don’t know the effort you have made. So all things return to total dynamic working. So all becomes zero. So that is, what is this? That is the practice of mindfulness, based on observing hte body as impure? Yes it is. Because our return to the total dynamic working which causes all forms to be zero. To be zero means you and zazen and there is no gap between. Rythm of zazen, rhythm of you, becomes one, exactly nothing, no space to bring and form, any ideas into it, because rhythm of zazen, rhythm of you, completely working together, there is only thing that is called total dynamic working between the two. So, no gap between. That is called returning to total dynamic working, or shikan. Or shamanta. Samadhi. Zazen is a particular practice, very precise practice, you can get into, you can participate in exactly. It is a little easier to do zazen rather htan expierience samadhi in usual everyday life, because circumstances, you body and you mind are completely ready to do this. But everyday life is a little difficult. But still in your everyday life we can still experience this. How? So, please practice *mindfulness*. it means, be calm. Have one-pointedness. Please practice one-pointedness. When you’re washing the dishes, please do it. Just wash the dishes. That is very calm. When you just do it, it is called samadhi shamata. You can stop; shamata means stop something, cease something. So you can cease. Quiescence and cease. Quiescence means to cease, to cease you thoughts, noisiness, and be one with washiung dishes. Be one with the dishes, that means oneness of you and dishes means what? Motion, so-called washing. Just wash. Just likea  washing machine, just constantly washing. That’s it. At that time, you become very calm, before you are conscious of it you become very calm, because you’re exactlyt one with. That is called shamata. Everyone can experience like this. Sweeping the grounds, wiping the floor, doing gassho, you can do it. 

And then how can you know that? How can you do it? How can you experience that shamata exactly, perfect quiescent? How can you stop or cease your thoughts, when you wash the dish? 

### Part 2

... There is in common sense something wrong, but broadly speaking, it is very good for us. Because in a spiritual sense, failure is simultaneously success. Failure is development and growth. Because failure and success all return to functioning ... All are melted away into total working and creating new thing. That is called development. So develpoment comes from not only success we believe. Total development or growth comes from total dynamic working. Into which failure, sucess are melted away. And then, development comes up. This is called emptiness, we say emptiness. So emptiness is not pessimistic. Or zero, we say, or we can say energy. It is zero, but simultaneously something happens, that’s why the end is a beginning. Terminal station is the beginning of life. You can go anyplace. 

And also we can experience that practice in our everyday life. For this, this is called shamata, and vipassana. And that is really great for us, through sweeping the floors and grounds, you can do it. Just concentrate; make you mind calm, and simultaneously making your mind calm is to see clearly simultaneously the edge of the human world, completely beyond your perception, simultaneously. The beginning of shamata is simultaneously the end of the human world. So you can touch it ... That’s why if you do zazen, very naturally it’s development, your life is really developing very much. You don’t know when your life is developing; we don’t know. But constatnly developing, anyway. And growing. It’s really true. Physically and mentally, it’s growing. But only if you see, if you practice it, always there is something extra, so-called dirty water there. That’s why you dont’ feel good. Behind the dirty water, there is still total dynamic working there. I always say climbing the mountain: mountain itself is constantly beautiful, but when you start climbing the mountain, it’s really dirty water there, hard work, easy work, risking your life. And then many questions come up: why do you have to climb the mountain, risking your life? It’s ridiculous for you. But you cannot stop it. So what causes you to climb the mountain? You don’t know. Of course there is your effort, but your effort is nothing but showing just your back, the back of your life. Next moment, you don’t know. That is nothing but the front of your life. So finally you don’t know; finally what you have to do is [say,] “I just climb the mountain.” That is just moving, functioning. And then when functioning, very naturally ther is lots of dirty water ... so-called hard work. Boredom. Hatred. Many things come up. And then most people quit. But forgetting ... behind the dirty water, still there is a fish which is vividly sleeping there. Presense of fish there, constantly, that is beauty of the mountain. Later Dogen Zenji mentions like that. 

So that’s why for this we have to practice like this. We have to see the back of skin, but simultaneously there is the universe. Your skin, your body is the universe. So constantly you have to walk around, working on this. How? Zazen is typical, simple practice for us. And then you can practice also in your everyday life. 

Do you have questions?
