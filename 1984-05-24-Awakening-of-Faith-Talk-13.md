**Katagiri Roshi:** The other day, I mentioned the meaning of the first sentence, that the mind is phenomenal, samsara is grounded on the *tathagatagarbha*. In other words, I mentioned the meaning of the ground on which the samsara is produced, from where samsara comes, how samsara is produced. At that time I mentioned, I gave ... Usually we [understood] in samsara coming from the truth, absolute truth itself. But according to the absolute itself, it is impossible for us to think samsara coming from the absolute itself. So finally, the discourse on the Awakening of the Mahayana Faith gets the idea of *tathagatagarbha*.

This *tathagatagarbha* is the teaching, after investigating again and again the human life in reality, instead of human life in samsara, is analyzed philosophically or metaphysically, and try to understand from where the samsara comes. I don’t think this is the attitude towards human being in this book. Buddhism always directly faces human life, samsara, in reality as it is. That is the most important attitude towards human life Buddhism always mentions. 

Because the absolute itself is something which is very difficult to understand. Logically or emotionally, it’s impossible to know what the absolute is, as one. Because it is very vast. Very difficult. 

But we know that the absolute itself is omnipresent. Wherever you may be, whoever you are, all sentient beings are exactly grounded on the absolute. The truth, or the same and one ground. And then it is possible for all sentient beings to be. Without the absolute or the truth, it is impossible for us, for beings, for all sentient beings to live. That is the truth or the absolute. 

But in Buddhism we don't use the truth or absolute. Instead of those terms, we use *suchness* or *thusness*. Suchness, thusness is, what is just is, something like that. Or as-it-is. That is the truth. 

So suchness and thusness is a little more concrete explanation of the truth or absolute, of being close between human beings, human life. So if you use the truth or absolute, it is pretty far away from us. But thusness or as-it-is-ness is pretty close to us. 

So that is the Buddhist term, thusness and as-it-is-ness. In Japanese we say *shi-myo*. *Shi* means the truth, *myo* is that. “Looks like”, literally “looks like.” Two meanings, myo means two meanings, one is “looks like”, the other one is “exactly”, exactly something as it is. Exactly as it is. Total manifestation of something as it is. That is the meaning of myo, thusness, we say thusness in English. 

So, absolute truth is pretty difficult to say. If you point out this is absolute, it is no longer absolute. So that’s why it’s very difficult. Absolute or truth means one, oneness. Which two beings creating, two beings live together, in peace and harmony. That is one, oneness. That is called truth or absolute. But it’s very difficult to explain what absolute is. So very naturally, the absolute or truth is something like, something, something, looks like, looks like a truth, looks like a truth but it’s not truth. Looks like. But if we can experience the fish, birds and sky, Dogen Zenji mentions in the Genjokoan, the birds and the sky. Birds manifest itself, the oneness between the birds and the sky, that is oneness, means the truth. But there are in the truth, within the manifestation of the truth, there are two beings exist, birds and sky. But if a bird flies, very naturally the bird creates oneness. Birds life is really going in the absolute, becoming one always between the birds and the sky. Intellectually if you see it, there are two, birds and sky. But in terms of oneness, bird is not exactly bird: bird is sky, sky is bird. That's why a bird looks like a bird, but it’s not a birds – it is sky. Sky looks like sky but it is not sky, because sky is exactly birds. So that's interconnection, interpenetration there. 

So that's why *myo* means “looks like” and also “something manifested as it is”, directly. That is myo, of shi-myo. 

So, very naturally from the *tathagatagarbha*, samsara is produced. Means *tathagatagarbha* is another expression for the truth, or for the ultimate pure nature of the mind. Veiled with, veiled in delusion. This is *tathagatagarbha*. 

Manifest, it is always the present in every being, tables, chairs, floors, flowers. In every being we can see the truth. But that truth is not exactly absolute truth, because it is in every being. So it is kind of a limited [...] truth. So that's why in the idea of the *tathagatagarbha* , truth is “veiled in delusion”. “In delusion” means already the truth is limited, the truth is manifested [...] in certain being: tables, human beings, birds, et cetera. So that's why, because there is no other way to know absolute itself, without realizing the truth in every being. So that’s why this book is called “[Define] the Term *tathagatagarbha*”. 

So *tathagatagarbha* is the teaching that all sentient beings are already a buddha, regardless of whether you realize or not. In terms of Buddha’s eye, in terms of universal perspective. In the universal perspective, we are already buddha. We are already buddha. That is *tathagatagarbha* . Not absolute truth – “we are buddha” means you are buddha, that existence of buddha, the bell is buddha, flower is buddha, and so on. All are buddha. [That is the meaning of] *tathagatagarbha*. Regardless of whether you are conscious of it or not, it is the truth because in terms of Buddha’s eye, in the universal perspective, this is the truth. That’s why this book teaches us we are buddha, saying *tathagatagarbha*. 

So still a little bit the abstract term, philosophical term. Next, we have to understand how *tathagatagarbha* works in our human life. That’s why next, this book has another term, *alayavijnana*. 

So very naturally, *vijnana* means mind... not mind, consciousness. So this book has another term, a different term, *alayavijnana*, in order to explain how *tathagatagarbha* works in us. 

So *alayavijnana* is almost the same meaning as *tathagatagarbha*, but *alayavijnana* is closer idea of understanding *tathagatagarbha*. More *intimate* expression or intimate term, in order to understand what *tathagatagarbha* is. So *alayavijnana* is the consciousness which has two aspects, one is absolute, the other one is samsara. Samsara and absolute. Truth and absolute. And then this is mainly *alayavijnana* focuses on human life in reality. In other words, you have to face human life in reality. How it is going. What is human life. So very naturally, to tell the truth, if you look at your life, it’s very difficult for us to believe that our life is really buddha, or the absolute. So very naturally, if you look at your life honestly, our life is really covered with delusion. That is called *ignorance*. So *alayavijnana* kind of has ignorance. 

If so, why is it that this discourse [says] that samsara is produced by ignorance, instead of by *tathagatagarbha*? So, why don’t you say about samsara produced by ignorance? Because honestly if you look at human life, human life is exactly covered with ignorance. So this is also [klesha], in the same as the absolute. But ignorance is, I mentioned before ignorance is not “original sin”. We usually consciously or unconsciously believe [that], but ignorance is not original sin. In Buddhism ignorance is *no root*.

So in the Vimalakirti Sutra, if you read the Vimalakirti Sutra, Vimalakirti mentions that the good comes from no root. Ignorance, any kind of delusions, have no root. And then finally the Bodhisattva asked Vimalakirti, “From where [does] no root come?” So finally Vimalakirti says, “No root comes from no root.” anyway. But we believe no root is somewhere, something which exists somewhere. But *no root* is exactly *no root*. 

So *ignorance* is characterized by *no root*. In other words, you don’t know from where it comes. So we say *beginningless*. If it is beginningless, I think it is endless also. 

So this is a very interesting point. Beginningless ignorance, and endless ignorance. We have to think about this. 

So [...] First, if you think ignorance is a kind of original sin, produced by somebody or something, at that time it’s easy to ask somebody to adjust or to correct or to eliminate, to remove. But if there is no beginning, there is no one or nothing you should ask to adjust. Nothing. Because it is beginningless. Simultaneously, if it is beginningless, simultaneously it is endless. So you don’t know how it is going. So beginningless and endless is nothing to ask somebody or nothing to do for it. So this is an interesting point.

But, when the time is ripe and conditions arranged, something happens. 

For instance, ignorance is the kind of energy which puts you in a deluded world, constantly. While you are deluded, you don’t understand how much you are deluded. So you don’t realize. Just like a dream, or just like sleep. If you sleep, you don’t know you are sleeping. And also, while you are sleeping, you cannot try to wake up. Because when you try to wake up, at that time you are wake up already. Because you get up from the sleep. So while you are sleeping, you don’t know you are sleeping. But right in the middle of sleeping, if you can think that I try to wake up, at that time you are not sleeping. Do you understand? You are conscious of it. So very naturally, you cannot try to wake up. But when something happens, when something is there, then you can wake up. 

That is in the Buddhism, [...] means time and occassion and cause and secondary cause – first cause, secondary cause, and the condition. So *jisetsu innen*, the *ji* means time, *setsu* means the occasion, *in* means the cause, *nen* means the condition. When the *jisetsu innen* are ripe and arranged, you can wake up. 

But how can you get *jisetsu innen*, time, occasion, and cause, and conditions? 

This is our practice. When the time comes, you can wake up. When the time comes in the morning, 4 o’clock, or 4.30, you can wake up. Even though you don’t have a waking bell, well, when the time comes, you can wake up. But that waking up doesn’t come from your intention. Anyway, when something happens, you can wake up. 

So, many conditions there. But human being are a little bit complicated. Time, occasion, and cause, and condition – [...]. Change of mind, change of consciousness. And lots of heredity, and memories, and customs, which you have accumulated in the past, [are] connected with this. And then, you can have already time, occasion, and conditions, and cause, that you have accumulated already, and also you can create time, and occasion, and cause, and condition for future. Anyway, day by day, you create. You live in a certain time and occasion, but on the other hand, you create new time and occasion. 

So, when you sleep, you don’t know why you sleep. But on the other hand, you can wake up, anyway. 

So, when you have a little tension before you go to bed, “I have to get up tomorrow morning.” If you have a tension, kind of these circumstances, very naturally you can wake up when the time comes. 30 minutes before, or 10 minutes before, 5 minutes before, you can wake up. But when you go home and sleep, what’s the difference? Do you understand? Quite difference. Even though time comes, you still feel sleepy. But when you’re here, before time comes, you can wake up. And even though you wake up, you don’t feel so sleepy. Don’t you think so? So, a little bit complicated situation there. 

But, *mumyo*, ignorance, means that it is something you cannot try to wake up, because you already do it, you are already going astray in this deluded world. But when the time comes, and when the time is ripe, the conditions arranged, you can wake up. So, all we have to do is, we try to create and produce a nice time, a nice condition, a nice occasion, et cetera. And then, those new time and occasion can help you to wake up. 

So that is the *mumyo*. So, *mumyo* means exactly beginningless, and endless. 

So that is the *alayavijnana*. So, from this point, it’s impossible for us to think samsara comes from *mumyo*. No. Because ignorance, mumyo, is beginningless. Because samsara exists on the same and one ground, anyway. Which “same and one ground” means the basic state of existence which is going constantly. This is the same and one ground. 

For instance, when you were born in this world, and then you have grown up to the 20, 25, anyway, when you look back your past, you can see there are lots of changes of your life, physically and mentally, lots of changes. But change, idea of change, doesn’t exist ignoring the existence of the same and one ground, basically. So, unconsciously or consciously, there is already the same and one ground, which makes a change possible to be. Do you understand? What makes it possible for change to work. 

So, that is the same and one ground. So that’s why, without this we cannot exist. Without this, samsara cannot exist. 

So that’s why it’s impossible for us to think samsara [is] coming from ignorance. Because ignorance is beginningless. No, it’s not the same and one ground. So, that’s why very naturally it comes from *tathagatagarbha*, and psychologically speaking it is called *alayavijnana*.

Alright. And also one more point is, “diffuses harmoniously with” means *wa go* in Japanese, “peaceful gathering,” literally. We say *wa go*: *wa* means “peace”, *go* means “together”. So, “peaceful gathering”. In English we say “peace and harmony”. But in this book it says “to diffuse harmoniously with”. 

So this characteristic of *wa go* is [a] very interesting idea, because constantly it is like pure water. If you put the red ink, whole water becomes red. And then, next moment it becomes water again. Next moment, when you put the blue ink, whole situation becomes blue. So, whatever it is, it becomes blue or red, always it is the water. Same base, same foundation. So, when it’s blue ink shows, whole world is blue. That’s it. That is all. Next moment, it shows red ink, and then whole world is red. But that is the same base; both have the same base, so-called water. 

So, by ignorance, that ignorance is kind of a wind. Wind comes, and very naturally wave comes up. Then next moment, if you wake up from the sleep, very naturally, that is [escape from] sleep, so-called ignorance. Because, wave comes to be calm, and return to normal situation of the water. So, very naturally, *wago* “peaceful together” means always show one act in a moment. At that time, whole world becomes red or blue. And next moment, that same base, so next moment, basically always that is water, pure. So if you make the red ink, simultaneously it becomes red, next moment you can be blue. Red ink doesn’t stay long. It’s melted into the water and disappears, dissipated. Melted away. So, red ink comes into, it doesn’t stay long, and melted away. Next moment, you can put the blue, and melted away. But, when you put the blue ink, immediately it’s influencing, so-called “watering”. Watering, influencing. But even the result, so-called “watering”, by which people are influenced, all that is melted away, into the water, and becomes pure water. So, next moment, you put the blue. Something like this. 

So that is samsara and also absolute truth are the interconnected interacting, like this. That is called “diffuses harmoniously with birth and death”, samsara. That is characteristic of *tathagatagarbha*, and also storehouse consciousness, psychologically. 

Okay, so, I want to say a little bit about the *tathagatagarbha*, the absolute and the tathagatagarbha. Something like this... Let’s imagine a guitar instrument, okay? In terms of the absolute, guitar is not a particular being, it is just a being, in the same as other beings. So, you can’t put a certain name on it. It’s just a being. It’s just a being, in terms of the universal point of view. It’s just a being. So, that is absolute, or truth, you can say. But on the other hand, this oneness, so-called, just a being, is something difficult to understand, because it’s vague. So, very naturally, what we can see is individual beings, individual particular beings: tables, the guitars, and the altar, and the floors, like this. That is a world we can contact with, you know, with our consciousness. That’s all. So, very naturally, with our consciousness, it’s impossible to know just a being, as one. So, very naturally, we can see difference, we can see the different aspects of the difference, not difference, the limits of the truth, limits of being as one, manifested in each individual being. Trees, birds, [guitars]. That’s why we put the name on it, so-called “guitar”, and through the guitar we can find being as a one. 

So, very naturally, guitar is *tathagatagarbha*. Guitar as a whole is *tathagatagarbha*. But a guitar, as a tathagatagarbha, is a different as being as a one. Do you understand that one? And then, next moment, anyway, tathagatagarbha, the so-called guitar, starts to work. At that time, it makes sound. That is samsara. If you touch, that is a string, and if you touch the string, then the guitar starts to move. The whole guitar, as a whole, starts to move. And that makes a sound. This is called samsara. 

But, simultaneously, strings getting calm and be quiet. But even though it becomes quiet, I don’t think sound disappears. Still, guitar as a *tathagatagarbha* still has great capability to work, to move, making a sound. Even though no sound, it doesn’t mean sound disappears. No. Still, sound is there. Voice, sound of the guitar, constantly there. So next moment, if you touch it, sound comes up. 

So there are life and death. Affirmative and negative. Affirmative means when you touch the guitar, tathagatagarbha starts to work, move, and then make a sound. That is affirmative. You can see, you can hear, but next moment, you have to understand, anyway, tathagatagarbha which doesn’t work. [That] means it’s quiet. But even though tathagatagarbha becomes quiet, making no sound, it doesn’t mean no sound. Still, there is possibility of sound there. So, very naturally, that is possibility of the sound which doesn’t appear, means negative. So always negative, affirmative there. Life and death. Happy or not happy.

 So when you feel happy, that is *samsara* world.
 
 *[Tape break.]*
 
 ... happy. Still, happiness there. So we should understand the samsara with two aspects, happiness and not happiness. Self-confidence or not self-confidence, always. 
 
 So that is the samsaric world. 
 
So, when the *tathagatagarbha* moves and vibrates, always it shows two aspects. Self-conscious and not self-conscious. Then through learning the both two aspects, and then you can understand the being as the one, through the guitar. That is the relationship among the truth [and] tathagatagarbha. 

And then, *alayavijnana* tries to explain how guitar works, how guitar creates sound. That is the structure of the guitar, structure of the *tathagatagarbha*. That is called *alayavijnana*. *Alayavijnana* tries to know structure of the *tathagatagarbha*, how *tathagatagarbha* works. How guitar works. That is, psychologically, this book uses *alayavijnana*. 

Do you have a question? Is that alright? 

Do you understand that a little different? 

**Question:** I have a question ignorance. Is ignorance also grounded on the absolute?

**Katagiri Roshi:** Uh, no. It is connected with the *tathagatagarbha*. *Alayavijnana*, psychologically speaking. Not *grounded*, because no ground. But it’s always involved in the *tathagatagarbha*.

**Same person:** But you said it couldn’t produce with the samsara, so... part of samsara. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Not *part* of *samsara*, it’s already you are right in the middle of ignorance. Samsara is not *part* of ignorance. Is that what you mean? Part of ignorance? 

**Same person:** Well, ignorance is being not samsara or somehow not the creator of samsara but ... well, I don’t quite know how to say it, but apart from samsara in some way. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Well, if you say “cause of samsara, that is ignorance”. But if I say cause of samsara, very naturally we set up a dualistic structure with the word. You, the world comes from ignorance, like this. But practically speaking, relationship between samsara and ignorance is not like that. Always same. Ignorance *is* samsara itself. But if you see samsara itself very seriously and very honestly, always looking at, if you look at the samsaric world in reality with, what you would say, glance? Very sharp. No... Insight? [...] With the gaze of insight. Very seriously, very naturally, you can see something by which samsara is produced. So that is, in a sense, still a bit intellectual, very intellectual understanding. Do you understand? Through the actual daily life, if you really see the human life with a very clear eye, clear mind, very naturally you can see the cause of the samsara. Even intellectually. And then that is, we put a name on it, so-called *ignorance*. But ignorance is, we don’t know from where it comes. 

And then practically, that ignorance appears as... what would you say? In Japanese, *ai* means “attachment”, very strong attachment and grasping. This is the contents of ignorance, practically speaking. And then if you look at that aspects of human life based on attachment and grasping, you can see a certain cause. That is, cause, ignorance. 

And then why ignorance is created? That means according to Twelve Chain Causation: before ignorance, nothing. First of all, Buddha brings up ignorance. Because when you are asleep, you don’t know the world before you sleep. You don’t know. Then after awakening, and then you can know. Do you understand? 

#### 51:50

*[Laughter.]*

**Question**: I was thinking, with samsara world, is this an awakening, you would be able to see the samsaric world. Well I would like to say, without ignorance, you’ve awakened from the sleeping or the dream. So in that sense, they can’t be the same, ignorance. The samsaric world always will be there because of the *tathagatagarbha*. Is that true?

**Katagiri Roshi:** When you wake up, and there is no ignorance? What you mean. 

**Same person:** I think that even with the clarity of an awakening, the samsaric world doesn’t change, you just see it differently. Whereas with ignorance, it’s more like your own perception... can that go away? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** It cannot go away. Because the interest stays between which is there. Because you are already sleeping. So, you don’t know. 

**Same person:** Well I guess I don’t understand then, about the difference between ignorance and samsara. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Ignorance means when you are asleep you don’t know the sleep. That is ignorance. 

So you don’t know the, before the sleep, and before the... you don’t know the world of sleep, and also the world before you sleep. You don’t know. In other words, here is a petition, okay? You wake up here, you are normal, and you get into the sleep, but you don’t know this one, before. How you can get into the sleep, you don’t know. It’s like a wonderful feeling. *[He chuckles.]* Particularly you do zazen... *[laughter]* and you concentrate, wonderful, and then, sometimes you feel good, you know? But that feeling good is, you don’t know from where it comes. It comes from perfect concentration, or getting into the sleep? You don’t know. 

Have you ever experienced this? I experience it pretty often. *[He chuckles.]* Concentration, pretty good, you know? Sometimes you feel good, wonderful, you know? But it’s not perfect concentration, it is exactly sleep. But I didn’t know that. Sleep or perfect concentration, we don’t know. *[He laughs.]* 

**Question:** When you wake up about ignorance, you don’t wake up from ignorance, you wake up about ignorance. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yeah, when you wake up, you can be free from sleep, anyway. But it doesn’t mean that ignorance disappears. Still, ignorance is endlessly there. That’s why we have to awaken to it. 

**Question:** Is says that in the Genjokoan, doesn’t it? About an enlightened person is enlightened about ignorance, not about enlightenment. 

**Someone else:** *[Inaudible.]*

**Question:** I can’t remember the exact line, but it had to do with completely awakening to ignorance, and not enlightenment. 

**Question:** Roshi, I have a question. You said the other day that the first thing we have to do is totally accept our object, before we do anything else. That’s what you said. Do you remember that?

**Katagiri Roshi:** [Mm-hmm.]

**Same person:** In order for me to do that, it requires great faith or great trust, to totally accept every object I encounter. And from where do you get this great faith and this great trust, to totally accept all these objects? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** I think you should have your own eyes enough to see the total panoramic picture of human world, and then you can accept totally. So you can totally accept doesn’t mean to accept objectively [...] So constantly there is some question that comes up, how much we should trust the object, et cetera. So always there is a between the subject and the object, always some problem comes up. That’s very common, very common. You cannot escape. 

But on the other hand, if there is a question, within the question, you have to trust and accept and deal with your object with a clear mind. And sometimes you devote yourself, sometimes you have a question comes up right in the middle of full devotion, a question comes up. That is always. But on the other hand, you cannot be [...] ecstatic, or intoxicated, you know, so-called total devotion. No. That is the *ignorance*, okay? *[He laughs.]* That’s why very naturally you can see some problems. [...] That’s why we have to nurture ourselves constantly, stand up straight and make your mind clear, always. That is our individual practice.

So, in the process of reaching to the spiritual stage, always some questions come up. How much I should devote? How much I should accept? But within that question, on the other hand, you have to completely accept and do [something]. Those two aspects come up. 

**Same person:** So, you’re saying full devotion.

**Katagiri Roshi:** Full devotion is not the full devotion you believe, because within the full devotion there is a question. How much? You make a question. How much I should trust the object, et cetera. Because that is the samsaric world. So, you live already in the samsaric world.

**Same person:** That’s not my idea of full devotion. My idea of full devotion is you don’t have any *room* for a question to come up.

**Katagiri Roshi:** Well, that is in terms of Buddha’s eyes, there is no space to think of it. So, just full devotion. But that doesn’t mean ignoring samsaric world. So, always there is a flashing light: is that correct? Or is that right? Or is that wrong? Always flashing light comes up. 

So, we have to check. Even though it is a flashing light. Sooner or later, it disappears, but it’s a flashing light. As long as it appears as a flashing light, it is something being, so we cannot ignore it. 

So, still there is “how much I should.” Some question comes up. But, strictly speaking, well, if you see that your object, you totally accept, in a sense. Totally accept. 

**Same person:** What do you do with those flashing lights? Just let them go, don’t you?

**Katagiri Roshi:** Huh?

**Same person:** What do you do with the flashing lights that come up? You just kind of let it come and go.

**Katagiri Roshi:** Well, a flashing light always appears and disappears, you know? But, it is not something we should ignore. Because it appears in front of you. So, you have to pay attention to it. 

So, in other words, within the total devotion, where there is no space to think, okay? There are always flashing lights, signals of flashing lights there. So, that is, well, samsaric world. But, in the Buddha’s eyes, completely there is total devotion. Because, whatever kind of flashing lights, when you come to the intersection you should stop it. Anyway, stop. Stop means accept the whole devotion, whole flashing lights. Red, blue, and yellows, anyway, accept totally. And that stop it. Totally acceptance. And then you can see the flashing lights, blue, red, and yellow, et cetera.

#### 1:02:45

And, one more point is, *samadhi* and also *spiritual intoxication*... what would you say? 

**Audience:** That’s it!

**Katagiri Roshi:** Samadhi and spiritual intoxication are quite different, alright? Do you understand that?

**Someone:** I don’t understand either of them.

**Katagiri Roshi:** Spiritual intoxication is still... it is not so bad, but... *[laughter]*... Still a little bit, you show the ignorant aspect of *tathagatagarbha*. *[He laughs.]* But, *samadhi* is exactly samadhi. Spiritual expectation, but, its samadhi-no. What it is? Aha, this is spiritual [expectation]. That is the samadhi. Samadhi is you just be there, but, you are sleeping, but you are not sleeping. You’re awake. It’s impossible intellectually, but it is possible with wisdom. So, you can do it. That is the samadhi. So, you just jump into it, but, you are clear. 

So, if you read the Diamond Sutra, the Bodhisattva is always right in the middle of darkness, but he is not blinded by the darkness, et cetera. The Diamond Sutra [says is that way]. 

So that’s why samadhi is very important for us. 

**Question:** Can I ask a question? I want to ask a question about intoxication in general, not necessarily spiritual intoxication. It seems to me like, one thing that happens to me is that I can see that I am intoxicated by something, and that there is a passionate grasping, but that, for some reason, I still have to act it out. Do you know what I mean? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Mm-hmm.

**Same person:** Like that passion in grasping still affects me, even though I can see that it’s affecting me. There is a question in my mind about how to deal with it. It always seems to me like I have to, like I say, hash it out. Even though I know that I’m being stupid, that I have to do it just to find out, to get to the next place. Do you know what I mean? Is there another way to deal with that? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Well, no. All you have to do is just realize, awaken to it, and then again and again you have to awaken it, because ignorance is always working, beginninglessly, endlessly. 

So, if you believe ignorance is always going so let’s forget it, you know, spiritual life and becoming Buddhas, at that time, ignorance runs wildly. So, very naturally, you have to deal with ignorance every day, from moment to moment, anyway. And then when you awaken to ignorance, at that time, well, it can be free from ignorance. In other words, as so far as awakening to ignorance, you can get the merit.

**Same person:** So it’s not really awakening, you just intellectually realize it. Awakening is something other than that?

**Katagiri Roshi:** Intellectually what? 

**Same person:** Realize...

**Katagiri Roshi:** Even though you intellectually realize it, and even intellectually, if you realize it, it’s fine. It is also pretty good. In other words, put the seed, plant the seed in the ground. That’s good. It’s better than nothing, anyway. So, very naturally, it will shoot, anyway. 

Later, this book mentions about that stuff [...] For now, a more complicated situation. Explanation comes up about the ignorance. And it’s very interesting if you study the step by step. But this is just the introduction. So you have to make clear each term. Otherwise, later you won’t understand them. That’s why I take lots of time to explain them.

Anyway, the Buddhist practice is emphasizing to awakening. But you don’t believe how important the awakening is. But for instance, if you eat food, one ball of rice, even though you eat one grain of rice, it makes your stomach full. Don’t you think so? So you have to eat the one grain of rice, anyway. Even though one by one, you should eat it. Do you understand? It seems to be so slow, but I don’t think it is slow. It’s very stable, step by step practice. 

But a human being doesn’t believe that, because human being always grasping [...] the whole thing. That is ignorance. Attachment, craving, grasping one bunch of rice, grabbing, you know. This is also pretty good, but on the other hand, human life can’t be dealt with in that way always. So, one by one, even though you eat a grain of rice, you should believe that it is making your stomach full. 

And also, at that time, a grain of rice which has been on your plate, disappears. That means [explication] disappears. If you eat a grain of rice, means awareness. Anyway, aware. That means eat a grain of rice. At that time, a grain of rice, which was on the tray disappears. Do you understand? And then, you can feel full of the stomach. 

But the human being believes that, because we are very crazy, very *rushy*. We have to practice step by step like this, because we should realize from the bottom of your heart, and samsara is grounded on, anyway, ignorance. So within the ignorant world, you cannot be grasping one bunch of rice and gulping. It’s alright, but it makes you sick sometimes. So, craving sometimes makes you sick. 

So one by one, anyway. That is very slow practice, but it is very stable, with clear awakening. 

That is Bodhisattva practice, if you read the Diamond Sutra, et cetera. “Sooner or later, you can awaken.” Yes, it is. You can awaken, you can be free from.
