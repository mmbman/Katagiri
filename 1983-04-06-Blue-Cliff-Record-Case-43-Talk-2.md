Today I would like to explain the Five Ranks of Soto Zen teaching. This is a kind of philosophical background, or Soto Zen teaching. Let’s look at page 307. 

Maybe the periods of development of Chinese Buddhism could be divided into three. Maybe first the first period of development of Chinese Buddhism was between the first century to the fifth century, during which the Buddhist texts were translated. That is the period of translating the Buddhist textbooks. And the second period is maybe the sixth century to the tenth century, during which the teaching of Buddhism in China, after translating the texts, was established, systematized. That is Chinese Buddhism: Tendai, and Avatamsaka School, and also also school means Buddhist psychology. And also Nirvana school, and also the [...] school; several schools were established in those days. And the third period is from the seventh century to the thirteenth century. Song and Tang dynasties.

During the first two periods, it was very difficult for the Chinese to experience directly the spirit of Buddhism, because during the first period of developing Buddhism, they really concentrated to translate Buddhist texts. And during the second period, they tried to systematize all the teachings of the Buddhist texts after translating them. So the philosophical system of Buddhism was already established, but still there was a lack of experiencing directly the spirit of Buddha’s teaching. And during the seventh century and eleventh century, the Song and Tang dynasties, Zen Buddhism was flourishing in those days, in order to experience the spirit of Buddhism directly. And then, very naturally, in the history of China, the five schools of Zen are found. 

But unfortunately, the more Zen Buddhism was flourishing, the more there were various understandings of the spirit of Zen Buddhism. So that’s why many schools were established. And then very naturally among those many schools, we are very confused, what is the essence of Zen Buddhism? Because it was too popularized, through various schools of Zen Buddhism. Look at the Japanese Buddhism: there are various schools in Japan, Zen schools, Tendai schools, Avasanga schools, and [...] schools, Shingon schools, tantric schools, et cetera. That means that how popular Buddhism has been among the people. The more Buddhism is popularized, the more there are some lack of developing the spirit of Buddhism, and also misunderstanding the spirit of Zen Buddhism. 

Do you understand? If something is very popularized, you have to explain using plain words, in order to appeal to people. So very naturally, Buddhism is gradually getting popularized, but on the other hand, you can easily lose the spirit of Buddhism. So I don’t know what is good; should you popularize Buddhism in the modern age, or should you preserve the original spirit of Zen Buddhism instead of trying to popularize Buddhism among modern people. I don’t know what is better, which is good, which is bad. But we cannot escape from both. You have to not popularize, you have to teach Buddhism to the people. On the other hand, when you try to teach Buddhism, you individually try to focus on preserving the original spirit of Buddhism. That is very important for us. But when Buddhism is very popular, famous, the people are really infatuated with it, because people believe that which is popularized is real Buddhism. I don’t think so; you have to be a little bit careful. Do you understand what I mean? 

So, Tozan Zen Master, who lived almost 9th century, he was born 8th or 7th century A.D., he tried to restore the original spirit of Buddhism. That is one reason why he established this teaching of the Five Ranks of Zen Buddhism. The second purpose is that he tried to unify the teaching of all five Zen Schools. In other words, beyond the teaching of the five schools of those days, what is the real essence of teaching, the spirit of Buddhism talked about by Buddha? Not teaching in terms of the teaching of each school. What is the real, original spirit of Buddhism, beyond the idea of denominations.

The same applies to Buddhism here in our days. Of course, in the beginning maybe Chinese Buddhism comes to America, and Japanese Buddhism comes to America, various Indian religions and philosophies comes to the United States. Tibetan Buddhism comes. But look at those Buddhisms. You’re really confused. What is the real Buddhism? If you try to learn Japanese Buddhism, you don’t like it, because it’s very stinky. And if you try to learn Chinese Buddhism, or Tibetan, or Indian, you cannot be satisfied completely. Because there are so many schools there, so very naturally you start looking around. That means you start to compare the Buddhism you have learned with others. Then you start to grope for the best Buddhism for you. But you never find it. So finally, just confusion is left. 

So I always tell you, the Buddhism you study is best. You don’t believe this, but for instance, the zazen you do. There are a hundred kinds of zazen, meditation, in this world. East Asian meditations, Western meditations, Catholic, Protestant... many kinds of meditation there, more than one hundred. And then among them you try to find the best meditation you want to do. No way to find the best one, because there are too many things. So finally you have to return to only one. That one is the meditation you are just devoting yourself into. That’s all. 

Gassho: If you study the ... mudra, it explains many kinds of gasshos. And also if you study the gassho under certain teachers, always every teacher gives you a different idea of type of gassho. What is ... gassho? 

So, very naturally, anything, not only Buddhism but whatever it is, if something is popularized, you can find something missing there. On the other hand, you cannot always preserve the original spirit of Buddhism or whatever, philosophy, without teaching, without opening it to the people. So there is some contradictory feeling there when you try. But we should be careful, anyway. 

So that’s why individually you really want to practice what? You really want to practice just simple practice, so-called zazen. Don’t you think so? Accepting the shifting complication of human life. Teaching and ceremony and philosophy, psychology, etc., anyway you just want a simple practice. So what you want to practice Buddhism is mainly not belong to the community, so-called Sangha, and practice something, depends on the ... sangha is. Because if you depend on the sangha, very naturally there are complications there. Complications in relation to the people who practice together in sangha. Very naturally, struggle there in the relationship among the people. So very naturally you don’t want to belong to the communities. So finally what do you want to do? You want to try to keep away that complication and trouble, and then just practice zazen. It seems to be fine, if you can. But it’s pretty difficult to do that. Because humans beings are too weak to preserve such a simple, strong, brave practice by yourself. Too weak. So very naturally, we have to have to practice together, helping each other.

So very naturally, this organization, community comes up. But this is culture, one of the cultures. So this is important, but if you have a culture called sangha, sangha practice, then very naturally you can see something missing. You don’t want to do. 

The same applies to the development of Buddhism in history. During the Song and Tang dynasties, Zen Buddhism was really flourishing in those days. Very naturally, five schools of Zen Buddhism there. But finally, it caused people to be confused. It’s very difficult to find the real essence of Buddhism. That’s why Tozan Zen Master tried to emphasize what is the real essence of Buddhist practice, Buddhist spirit. 

The same applies to Buddhism in the United States. There are many Buddhisms here. But from now on – well, you should study many kinds of schools; that’s alright. But the important point is, through the teaching of those denominations, you have to find individually what is the real essence of Buddhist teaching, beyond Tibetan Buddhism, Japanese Buddhism, Chinese Buddhism. [Beyond] American Buddhism, too! Don’t see Buddhism in terms of the American sense. You must be a person, beyond human cultural background. If you see Buddhism in terms of a certain human cultural background, it is already limited. But in that limitation of Buddhism, we cannot develop Buddhism, that’s why we have to think Buddhism in terms of American sense, but simultaneously it’s not *all* we have to do. Still continually we have to see the real essence of Buddhism, beyond that American effort toward Buddhism. 

So that’s why Tozan Zen Master tried to unify – unify means discover what is the essence of the Buddhist spirit, beyond denominations. 

So this is the Five Ranks of Zen Buddhism. And also in history, the teaching of the Five Ranks was described philosophically. It’s a really huge explanation. But here, at page 307, this is a very simple explanation in verse, gatha. A poetic explanation, appealing to human feeling, human emotion, instead of appealing to human intellect, philosophically or psychologically. So this is a very simple explanation.

First, let me read. Or Chris, will you read?

*(Chris reads:)*

> Thus it is said:
> 
>> The biased within the correct:  
>> In the middle of the first night, before the moon shines,  
>> No wonder, when they meet, they don’t recognize each other:  
>> Each is hidden, still embracing the aversion of former days.  
>>
>> The correct within the biased:  
>> At dawn an old woman encounters an ancient mirror;  
>> Clearly she sees her face—there is no other reality.  
>> Don’t go on mistaking the image for the head.  
>>
>> Coming from within the correct:  
>> Within nothingness there’s a road out of the dust.  
>> If you can just avoid violating the present taboo name,  
>> You’ll still surpass the eloquent ones of former dynasties who silenced every tongue.  
>>
>> Arrival within the biased:  
>> When two swords cross points, there’s no need to withdraw.  
>> A good hand is like a lotus in fire—  
>> Clearly he naturally has the energy to reach the heavens.
>> 
>> Arrival within both at once:  
>> He does not fall into being or non-being—who dares to associate with him?  
>> Everyone wants to get out of the ordinary flow,  
>> But after all he returns and sits in the ashes.  
>
> ( From *The Blue Cliff Record*, translated by Thomas Cleary & J.C. Cleary)

**Katagiri**: Okay, thank you. 

#### 24:05

So the first one is *the biased within the correct*. The second: *the correct within the biased*. The third: *coming from within the correct*. The fourth: *arrival within the biased*. Fifth: *arrival within both at once*.

The first two are the philosophical aspects of explaining the Five Ranks of Zen Buddhist teaching. 

The next two things are the teaching of the Five Ranks which are really alive in individual life, in a person’s life.

And the fifth is what is the real original spirit of Buddhism. What is that, which is pure? Purity means a state of being which is continually alive, boundlessly, under all circumstances. Wherever you may go, whatever you may do, under all circumstances, your life is really continually going, boundlessly. [This is] called liberation, freedom. So what is the meaning of freedom, liberation? Liberation or freedom is the real, original spirit of Buddhism; what is this? Is this a teaching? Or is this a matter of discussion? Is this something you can see, through the six consciousnesses? Or is this something [where] you should completely ignore the function of your six consciousnesses? Whatever you say, it doesn’t hit the real mark, what liberation or freedom is in your daily living. So that is the fifth thing. 

So the first two, those are the philosophical explanation. The philosophical explanation here doesn’t mean a certain [...] in terms of philosophical sense, only open to Buddhist teaching. It’s not a philosophical explanation here. Philosophical explanation of the Five Ranks means natural principle, open to [all] human beings, all sentient beings – how they exist. So in terms of Christianity, in terms of any kind of religion, they have their own terms or particular ideas; but if you take off those clothes, or cultural background, and then you become a person or human just as well as existence of trees, birds, snow – what is original principle of existence? This is natural law, which is never limited by any dogmatic teaching. So [that’s how] you should see the first two points.

#### 29:03

*The biased within the correct*. Let’s look at the note. (Note A)

> ‘Correct’ symbolizes emptiness, nirvana; ‘biased’ symbolizes matter-energy, samsara. The intrinsic identity of emptiness and matter-energy, nirvana and samsara, and hence the complementary unity of wisdom and compassion, is basic to Mahayana, or Great Vehicle Buddhism.

So biased means relative, the phenomenal world. The correct means the absolute.
