Today I would like to explain the Five Ranks of Soto Zen teaching. This is a kind of philosophical background, or Soto Zen teaching. Let’s look at page 307. 

Maybe the periods of development of Chinese Buddhism could be divided into three. Maybe first the first period of development of Chinese Buddhism was between the first century to the fifth century, during which the Buddhist texts were translated. That is the period of translating the Buddhist textbooks. And the second period is maybe the sixth century to the tenth century, during which the teaching of Buddhism in China, after translating the texts, was established, systematized. That is Chinese Buddhism: Tendai, and Avatamsaka School, and also also school means Buddhist psychology. And also Nirvana school, and also the [...] school; several schools were established in those days. And the third period is from the seventh century to the thirteenth century. Song and Tang dynasties.

During the first two periods, it was very difficult for the Chinese to experience directly the spirit of Buddhism, because during the first period of developing Buddhism, they really concentrated to translate Buddhist texts. And during the second period, they tried to systematize all the teachings of the Buddhist texts after translating them. So the philosophical system of Buddhism was already established, but still there was a lack of experiencing directly the spirit of Buddha’s teaching. And during the seventh century and eleventh century, the Song and Tang dynasties, Zen Buddhism was flourishing in those days, in order to experience the spirit of Buddhism directly. And then, very naturally, in the history of China, the five schools of Zen are found. 

But unfortunately, the more Zen Buddhism was flourishing, the more there were various understandings of the spirit of Zen Buddhism. So that’s why many schools were established. And then very naturally among those many schools, we are very confused, what is the essence of Zen Buddhism? Because it was too popularized, through various schools of Zen Buddhism. Look at the Japanese Buddhism: there are various schools in Japan, Zen schools, Tendai schools, Avasanga schools, and [...] schools, Shingon schools, tantric schools, et cetera. That means that how popular Buddhism has been among the people. The more Buddhism is popularized, the more there are some lack of developing the spirit of Buddhism, and also misunderstanding the spirit of Zen Buddhism. 

Do you understand? If something is very popularized, you have to explain using plain words, in order to appeal to people. So very naturally, Buddhism is gradually getting popularized, but on the other hand, you can easily lose the spirit of Buddhism. So I don’t know what is good; should you popularize Buddhism in the modern age, or should you preserve the original spirit of Zen Buddhism instead of trying to popularize Buddhism among modern people. I don’t know what is better, which is good, which is bad. But we cannot escape from both. You have to not popularize, you have to teach Buddhism to the people. On the other hand, when you try to teach Buddhism, you individually try to focus on preserving the original spirit of Buddhism. That is very important for us. But when Buddhism is very popular, famous, the people are really infatuated with it, because people believe that which is popularized is real Buddhism. I don’t think so; you have to be a little bit careful. Do you understand what I mean? 

So, Tozan Zen Master, who lived almost 9th century, he was born 8th or 7th century A.D., he tried to restore the original spirit of Buddhism. That is one reason why he established this teaching of the Five Ranks of Zen Buddhism. The second purpose is that he tried to unify the teaching of all five Zen Schools. In other words, beyond the teaching of the five schools of those days, what is the real essence of teaching, the spirit of Buddhism talked about by Buddha? Not teaching in terms of the teaching of each school. What is the real, original spirit of Buddhism, beyond the idea of denominations.

The same applies to Buddhism here in our days. Of course, in the beginning maybe Chinese Buddhism comes to America, and Japanese Buddhism comes to America, various Indian religions and philosophies comes to the United States. Tibetan Buddhism comes. But look at those Buddhisms. You’re really confused. What is the real Buddhism? If you try to learn Japanese Buddhism, you don’t like it, because it’s very stinky. And if you try to learn Chinese Buddhism, or Tibetan, or Indian, you cannot be satisfied completely. Because there are so many schools there, so very naturally you start looking around. That means you start to compare the Buddhism you have learned with others. Then you start to grope for the best Buddhism for you. But you never find it. So finally, just confusion is left. 

So I always tell you, the Buddhism you study is best. You don’t believe this, but for instance, the zazen you do. There are a hundred kinds of zazen, meditation, in this world. East Asian meditations, Western meditations, Catholic, Protestant... many kinds of meditation there, more than one hundred. And then among them you try to find the best meditation you want to do. No way to find the best one, because there are too many things. So finally you have to return to only one. That one is the meditation you are just devoting yourself into. That’s all. 

Gassho: If you study the ... mudra, it explains many kinds of gasshos. And also if you study the gassho under certain teachers, always every teacher gives you a different idea of type of gassho. What is ... gassho? 

So, very naturally, anything, not only Buddhism but whatever it is, if something is popularized, you can find something missing there. On the other hand, you cannot always preserve the original spirit of Buddhism or whatever, philosophy, without teaching, without opening it to the people. So there is some contradictory feeling there when you try. But we should be careful, anyway. 

So that’s why individually you really want to practice what? You really want to practice just simple practice, so-called zazen. Don’t you think so? Accepting the shifting complication of human life. Teaching and ceremony and philosophy, psychology, etc., anyway you just want a simple practice. So what you want to practice Buddhism is mainly not belong to the community, so-called Sangha, and practice something, depends on the ... sangha is. Because if you depend on the sangha, very naturally there are complications there. Complications in relation to the people who practice together in sangha. Very naturally, struggle there in the relationship among the people. So very naturally you don’t want to belong to the communities. So finally what do you want to do? You want to try to keep away that complication and trouble, and then just practice zazen. It seems to be fine, if you can. But it’s pretty difficult to do that. Because humans beings are too weak to preserve such a simple, strong, brave practice by yourself. Too weak. So very naturally, we have to have to practice together, helping each other.

So very naturally, this organization, community comes up. But this is culture, one of the cultures. So this is important, but if you have a culture called sangha, sangha practice, then very naturally you can see something missing. You don’t want to do. 

The same applies to the development of Buddhism in history. During the Song and Tang dynasties, Zen Buddhism was really flourishing in those days. Very naturally, five schools of Zen Buddhism there. But finally, it caused people to be confused. It’s very difficult to find the real essence of Buddhism. That’s why Tozan Zen Master tried to emphasize what is the real essence of Buddhist practice, Buddhist spirit. 

The same applies to Buddhism in the United States. There are many Buddhisms here. But from now on – well, you should study many kinds of schools; that’s alright. But the important point is, through the teaching of those denominations, you have to find individually what is the real essence of Buddhist teaching, beyond Tibetan Buddhism, Japanese Buddhism, Chinese Buddhism. [Beyond] American Buddhism, too! Don’t see Buddhism in terms of the American sense. You must be a person, beyond human cultural background. If you see Buddhism in terms of a certain human cultural background, it is already limited. But in that limitation of Buddhism, we cannot develop Buddhism, that’s why we have to think Buddhism in terms of American sense, but simultaneously it’s not *all* we have to do. Still continually we have to see the real essence of Buddhism, beyond that American effort toward Buddhism. 

So that’s why Tozan Zen Master tried to unify – unify means discover what is the essence of the Buddhist spirit, beyond denominations. 

So this is the Five Ranks of Zen Buddhism. And also in history, the teaching of the Five Ranks was described philosophically. It’s a really huge explanation. But here, at page 307, this is a very simple explanation in verse, gatha. A poetic explanation, appealing to human feeling, human emotion, instead of appealing to human intellect, philosophically or psychologically. So this is a very simple explanation.

First, let me read. Or Chris, will you read?

*(Chris reads:)*

> Thus it is said:

>> Clearly she sees her face—there is no other reality.  
>> Don’t go on mistaking the image for the head.

>> Coming from within the correct:  
>> Within nothingness there’s a road out of the dust.  
>> If you can just avoid violating the present taboo name,  
>> You’ll still surpass the eloquent ones of former dynasties who silenced every tongue.  
>>
>> Arrival within the biased:  
>> When two swords cross points, there’s no need to withdraw.  
>> A good hand is like a lotus in fire—  
>> Clearly he naturally has the energy to reach the heavens.
>> 
>> Arrival within both at once:  
>> He does not fall into being or non-being—who dares to associate with him?  
>> Everyone wants to get out of the ordinary flow,  
>> But after all he returns and sits in the ashes.

**Katagiri**: Okay, thank you. 

#### 24:05

So the first one is *the biased within the correct*. The second: *the correct within the biased*. The third: *coming from within the correct*. The fourth: *arrival within the biased*. Fifth: *arrival within both at once*.

The first two are the philosophical aspects of explaining the Five Ranks of Zen Buddhist teaching. 

The next two things are the teaching of the Five Ranks which are really alive in individual life, in a person’s life.

And the fifth is what is the real original spirit of Buddhism. What is that, which is pure? Purity means a state of being which is continually alive, boundlessly, under all circumstances. Wherever you may go, whatever you may do, under all circumstances, your life is really continually going, boundlessly. [This is] called liberation, freedom. So what is the meaning of freedom, liberation? Liberation or freedom is the real, original spirit of Buddhism; what is this? Is this a teaching? Or is this a matter of discussion? Is this something you can see, through the six consciousnesses? Or is this something [where] you should completely ignore the function of your six consciousnesses? Whatever you say, it doesn’t hit the real mark, what liberation or freedom is in your daily living. So that is the fifth thing. 

So the first two, those are the philosophical explanation. The philosophical explanation here doesn’t mean a certain [...] in terms of philosophical sense, only open to Buddhist teaching. It’s not a philosophical explanation here. Philosophical explanation of the Five Ranks means natural principle, open to [all] human beings, all sentient beings – how they exist. So in terms of Christianity, in terms of any kind of religion, they have their own terms or particular ideas; but if you take off those clothes, or cultural background, and then you become a person or human just as well as existence of trees, birds, snow – what is original principle of existence? This is natural law, which is never limited by any dogmatic teaching. So [that’s how] you should see the first two points.

#### 29:03

*The biased within the correct*. Let’s look at the note (Note A):

> ‘Correct’ symbolizes emptiness, nirvana; ‘biased’ symbolizes matter-energy, samsara. The intrinsic identity of emptiness and matter-energy, nirvana and samsara, and hence the complementary unity of wisdom and compassion, is basic to Mahayana, or Great Vehicle Buddhism.

So *biased* means relative, the phenomenal world. *The correct* means the absolute. The simple explanation of the five lines can be found in the book *Zen Dust*. Look at “The Koan of Five Lines” in *Zen Dust*, explained by Isshū Miura and Ruth Fuller Sasaki.

First, *the biased within the correct*:

>> In the middle of the first night, before the moon shines, ...

That means complete darkness. But in darkness, many things exist. The problem is that your consciousness cannot reach [them], that’s all. But regardless of whether your consciousness can reach or not, there are many beings existing in the realm of darkness.

>> No wonder, when they meet, they don’t recognize each other: ...

We cannot see them, but they exist. And also they meet each other but they don’t recognize each other.

>> Each is hidden, still embracing the aversion of former days.  

“Each is hidden” means ... there is something unclear, uncertain. There is something, even though it is very dim, unclear, uncertain. That is the meaning of “each is hidden”. 

“Embracing the aversion” means something beautiful which is inviolable. “Embracing aversion” means total beauty, perfect beauty, including aversion, suffering, pleasure, good and bad – all things. Embracing aversion is including all. Aversion and pleasure and peace are interconnected with each other, and then that is total perfect beauty.

“Of former days” means there is something, but it is unclear, pretty dim, pretty uncertain. But it is something beautiful you cannot explain. 

In the *Lotus Sutra* Chapter Four, you can see the parable of the poor son. Do you remember? The poor son used to be the son of a very noble, rich family. But unfortunately he started to wander all over the country, for fifty years. Some day he came to his father’s home by chance, and his father found him [...], his son. But the son doesn’t recognize him as his father. So the father tried to get him to stay in his home, but he ran away. So the father sent one of his servants to ask him to work at his father’s home as a janitor, cleaning the toilets, clearning the house, et cetera, anyway that what was a very low-level job. So he started to work, but still he didn’t recognize that he was his father. So again and again his father tried to let him recognize that house or that property or that treasure belonged to him, but it took a really long time. But finally he realized. The house was his house, the father was his father. So that means the son wandering for fifty years as a beggar, seems to be very poor, dirty. Wearing dirty rags. But never the less, there was really something beautiful which was indescribable. That means he used to be son of a noble, rich family. That means you are buddha. You are greatness of existence.

This is not a particular son of a noble rich family. If I explain this [story] philosophically, you say “that is a philosophical explanation, which seems to be extra,” but it’s not, because it’s always illuminating in your life. But your consciousness, your knowledge, your senses cannot see it, that’s all. But if someone who really realized that point sees very easily that beautiful which is indescribable. 

*[Tape change.]*

... We are Buddha. Not we have Buddahood; we *are* Buddha. But even though apparently you are poor, wearing dirty rags, or you have a miserable life, or you are not sharp, not bright – but nevertheless, right in the middle of this poor, miserable life still there is something beautiful which you cannot ignore.

This is natural law. Everyone possesses. Natural law is not something you should try to understand, analyzing and synthesizing. Of course Buddhism explains this philosophically, if you want to do that. But after studying, first of all you have to participate in this natural law. That means totally accept this. 

Totally accept means in your daily life totally accept the natural law, you are Buddha. You are beings illuminating something beautiful which no one ignores. That means under all circumstances we have to look continually look at human existence with a very profound glance. Seeing deeply into the original picture of existence. That’s all we have to do, first. Even though you don’t understand, you should accept anyway. That means, listen to this with your heart. Listening to that rhythm of natural law by your intellectual sense is something coming *after* you really accept, you really listening to the rhythm of natural law with your heart. 

With your heart means, later I will tell you, that practically, you must be patient. Continually. You don’t understand natural law, because you have never experienced it, but you are right there. If you are right there, all you have to do is just continue to live there. You should live with your total heart. If you try to live with your intellectual sense, with your six consciousnesses, it’s very hard. But that is something coming after total acceptance of your existence with your heart. And then, intellectual understanding comes, step by step. 

That’s why Tozan Zen Master says “In the middle of the first night, before the moon shines.” Everything exists, everyone exists, all sentient beings exist, totally in equality in the realm of darkness. You never see them through your intellectual sense. That is darkness. But we meet each other. We meet each other but we don’t recognize it. We meet this rhythm of natural law, but we don’t recognize it. That’s all. 

So what should we do? “Each is hidden, still embracing the aversion of former days.” That is what? That is we should believe there is something which is very dim, very unclear, but it is something beautiful which you cannot ignore. Just like a dim image of a mother for the baby. Hold it by her arm. The mother’s face is exactly dim, unclear, for the baby. Just like in the darkness. A dim image of the mother’s face comes out, illuminated by the light of a candle, in the darkness. Just like that. Just before you become completely blind, you can see a little bit, but you cannot see exactly. So the image of the mother for the baby is just like this, because the baby’s consciousness doesn’t work exactly. It’s very dim and unclear, but it’s really [there]. Baby is completely filled there in the realm of dim image of mother’s life. Baby’s life is exactly alive. It’s not a matter of discussion. All baby has to do is just stand up there and depend on it, totally accept. That is natural law. 

So philosophically or intellectually, if you want to understand natural law philosophically or psychologically, first of all, your life must be firm, standing straight, in the realm of Buddha’s world. That means looking at the total picture of existence with a profound glance. Continually. That is just to stand up. When you do zazen, completely beyond useful practice or useless practice, completely beyond when you want to do zazen, just be present there. Firmly. At that time, probably you can a dim image of zazen’s face, appearing in the darkness. But it’s pretty good. If you see it, that’s pretty nice. 

So that is the first line, *the biased within the correct*. It means the relative within the absolute. The absolute means vast expanse of horse pastures, which is called truth. All sentient beings exist there, completely beyond your speculation.

#### 48:27

The second: *the correct within the biased*.

The absolute is not something separate from the relative. The absolute is exactly right in the middle of the relative. For this, it says:

>> At dawn an old woman encounters an ancient mirror;  ...

“At dawn”: that is space. There are discriminated entities in the spatial dimensions. That is at dawn.

“An old woman” [represents] the many entities which exist in the time process. 

“Encounters and ancient mirror”: ancient mirror means the truth, the absolute. Ancient does not mean old; ancient means completely beyond old and new. That means truth. 

So at dawn, all sentient beings in the realm of space, in the realm of time, encounter in the realm of the absolute. That means regardless of whether you understand or not, we are constantly encountering there, reflected in the ancient mirror, the absolute. 

So for this, practically, what should we do? Very naturally, according to the first line, you have to stand up straight; this is the first attitude. Constantly. Believe or not, stand up straight, every day. Secondly, try to research, try to learn human existence until you can touch the bottom of the river. That’s pretty hard. But that is continuous effort. If you stand up there, you cannot take a nap in the realm of standing straight. You have to stand up there in the realm of natural law, and next you have to make continuous effort, until you can reach the bottom of the river. That is the second. 

So “at dawn an old woman encounters an ancient mirror” – at that time you can really reach the bottom of the river. At that time,

>> Clearly she sees her face—there is no other reality.  

Exactly you can see your own face. But this face is not an old face or miserable face or beautiful face. No. It’s not. If your face is reflected in the mirror, the absolute, by reaching the bottom of the river, at that time there is no other reality. Exactly you are one with the bottom of the river. 

>> Don’t go on mistaking the image for the head.
