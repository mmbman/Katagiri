Toward the end of [Fukanzazengi](glossary#fukanzazengi), as a conclusion, [Dogen Zenji](glossary#dogen) explains how important [shikantaza](glossary#shikantaza) is from a different angle, from [a] various way. So, little by little, we try to learn. 

> In surveying the past, we find that transcendence of both unenlightenment and [enlightenment](glossary#enlightenment), and dying while either [sitting](glossary#sitting) or standing, have all depended entirely on the strength of [zazen](glossary#zazen)." 

*[he repeats the quote]*

The notes given by Professor Abe ([Masao Abe](glossary#masao-abe)) say about dying while either sitting or standing: "It is written in *[unintelligible]* [Denkoroku](glossary#denkoroku) that [Bodhidharma](glossary#bodhidharma) and the fourth, fifth and sixth Chinese Zen [patriarchs](glossary#ancestor) died sitting in [zazen](glossary#zazen), while the third patriarch died while standing under a large tree. Examples of both are common in the [Zen](glossary#zen) histories." So from this point, some Zen teachers kept sitting and died. Some teachers died in sitting zazen, or standing under [a] tree, or standing on the platform while he's giving a lecture. Anyway, there are examples in Buddhist history, but it doesn't mean you should die in sitting or standing; it doesn't mean that. The point is how important shikantaza is, because they died in sitting, in standing. Wherever they may be, they died in peace and harmony. Whatever they do, wherever they are, they died.

So, [Dogen Zenji](glossary#dogen) really wants to [speak] about how important [zazen](glossary#zazen) is. That zazen is [shikantaza](glossary#shikantaza). In shikantaza, all delusions drop off from the first. That is dropping off body and mind; body and mind dropping off. That is zazen itself. 

##### 4:37

Usually in the world, we constantly persist in our selfishness, [ego consciousness](glossary#ego-consciousness), in order to accomplish our own purpose in life. Kicking out everybody; adhering to our egoistic sense. And finally, [we] may be disinterested in human life. There are some who commit suicide on the verge of life and death, because they are disinterested in human life after persisting in their own selfishness. Because, no one pays attention to you if you do that. Finally, those kind of people are completely isolated. And also, you cannot do anything in peace and harmony, you cannot live with the people in the human world in peace and harmony; so finally, it is really true that you are disinterested in human life. 

So, on the verge of life and death, there are some who commit suicide, kill themselves. Even though they can keep their life longer, they take their life.

##### 6:56

There are some that, the death compels them to die even though they don't want to die. There are some that scream right before their death, because they don't like [it]. I know lots of examples. 

I took care of a young man who served [in the] army. At that time he was 30 years old. But at his house, for many, many years, he persisted, he really adhered to his egoistic sense, and he did as he liked. Whatever happened, [he was] kicking out everybody. He did everything that he liked. Finally, there was nothing to do which caused him to be interested.... So he was disinterested in [his] usual daily life. So, he went and entered [the] army. 

Well, he found [it] a little bit interesting, a little bit fun there, because there are lots of chances to kill a person, and animals, and using guns; and lots of fun there which he had never experienced before, so he enjoyed [it] very much. But unfortunately, one day he fell down from a tree while he was trimming the tree with a Japanese hand saw. He fell down from the high tree. And finally, the bottom of his body [was] completely numb. He couldn't walk. So, he was in the army hospital.

But he was pretty young, 30 years old, so he had lots of energy. Still, he couldn't awaken to himself. Still he expressed his ego in order to accomplish his purpose of his life. Screaming at the nurses, and hitting somebody, and fighting, even though he sat down on the chair. You know ... using the special chair? He screams at the nurses, and [is] fighting the nurses and doctors. Whenever I visited there, I always made every possible effort to make him calm. "Keep your mouth shut. Sit down here. Eat breakfast. Eat lunch," I always told him. But he enjoyed [it] very much. It was a part of his life. 

And then [in] three years, he got another disease... maybe a kidney didn't work. If a kidney didn't work, well, the poisons ... go around his whole body. He couldn't have urine, so all of a sudden, the poisons went around his body. Three days after starting to suffer from this, he died.

But right before he died, he really screamed. He really screamed, with a big voice. No one knew what to do, because there is death. He screamed.

And then, when I visited there, he immediately grabbed me, held me here, and he said, "I don't want to die!"

It was his last scene. At the conclusion, he had for so long persisted in his egoistic sense, in order to see his purpose, the purpose of his life. That was concluded.

This is very common. Very common.

##### 13:43

So, for such people, they never thought [of the] significance of [zazen](glossary#zazen), which causes all delusions to drop off from the first. They never thought [of] even glancing once at such a wonderful world. They don't care. That is okay. 

But it is not bad to glance at that wonderful world. Even once in your whole life; that's great. It's not bad. Even [if] you cannot have a chance to glance at this wonderful world even once in your whole life, [still] if you want to pursue this, it's not bad for us. Because life is going on. So life after life, we can do it. 

##### 15:14

There is a [Zen](glossary#zen) story in [The Blue Cliff Record](BCR), the [46th case](BCR#case-46), this is a very famous Zen [koan](glossary#koan): 

> “[Kyosei](glossary#kyosei) [Zen Master](glossary#zen-master) asked a monk, “What sound is that outside the gate?” 
> 
> The monk said, “The sound of raindrops.”
> 
> Kyosei said, “Sentient beings are inverted. They lose themselves and follow after things.”
> 
> The monk said, “What about you, Teacher?”
> 
> Kyosei said, “I almost don’t lose myself.”
> 
> The monk said, “What is the meaning of ‘I almost don’t lose myself’?”
> 
> Kyosei said, “Though it should be easy to come out of freedom and say something about it, to merge oneself in freedom and say something about it has to be difficult.”

##### 16:46

What [Kyosei](glossary#kyosei) asked the monk – his ... question is something [with] which Kyosei [Zen Master](glossary#zen-master) raked [the] monk's mind [to see] how much his practice was going on. So, "What sound is that outside the gate?" The monk said, "The sound of raindrops." But, [the] teacher didn't ask [for the] sound of the raindrop[s]; he asked [for the] raindrop[s] themselves.

But he used the words, "What's the sound outside of the gate?" So, the monk said, "That is [the] sound of raindrops." You know the sound. [The] sound is not [the] raindrops. Raindrops are raindrops. But [the] sound comes from where? Raindrops. But [the] sound is not raindrops. It's very clear, don't you think so? Because raindrops are, anyway, *raindrops*. ... Raindrops are active, moving, very active. Becoming one, or from [the] merging of raindrops and Earth and Universe – at that time, this is raindrops. Before you hear the sound of raindrops, that is raindrops. But you say, "some raindrops." That is already something *extra*, don't you think so? 

##### 19:02

You hear the sound. How long does it take to hear the sound from the raindrop? It takes time. Even the sound of a jet airplane. Can you hear the sound? I always hear the sound of a jet airplane, and then maybe I realize, "Oh, airplane up there, right above my head," because the sound of the jet airplane comes right above my head. So I look up – but there is no airplane. Airplane is far from me, already. Do you experience this? How long does it take, to hear the sound? That is the sound. 

And then we say, "Oh, that is a jet airplane." I don't think so. The real jet airplane has gone already. 

##### 20:33

So, the [Zen Master](glossary#zen-master) asked, "What sound is that outside the gate?" The monk said, "sound of the raindrops." This is a very straightforward, honest monk. We do [this] always. Maybe I [would] say [it] in [the] same way: "Yes, rain. Sound of raindrops." 

And then the [Zen Master](glossary#zen-master) points out: well, pay attention. That [previous answer] is okay, because without this experience you cannot understand real rain drops. So that's alright; but pay more careful attention to [the] sound of [the] raindrops again. That's why [the] Zen teacher says, "sentient beings are inverted."

##### 21:32

Yes, we are inverted. This is spiritual, don't you think so? You're sitting here; how much can you sit? What is the sound of your [shikantaza](glossary#shikantaza)? You say, "Yes, sound; that is a sound." What is the sound in you? You say, "sound of shikantaza," but it's too late, because real shikantaza has gone already. And then you catch the sound from the shikantaza, and when you grasp it: "that is shikantaza." It's not shikantaza – you are already inverted. Don't you think so? 

And then you judge immediately, and then finally, you follow after that again and again. What happens after that, after following after things? After things means, sound. You know that [Dogen Zenji](glossary#dogen) says, I told you often, the moment consists of 60 instants. (Katagiri says "instances," but he probably means "instants"; that is probably the better translation.) So what you can hear, the moment, is sound of the moment. *[he snaps his fingers]* Like this. But, this one moment *[finger snap]* consists of 60 instants. If it is true – what did you hear? What in the moment have you heard? *[snap]* This sound, don't you think so? But this sound, the moment, is nothing but sort of dregs after you squeeze the 60 instants. And then you got the one grip of the raindrops, just the raindrops: "I've got it." But that is one moment – already, 60 instants you have missed! So how can you know? 

##### 24:05

The same applies to this monk's answer. That's why the [Zen Master](glossary#zen-master) says, "Sentient beings are inverted. They lose themselves and follow after things." At that time, you completely lose sight of yourself, because you follow after things, after the sound of the raindrops. Believing, "That is raindrops." If I say, "No, it's not raindrops," you continually persist: "It's rain drops!" So finally, we fight each-other. But that means you lose sight of yourself. 

##### 25:12

The monk ... didn't understand, that's why the monk asked, "What about you? How do you understand that?" And then the [Zen Master](glossary#zen-master) says, "I almost don't lose myself." That's pretty good. *[he chuckles]* Because, without some raindrop you [can] listen to, you cannot understand the raindrop, what it is. [So] how can you reach raindrop as it really is? No way. Because, it's huge. Before you perceive, before you hear the sound, that is [the] real raindrop. How can you realize [this]? It's not [a] dream, it's real rain – but how can you reach there? Through only one thing, [only] one way you can reach [it]: through the sound of the raindrop.

But, you shouldn't lose sight of yourself, and also you shouldn't follow after that sound of raindrops. Well, move away! Move away. We always sit on the chair of the sound of the raindrop, insisting that is the raindrop. But it's not the raindrop. 

##### 26:59

So, he doesn't stay there. He knows the sound of the raindrop but it is not the raindrop. So he knows pretty well; that's why he doesn't stay there. If he doesn't stay with the sound of the raindrop, he doesn't lose himself. But without [the] sound of the raindrop, he cannot understand the raindrops as they are; that's why he loses sight of himself. Do you understand? That's why his activity, his relationship between the raindrop and his life, is always moving dynamically.

So he said, "almost". "I almost don't lose myself." "Almost" means constantly he is free, between raindrops and his life. If you stay even for a moment, you lose. If you ignore the sound of raindrops, you burn out – you lose. If you completely keep away from sound of the drop, your life is frozen; it doesn't work. And then, if you attach to the sound of raindrops, your life burns up. What should you do? No answer. It really depends on you. But this is true.

##### 29:06

The same applies to death. If you attach to the death, if you sit down in the chair of the death, that death is something extra coming upside. It really scares you. So at that time, you really burn up. So we don't like it. We say, "I hate death." But if you completely keep away from death, you forfeit. Your life doesn't work. 

So you can live full on, just imagine. If you could live full on, like a heavenly being, finally you could be disinterested in humans, because no fun. Because, fun is always there. Fun is always, constantly there. [There is] no need of trying to get the desires to get fun; fun is always there. So finally, no fun. You are disinterested in fun. Do you understand?

##### 30:47

Well, it is really true. You are supported by air, hydrology ... carbonic acid gas, and also oxygen. Your life is supported constantly. And you are disinterested in it; you don't pay careful attention to it – because you are always basking in it. 

Only [when] something happens which is called [a] gap or crack, you are really confused. Only when the continuity is broken up, there is a gap, so you are very confused. But between the air and you, [things] are communicating very smoothly day after day – [so there is] no interest there; you are disinterested in [that]. Or you have no idea which you are interested in or are disinterested in; completely going on. 

##### 32:16

So the monk asks, "What is the meaning of, 'I almost don't lose myself?'" The [Zen Master](glossary#zen-master) says, "Though it still should be easy to come out of freedom and say something about it..." If you get freedom, if you understand [the] real meaning of raindrops. Because, [the] Zen Master says, you listen to [and] you can hear the sound of raindrops, you believe that is *raindrops*. But Zen teacher says it is not raindrops; you believe the *sound* of the raindrops. And then, you understand: "Really? Oh, what are *real* raindrops?" That is a kind of [enlightenment](glossary#enlightenment). 

So, you can express [that]. If you come out of the understanding of raindrops, which is called [enlightenment](glossary#enlightenment) or freedom, then [you] can express [it]. But it's not so easy. It's not so easy to say something about freedom itself, raindrops themselves. When you are one with it: no, nothing to say. It's pretty hard. 

For instance, you and your air are communicating smoothly, working in themselves very smoothly – how can you say [it]? How can you think of the situation? No explanation. But if you come out of this situation and look at the air, and look at you, and look at the very smooth functioning of your internal organs – well, we say, "Oh, air! I am basking in [the] merit of air, constantly." You say so – but it is still [an] explanation. 

##### 35:06

[The] same applies to [shikantaza](glossary#shikantaza). Shikantaza is just shikantaza. When you merge yourself in [zazen](glossary#zazen) itself, very naturally, all [dualisms](glossary#dualism) drop off. All verbal explanations drop off. Nothing to say. Sound of raindrops or real raindrops or not real raindrops – nothing to say. So, all you have to do is, just be one with shikantaza itself. At that time, very naturally, your body and mind are really basking in shikantaza, [and] shikantaza is basking in your body and mind; they don't bother each other. Just be there, constantly. 

But if you for a moment come out of this shikantaza, you can look at yourself and also many things around you and then immediately, [the] mind starts to attach. Making noise.

##### 37:05

That's why this morning I told you: cease fire. (This was during a seven-day sesshin. Katagiri may have offered some guidance during a [zazen](glossary#zazen) session or at another time.) Completely cease fire. Cease fire doesn't mean throw away. Nothing to do. It's not necessary to do anything particular; only to stop firing, stop shooting. Nothing to do. All you have to do is, here is [shikantaza](glossary#shikantaza). Shikantaza – well, arranging the circumstances, and regulating the body and breath, and also regulating mind, based on no [de]sign of becoming [Buddha](glossary#buddha), or whatever it is. Just sit down there.

And then finally, you can stop shooting. If you do it, you can stop shooting, very naturally. Stop shooting immediately, okay? On the other hand, stop shooting "catches" many things. Even a small sound, even the tiny sound of a needle falling onto the floor, you can catch it. So that is completely ceasing fire. Surroundings are perfectly calm; at that time, you can catch it – everything. But all you have to do [is], you shouldn't fire. After thinking "sound of raindrops," all you have to do is, just be one with the raindrops. 

##### 39:10

What are the raindrops? Raindrops are you. Raindrops are [zazen](glossary#zazen). If you create a gap between you and zazen, immediately you can catch the sound you create and raindrops create, and then follow after this sound, and believe, "that is raindrop," [or] "shikantaza." That is confusion. So completely cease firing. For this – no way, completely nothing to do. All you have to do is, there is one [thing], which is called shikataza – just do it. Just do, okay?

##### 40:16

I always tell the example [of] death because death is [a] very good example in order to explain [shikantaza](glossary#shikantaza), in which all delusions completely drop off. Right in the middle of death, all delusions drop off. You are qualified to accept death, or you are not qualified to accept death, or you are stupid, or you are not stupid – it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter; just death. Don't you think so? If you hear the sound from [zazen](glossary#zazen), from practicer, you say, "I am qualified to be a good Zen student," or, "I am not qualified," "I am stupid," "I am not stupid," "I am *[unintelligible]*". But whatever you say, it's really sounds. But right in the middle of shikantaza itself, it is really exactly [the] same as death itself. No way. Exactly no way. 

The gap is something which causes you to see something objectively. While [you are] seeing something objectively, it creates lots of things. Fear, enjoy[ment], criticism, judgement, good and bad; many things. But if you are one with exactly death itself, nothing to say. If you're one. 

##### 42:37

And then – well for instance, if I die. Before dying, I can see my death. It really scares me. "I don't want to die." Or I say, "Okay, okay; I can die." On the other hand, I don't want to die. But death is coming up to me. So, always I discuss with death: "I like it, but I don't *like* it." – "Well, are you sure you like death?" – "No, I don't. But anyway, no way, so I like it." – "But, it is not honest." So, if I continue to ask myself, "Are you sure?" – I don't like it. But if you don't like [it], can you escape from it? No way. Because death is just coming up to me. Death is there, coming up. 

But right before, until death reaches me, death is still not real death. [It is the] sound of death; I always hear the sound of death. Then after the sound of death, always it makes me confused. "I like it," "I don't like it," "I like it," "I don't like it"... "Oh, I don't care." Whatever you say, this is nothing but hearing the sound of death, that's all. It's not real death. But if the death reaches me perfectly – no death. No [suffering](glossary#suffering), no prison, no delusions. Completely all delusions drop off. 

And then immediately, there is a moment that comes up, which is called after death. And then [Katagiri](glossary#katagiri) says, "Oh. I died." But if I died... *[he laughs]* I cannot see died. But anyway, let's see the movie. So, I look at the death, and then lots of sounds come up, and then I say, criticizing: "Oh, I like it. Oh, poor Katagiri," patting my head. And also, fighting death, and sometimes shaking hands with death, and sometimes escaping from [death], sometimes playing hide and seek with death. But whatever happens, death is continually coming up to me; this is reality. This is very normal. 

##### 45:45

So finally, whatever I say, that is a [dualistic](glossary#dualistic) world. Lots of things come up. Stumbling over whatever I say, finally, what happens? All I have to do is to merge myself in death as it really is, because it's real. So, finally, death says, "Hi." If he says, "Hi," I can answer, "Hi" – because it's already one.

So, no delusions – what I have to say or shouldn't say. I should give answer to death, "Hi," or not – no delusions. Completely all delusions drop off, if I become one with death, exactly. And then, [the] movie [is] still going on. That is life.

*[tape change]*

... death, coming out of [enlightenment](glossary#enlightenment). So I can say, "Ah. That is death." But still, it's not real death. Do you understand? It's not real death.

##### 47:27

That's why [the] [Zen Master](glossary#zen-master) says, it's not so easy to say death itself, rain drops itself. While you merge yourself in themself – exactly there, you cannot say, you cannot say anything at all. 

But [the] mind is pretty picky. Mind is very picky, always picking up. That's why you don't know; you're confused. But death is [a] very good example, that's why I always use the example of death. 

##### 48:10

So recently we had tragic airplane accidents very often. I always think of the people who died, who are *dying* there. If I were them, I always think, what should I do? What's happened in my life? I can think of lots of things.

But whenever I get a solution through the [Zen](glossary#zen) stories, koans, or [shikantaza](glossary#shikantaza), dropping off body and mind – whatever you say, it's completely words. Don't you think so? If you face death, there is no time to discuss [it].

And then, *[unintelligible]* what you could do, right in the middle of that situation. *[there is a long pause]* No guarantee. No guarantee. "I should do this, or that," – No. I don't have anything to promise you. "I can die in peace and harmony right in the middle of such a situation" – I cannot say so. Or I cannot say, "I [would be] completely confused and scream" – I cannot say so. I don't know. Actually, I don't know what to do. 

##### 50:18

This is reality, okay? This is reality. So that's why we are practicing [shikantaza](glossary#shikantaza). If you use [Zazen](glossary#zazen) as a means, zazen doesn't work. [It] doesn't work right in the middle of the problem, right on the verge of life and death – it doesn't make sense. Don't you think so? 

For instance, "[Zazen](glossary#zazen) gives you lots of strength, so you should do zazen." So you are interested in such a zazen. "Through zazen lots of ways of regulating breath, and step by step, there are lots of techniques." So you follow these techniques, and you can completely take care of breath, perfectly. And then you say, "Oh, my zazen is perfect." And then, still you don't believe [it], so we try to buy the machine [for measuring] brain waves, and connect it, eh? *[there is some shuffling and chuckling]* Look at this through your brain. Let's start to do zazen: "How about breath, how about body?" *[sound of patting self]* – "Body is okay. Yes, okay." – "How about the breath; breath is okay?" – "Yes, okay." Well, even though you don't say [it], [the] machine says it's okay. 

So how about the brain and nerve system? So you connect [the machine], you plug me in, and [the] brain is constantly going. And then the machine says, "Oh, your brain is calm now." *[the group laughs]* So you say, "Wow! Wonderful! I [am] enlightened person." That's interesting. Don't you think so? That's great. So, finally, you cannot stop looking at the machine. *[laughter]* Finally, you try to collect the money to buy that machine. *[more laughter]* And connecting that machine, sitting [zazen](glossary#zazen) right in front of the machine. Without the machine you cannot do zazen, because [there is] nothing to prove your zazen as a means. So you continue to sit right in front of the machine. So, every day [you] sit; every day the machine says, "Your brain [is] good!" – "Good!" – "Good!" And then you say, "My zazen [is] perfect." And then psychologists [compile] the data and say: "Katagiri's zazen [is] perfect. This is what is called shikantaza: all delusions drop off." *[laughter]* I don't think so. *[everyone laughs]* And then, next moment, [the] psychologist says, "May I borrow your machine?" *[laughter]* And then, I cannot stop sitting, so without the machine, I have to do zazen. Well, what should I do? No clue! And then, immediately my mind is going on: "It's not perfect!" So, I cannot do zazen without [a] machine. Don't you think so? 

##### 54:16

Well, [zazen](glossary#zazen), [shikantaza](glossary#shikantaza), is completely nothing. Here is a good example in San Francisco. This man was a little bit *[unintelligible]*. Ten years ago, Japanese scholars were interested in checking the brain waves during zazen, so it influenced American scholars. So American scholars started to check [Zen](glossary#zen ) teachers and students, and so, I was one of the students, and he was interested in checking my brain. I didn't like it, but [Suzuki](glossary#suzuki-roshi) said, "Why don't you go there?" *[laughter]* But *he* didn't go! *[louder laughter]* He didn't go, but he asked me, "Why don't you go there," so I went. One gentleman was very interested in checking his brain, so he went to [the] hospital *every day*, because he was very interested. So every day he went there, and the psychology student really appreciated him because *[he laughs]* he completely offered his brain with his zazen. So he enjoyed [it] very much every day. He went, and checked, and checked, and finally there is data, [which] says: "Your zazen is perfect." 

Well, he couldn't stop. Still, he wanted to go there and check his brain. Because, he didn't have his life with confidence without [the] machine. So finally, he bought it. *[he laughs]* He bought the machine. Then he put the machine [on]; the machine is saying, "You're good. Now... Uh-oh, you aren't!" *[laughter]* *[unintelligible]* Anyway, very comic; it's very comic what occurs with the modern [Zen?]. Sitting in [zazen](glossary#zazen), in back of the screen, completely [a mess]. Even though zazen machine says, "Your brain is calm," – very neat – but behind the screen, completely a mess. Because he doesn't know what to do; without machine, mess appears in front. *[he laughs]* So he's confused.

##### 57:40

So if you use [zazen](glossary#zazen) like this, as a means like this, it doesn't make sense. Even though for three years you use zazen and get a strong feeling and spirit in your life – [still] it doesn't connect with the problem of life and death. No connection. So finally, forget it. All you have to do is, you have to be one with [shikantaza](glossary#shikantaza). That's all! Right now, right here, that's all you have to do. And then at that time, we can say, all delusions drop off. But that is [an] explanation, after. Raindrops touch the ground, make a sound, coming out of [enlightenment](glossary#enlightenment) – and then I can say, that is the sound of raindrops. But it's not real raindrops. We're always here, keeping our distance.

... [Dogen Zenji](glossary#dogen) says, "[Zazen](glossary#zazen) is dropping off body and mind." Remember this. Your whole life, you should remember [this]. "Zazen is dropping off body and mind" means all delusions drop off. That means exactly [the] same as death. Death is exactly [the] same as life. So how can I say [it]? How can I check? While all delusions drop off, right in the middle of death – nothing. Nothing to say. But, when you become one with death, all delusions drop off! Otherwise you cannot become one with death. Don't you think so? It is really true. Completely drop off.

##### 1:00:02

But we don't do that. Taking away all delusions, *and then* I want to be one – it's too late; you cannot do this. You have to be one anyway. If you're one, all delusions drop off very naturally. But we don't believe [it], because we get use of always keeping a certain distance and hearing the sound ... and believing that is [the] real world. And [we] continue to follow after that. That's why we are inverted. Perverted. 

(Katagiri may mean "we get used to" rather than "we get use of" above, but it's hard to be sure, and "we get use of" is such an interesting statement that I kept it intact.)

##### 1:00:57

If you look at the [Zen](glossary#zen) teachers in the United States, I don't believe there are any good Zen teachers. If you check all [the] Zen teachers, according to [Dogen](glosssary#dogen) and [Buddhas](glossary#buddha): no real Zen teachers. I'm sorry for you. No Zen teacher. Failure of Zen teachers, okay? Failure. 

But this is [an] explanation of Zen teacher, understanding of Zen teacher. Then if you say, "I am [a] failure of [a] Zen teacher" – why don't you give it away, and return to normal life? Of course, it's very reasonable. But I don't want [that] – even though you say, "I am [a] failure of [a] Zen teacher; I don't want to come back, I want to be dead." Because, we can do [shikantaza](glossary#shikantaza). Shikantaza is really compassion, really compassion. But, this is really strict. No way. All we have to do is, whatever people say – "You are failure of Zen teacher," or "You are great Zen teacher," – it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. All you have to do is listen to the sound of the raindrops. On the other hand, you cannot stay there. All you have to do is, you have to stand up there, stand up right in the middle of raindrops as they really are, where all delusions drop off. You are qualified or you are not qualified, it doesn't matter; anyway, you have to be there. That is real practice. You should do this. And then, you can create great teacher, I can create great teacher. This is important. 

So, if you don't like [this]: if you look at the United States, I promise, there is no good teacher. No good teacher. If some teacher believes, "I am [the] best" – well, that is fake. If some Zen teacher says, "I am fake, so I don't want to be [a] teacher" – this is also fake. Do you understand? *[someone laughs]* This is also fake. But whatever happens, all we have to do is, to be present right in the middle of death itself, life itself, where all delusions drop off. Qualified or not qualified, it doesn't matter. You cannot ignore [it]; you should accept [it]. But all we have to do is, just practice this. At that time, you can find great teacher, finally. Teacher finds great teacher. 

So, some teacher says, "I am not qualified to be [a] teacher," so he returns to normal life. But what he does – he does [the] same things as before. Don't you think so? Same things. I know several people [like this]. And also he makes [an] announcement in public: "I am no longer a priest." This is wonderful; but what he does is the same thing. 

##### 1:05:45

What would you like? There is stinky, muddy water, there is beautiful water – but both [are the] same. And you can do the same things, wherever you may be: [a] beautiful, nice place, nice smell, beautiful place, or here is a muddy, stinky [place], and lots of things. That is the samsaric world. And here is another beautiful world; but both [are the] same. And whatever you may be, you can do things. What would you like? What would you *be*? What would you *prefer* to be? Do you want be stinky, muddy *[unintelligible]*? Do you understand?

##### 1:06:50

If you are [in a] beautiful place, there's a lot of "barking." Remember this. Many people bark at you. Because you are already [in a] beautiful place, that's why you can see lots of ugly things. If you make a mistake, lots of things happen. And then immediately you [say], "That is something extra." If you do this, you never touch the core of human life. 

All are [Buddha](glossary#buddha). Muddy water, beautiful water: all Buddha. Whatever you may be, you can do same things; Buddha's world. Which would you like? It's very clear. No one prefers [a] dirty place. Don't you think so? [It's a] very simple practice. But if you are [in a] beautiful place, it's not so easy. It's not so easy. But we should accept [it]. 

And all we have to do is, whatever you may be, we can do [the] same thing. That same thing is [shikantaza](glossary#shikantaza). Shikantaza, where all delusions drop off from the first. It's not necessary [that] you should find some order, or demand, "Go away"; you cannot say so. If you say "go away," they don't go away. Even though you say "please stay," they don't stay.

##### 1:08:50

That's why [Dogen Zenji](glossary#dogen) says ... "We find that transcendence of both unenlightenment or [enlightenment](glossary#enlightenment)..." – that is good or bad, right, wrong, qualified or not qualified, whatever you say. "Transcend" – this is [shikantaza](glossary#shikantaza) itself... transcending of death and life. And then all you have to do is, be one with death when death comes. That is shikantaza. 

At that time, you can die while you're sitting, you can die while you're standing, very naturally. You can die lying down on your bed. You can die at home, *[unintelligible]*

"... have all depended entirely on the strength of [zazen](glossary#zazen)." This is zazen. Yes it is.
