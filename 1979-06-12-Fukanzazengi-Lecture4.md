Toward end of Fukanzazengi, as the conclusion, Dogen Zenji explains how important shikantaza is from a different angle, from various way. So ... we try to learn. "In surveying the past, we find that transcendence of both unenlightenment and enlightenment, and dying while either sitting or standing, have all depended entirely on the strength of zazen." [repeats it]

The notes given by Professor Abe (probably Masao Abe; see [translation of Fukanzazengi by Norman Waddell and Masao Abe](https://terebess.hu/zen/dogen/Fukanzazengi.pdf)) says, about dying while either sitting or standing: "It is written in (???) that Bodhidharma and the fourth, fifth and sixth Zen patriarchs died sitting in zazen, while the third patriarch died while standing under a large tree. Examples of both are common in the Zen histories." So from this point ... some Zen teachers kept sitting and died. Some teachers died in sitting zazen, or standing under the tree, or standing on the platform while he's giving a lecture. Anyway, there are examples in Buddhist history, but it doesn't mean you should die in sitting or standing; it doesn't mean that. The point is, how important shikantaza is, because they died in sitting, in standing. Wherever they may be, they died, in peace and harmony. Whatever they do, wherever they are, they died.

So, Dogen Zenji really wants to say about how important zazen is. That zazen is shikantaza. By that shikantaza, in the shikantaza, all delusions drop off from the first. That is dropping off body and mind; body and mind dropping off. That is zazen itself. 

(4:37) Usually, in common world, we constantly persist in our selfishness, ego consciousness, in order to accomplish our own purpose in life. Kicking out everybody; persisting, adhering to our egoistic sense. And finally, they may be disinterested in human life. There are some who commit suicide on the verge of life and death, because they are disinterested in human life after persisting in their own selfishness. Because, no one pay attention to you if you do that. Finally, those kind of people are completely isolated. 

And also, you cannot do anything in peace and harmony, you cannot live with the people in the human world in peace and harmony; so finally, it is really true that you are disinterested in human life. 

So, on the verge of life and death, there are some who commit suicide; kill themselves. Even though they can keep their life longer, they take their life.

There are some that, the death compels them to die, even though they don't want to die. There are some that they scream, right before their death, because they don't like. I know lots of examples. 

I took care of a young man who served (in the) army. At that time he was 30 years old. But at his house, for many, many years, he persisted, he really adhered to his egoistic sense, and he did as he liked. Whatever happened, kicking out everybody; he did everything that he likes. Finally, there was nothing to do which caused him to be interested in. So, he was disinterested in usual daily life. So he went and entered army. 

Well, he found a little bit interesting, a little bit fun there. Because there are lots of chances to kill a person, and animals, and using guns, and lots of fun there, which he had never experienced before; so, he enjoyed very much. But unfortunately, one day he fell down from the tree, while he was working on the tree, trimming the tree, with a Japanese hand saw. He fell down from the high tree. And finally, the bottom of his body completely numb. He couldn't walk. So, he was in the army hospital. 

But he was pretty young, 30 years old, so he had lots of energy. Still, he couldn't awaken to himself. Still, he expressed his ego, in order to accomplish his purpose of his life. Screaming at the nurses, and hitting somebody, and fighting, even though he sat down on the chair. You know the chair, using the special chair? He screams at the nurses, and fighting the nurses and doctors. Whenever I visited there, I always made every possible effort to make him calm. "Keep your mouth shut. Sit down here. Eat breakfast. Eat lunch," I always told him. But he enjoyed very much. It was a part of his life. 

And then, for three years, he got another disease, which is called - maybe a kidney didn't work. If a kidney didn't work, well, the poisons, you know, the system of, what would you say... poisons that goes around his whole body. So he couldn't have urine. So, all of a sudden, the poisons went around his body. Three days after starting to suffer from this, he died.

But right before he died, he really screamed. He really screamed, with a big voice. No one knew what to do; because, there is death. He screamed.

And then, when I visited there, he immediately grasped me, held me here, and said, "I don't want to die." 

It was his last scene(?). At the conclusion, he had for so long persisted in his egoistic sense, in order to see his purpose, the purpose of his life. That was concluded.

This is very common. Very common.

So, for such people, they never thought significance of zazen, which causes all delusions to drop off from the first. They never thought, even glancing, even once at such a wonderful world. They don't care. That is okay. 

But it is not bad to glance at that wonderful world. Even once in your whole life; that's great. It's not bad. Even though you cannot have a chance to glance at this wonderful world, even once in your whole life; but if you want to pursue this, it's not bad for us. Because life is going on. So life after life; we can do it. 

(15:15) There is a Zen story in The Blue Cliff Record; the 46th case, this is very famous Zen koan: 

> “Kyosei Zen Master (Chinese name Jingqing; Ching Ch’ing) asked a monk, “What sound is that outside the gate?” 
> 
> The monk said, “The sound of raindrops.”
> 
> Kyosei said, “Sentient beings are inverted. They lose themselves and follow after things.”
> 
> The monk said, “What about you, Teacher?”
> 
> Kyosei said, “I almost don’t lose myself.”
> 
> The monk said, “What is the meaning of ‘I almost don’t lose myself’?”
> 
> Kyosei said, “Though it should be easy to come out of freedom and say something about it, to merge oneself in freedom and say something about it has to be difficult.”

Kyosei asked a monk, his asking question is something which Kyosei Zen Master raked monks' mind in how much his practice was going on. So, "What sound is that outside the gate?" The monk said, "The sound of raindrops." But, teacher didn't ask, sound of the raindrops; he asked raindrops itself.

But, he used the words, "What's the sound outside of the gate?" So, the monk said, "That is sound of raindrops." You know the sound. Sound is not raindrops. Raindrops are raindrops. But sound comes from where? Raindrops. But sound is not raindrops. It's very clear, don't you think so? Because, raindrops are, anyway, raindrops. I cannot say - well, raindrops are active, moving; very active. Becoming one .... Or from merging of raindrops and earth and universe, at that time, this is raindrops. Before you hear the sound of raindrops, that is raindrops. But you say, "some raindrops." That is already something extra, don't you think so? You hear the sound. How long does it take to hear the sound, from the raindrop? It takes time. Even sound of the ... jet airplane. Jet airplane, you know. Can you hear the sound? I always hear the sound of a jet airplane, and then maybe I realize, "Oh, airplane up here, right above my head." Because the sound of jet airplane comes right above my head. So I look up. But, there is no airplane. Airplane is far from me, already. Do you experience this? How long does it take, to hear the sound? That is the sound. 

(20:18) And then we say, "Oh, that is a jet airplane." I don't think so; the real jet airplane has gone already. 

But so, Zen Master asked, "What sound is that outside the gate?" The monk said, "sound of the raindrops." This is very straightforward, honest monk. We do always. Maybe I say in same way, "Yes, rain. Sound of raindrops." 

And then the Zen Master points out, well, pay attention. That is okay, because without this experience, you cannot understand real rain drops. So that's alright; but pay more careful attention to sound of raindrop again. That's why Zen teacher says, "sentient beings are inverted." 

Yes, we are inverted. This is spiritual(?), don't you think so? You're sitting here. How much can you sit? How much... what is the sound of your shikantaza? Say, "Yes, sound; that is sound." What is the sound in you? You say, "sound of shikantaza," but it's too late, because real shikantaza has gone already. And then we catch the sound from the shikantaza, and when you grasp it, "that is shikantaza" - it's not shikantaza. You are already inverted. Don't you think so? And then, you just immediately; and then finally, you follow after that again and again. And then, what happens after that? Afterm following after things. After things means, sound. You know that that Dogen Zenji says, I told you often, the moment consists of 60 instances (instants?). So what you can hear - the moment is, sound of the moment. [finger snap] Like this. But, this one moment consists of 60 instances. If it is true - what did you hear? What in the moment ... have you heard? [snap] This sound, don't you think so? But this sound is nothing but sort of dregs after you squeeze(?) the 60 instances. And then you got the one grip of, you know, raindrop, just the raindrops: "I've got it." But that is one moment. But already, 60 instants you have missed. So how can you know? 

(24:06) The same applies to this monk's answer. That's why Zen Master says, "Sentient beings are inverted. They lose themselves and follow after things." At that time, you completely lose sight of yourself, because you follow after things, after sound of the raindrops. Believing, "that is raindrops." If I say, "No, it's not raindrops," you continually persist: "It's rain drops!" So finally, we fight each-other. But that means you lose sight of yourself. 

The monk said, but monk didn't understand, that's why monk asked, "What about you? How do you understand that?" And then the Zen Master says, "I almost don't lose myself." That's pretty good. [chuckles] Because, without some raindrop, you cannot listen to, you cannot understand the raindrop, what it is. How can you reach raindrop as it really is? No way. Because, it's huge. Before you conceive, before you hear the sound, that is real raindrop, how can you realize? It's not rain. It's real rain - but how can you reach there? Through only one thing, one way, you can reach, through the sound of the raindrop.

But, we shouldn't lose sight of ourself, yourself, and also you shouldn't follow after that sound of raindrops. Well, move away, move away. We always sit on the chair of the sound of the raindrop, insisting that is raindrop. But it's not raindrop. 

So, he doesn't stay there. He knows the sound of the raindrop, but it is not the raindrop. So he knows pretty well; that's why he doesn't stay there. If he doesn't stay with the sound of the raindrop, he doesn't lose himself. But without sound of the raindrop, he cannot understand the raindrops as they are; that's why he loses sight of himself. Do you understand? That's why. That's why his activity, his relationship between the raindrop and his life, always moving. Dynamically.

So he said, "Almost. I almost don't lose myself." "Almost" means constantly he is free, between raindrops and his life. If you stay even for a moment, you lose. If you ignore the sound of raindrops, you burn out, you lose. If you completely keep away from sound of drop, your life is frozen. It doesn't work. And then, if you attach to the sound of raindrops, your life burns up. What should you do? No answer. It really depends on you. But this is true.

(29:06) Same applies to the death. If you attach to the death, if you sit down in the chair of the death, that death is something extra coming upside. It really scares you. So at that time, you really burn up, burn up. We don't like it. So we say, "I hate death." But if you completely keep away from death, you forfeit. Your life doesn't work. 

So you can live full on, just imagine. If you could live full on, like a heavenly being, finally you could be disinterested in ... Because no fun. Because, fun is always there. Fun is always, constantly there. No need of trying to get the desires to get fun. Fun is always there. So finally, no fun. You are disinterested in fun. Do you understand?

(30:48) Well, it is really true. You are supported by air, hydrology, and also oxygen; carbonic acid gas, and also oxygen. Your life is supported constantly. And you are disinterested in it; you don't pay careful attention to it, because you are always basking in it. 

Only something happens which is called gap or crack. You are really confused. Only when the continuity is broken up, there is a gap. So, you are very confused. But between the air and you, are communicating very smoothly day after day - no interest there. You are disinterested in. Or, you have no idea which you are interested in or are disinterested in; completely going on. 

So the monk said, "What is the meaning of, 'I almost don't lose myself?" Zen Master says, "Though it still should be easy to come out of freedom and say something about it." If you get freedom, if you understand real meaning of raindrops. Well because, Zen Master says, you listen to, you can hear the sound of raindrops, you believe that is raindrops. But Zen teacher says, it is not raindrops. You believe the sound of the raindrops, and then, you understand really, "Oh, what is real raindrops?" That is a kind of enlightenment. 

So, you can express. If you come out of the understanding of raindrops, which is called enlightenment or freedom, then can express. But it's not so easy. It's not so easy to say something about freedom itself, raindrops themselves. When you are one with it: no, nothing to say. It's pretty hard. 

For instance, you and your air are communicating smoothly, working in themselves very smoothly - how can you say? How can you think of the situation? No explanation. But if you come out of this situation and look at the air, and look at you, and look at the very smooth functioning of your internal organs, well we say, "Oh, air. I am basking in merit of air, constantly." You say so. But it is still explanation. 

(35:06) Same applies to shikantaza. Shikantaza is just shikantaza. When you merge yourself in zazen itself, very naturally, all dualisms drop off. All verbal explanations drop off. Nothing to say. Sound of raindrops or real raindrops or not real raindrops - nothing to say, nothing to say. So, all you have to do is, just be one with shikantaza itself. At that time, very naturally, your body and mind are really basking in shikantaza; shikantaza is basking in your body and mind. They don't bother each other. Just be there, constantly. 

If you for a moment come out of this shikantaza, you can look at yourself, you can look at yourself and also many things around you, and then immediately, mind starts to attach. Making noise.

That's why this morning I told you: cease fire, completely cease fire. Cease fire doesn't mean throw away. Or, nothing to do. It's not necessary to do anything particular. Only to stop firing; stop shooting, firing. Nothing to do. Only to do is, here is shikantaza. Shikantaza, well, arranging the circumstances, and regulating the body and breath, and also regulating mind, based on no (de)sign of becoming buddha, or whatever it is. Just sit down there.

And then finally, you can stop shooting. If you do it, you can stop shooting, very naturally. Stop shooting immediately, okay? On the other hand, stop shooting catches many things. If you small sound, even a tiny sound of you falling into the floor, you can catch it. So that is completely ceasing fire. Surroundings are perfectly calm; at that time, you can catch it - everything. But all you have to do - you shouldn't fire. After thinking "sound of raindrops," all you have to do is, just be one with the raindrops. 

(39:10) What is the raindrops? Raindrops are you. Raindrops are zazen. If you create a gap between you and, well, zazen, immediately you can catch the sound you create and raindrops create. And then follow after this sound. And believe, "that is raindrop," "shikantaza." That is confusion. So completely cease firing. For this, no way. Completely nothing to do. All you have to do is, there is one, what is called shikataza - just do it. Just do, okay?

(40:16) I always tell the example (of) death because death is very good, very good example, in order to explain shikantaza, in which all delusions completely drop off. Right in the middle of death, all delusions drop off. You are qualified to accept death, or you are not qualified to accept death, or you are stupid, or you are not stupid - it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Just death. Don't you think so? If you hear the sound from zazen, from practicer(?), you say "I am qualified, to be a good student of Zen teaching, Zen student." Or, "I am not qualified, "I am stupid," "I am not stupid," "I am ... ".  But whatever you say, it's really sounds. But right in the middle of shikantaza itself, it is really exactly same as death itself. No way. Exactly no way. 

The gap is something which causes you to see something objectively. While in seeing something objectively, it creates lots of things. Fear, enjoy, criticism, judgement, good, bad; many things. But if you are one with exactly death itself, nothing to say. If you're one. 

And then - well for instance, if I die. Before (dying), I can see my death. It really scares me. "I don't want to die." Or I say, "Okay, okay; I can die." But on the other hand, I don't want to die. But death is coming up to me. So, always I discuss with death: "I like it, but I don't like it." "Well, are you sure you like death?" "No, I don't. But anyway, no way, so I like it." But, it is not honest. So, if I continue to ask myself, "Are you sure?": "I don't like it." But if you don't like, can you escape from it? No way. Because death is just coming up to me. Death is there, coming up. 

But right before, until death reaches me, well, death is still not real death. Sound of death; I always hear the sound of death. Then after the sound of death, always, it makes me confused. "I like it, I don't like it, I like it, I don't like it; oh, I don't care." Whatever you say, this nothing but hearing the sound of death, that's all. It's not real death. But if the death reaches me perfectly - no death. No suffering, no prison, no delusions. Completely all delusions drop off. And then immediately, there is a moment that comes up, which is called after death. And then Katagiri says, "Oh. I died." But if I died... [laughter] I cannot see died. But anyway, let's see a movie. I look at the death, and then lots of sounds comes up, and then I say, criticizing, "Oh, I like it," for Katagiri, patting my head;  and also, fighting death, and sometimes shaking hands with death, and sometimes escaping from; sometimes playing hide and seek with death. But whatever happens, death is continually coming up to me; this is reality. This is very normal. 

(45:46) So finally, whatever you say; I say, that is dualistic world. Lots of things come up. Stumbling over whatever I say, finally, what happens? All I have to do is, to merge myself in death as it really is. Because it's real. So finally, death says, "Hi." If you say, "Hi," I can answer "hi," because, it's only one(?).

... What I have to say, or I shouldn't say, "Hi." I should give answer to death, "hi" or not. No delusions. Completely all delusions drop off, if I become one with death, exactly. And then, movie still going on. That is life.

[tape change]

(47:08) ... death. Coming out of enlightenment. So I can say, "Ha. That is death." But still, it's not real death. Do you understand? It's not real death. 

That's why Zen master says, it's not so easy to face death itself. Rain drops itself. Whenever you merge yourself in itself, exactly there, you cannot say, you cannot say anything at all. 

But mind is pretty picky. Mind is very picky. Always picking up. That's why you don't know; you're confused. But death is very good example; that's why I always use the example of death. 

So recently we had tragic accident of the airplane very often. I always think of the people who died, who are dying. If I were them, I always think, what should I do? What happens, in my life? I can think of lots of things.

But whenever I get a solution, through the Zen stories, koans, or shikantaza, dropping off body and mind, whatever you say - it's completely words. Words. Don't you think so? If you face death, it's no time to discuss. No time to discuss.

And then, ... what you could do, right in the middle of that situation. No guarantee. No guarantee. "I should do this, or that." No. I don't have anything to promise you. "I can die in peace and harmony right in the middle of such a situation" - I cannot say so. Or I cannot say, "I am completely confused and scream" - I cannot say so. I don't know. Actually, I don't know what to do. 

(50:18) This is reality, okay? This is reality. So that's why we are practicing shikantaza. If you use zazen as a means, zazen doesn't work. Doesn't work right in the middle of the problem of, right in the middle on the verge of life and death - it doesn't make sense. Don't you think so? For instance, "Zazen gives you lots of strength, so you should do zazen." So you are interested in such a zazen. "Through zazen lots of ways of regulating breath, and step by step, there are lots of techniques." So you follow this technique and you can completely take care of breath, perfectly. And then you so, "Oh, my zazen is perfect." And then, still you don't believe, so we try to buy the machine, brain waves, and connect it. [some shuffling, chuckling from group] Look at this through your brain. Let's start to do zazen - how about breath, how about body? [sound of patting self] Body is okay; yes, okay. How about breath? Breath is okay? Yes, okay. Well, even though you don't say, machine says its okay. No, so how about brain and nerve system? So you connect it. You plug me in, and brain is constantly going there. And then, machine says, "Oh, your brain is calm now." [group laughter] So you say, "Wow! Wonderful! I (am) enlightened person." That's interesting. Don't you think so? That's great. So, finally, you cannot stop looking at the machine. [laughter] Finally, you try to connect the money to buy that machine. [more laughter] And connecting that machine ... sitting zazen right in front of the machine. Without the machine, you cannot do zazen. Because, nothing to prove your zazen, as a means. So you continue to sit right in the front go the machine. So, every day sit; every day, machine says, "Your brain good!" "Good!" "Good!" And then you say, "My zazen (is) perfect." And then psychologists make the datas and say, "Katagiri's zazen (is) perfect. This is what is called shikantaza; all delusions drop off." [laughter] I don't think so. [laughter] I don't think so. [laughs] And then, next moment, psychologist says, "May I borrow your machine?" [laughter] And then, I cannot stop sitting, so without machine, I have to do zazen. What should I do? No clue! And then, immediately my mind going on; not perfect. So I cannot do zazen without machine. Don't you think so? 

(54:16) Well, zazen, shikantaza is completely perfect. Here is a good example in San Francisco. This man was a little bit ??? Ten years ago, Japanese scholars were interested in checking the brain waves during zazen, so it influenced American scholars. So American scholars started to check the Zen teachers and students; and so, I was one of the students, and he was interested in checking my brain. I didn't like it, but Suzuki said, "Why don't you go there?" [laughter] But he didn't go. [louder laughter] He didn't go, but he asked me, "why don't you go there," so I went. [laughter] One gentleman was very interested in checking his brain, so he went to hospital every day, because he was very interested. So every day he went there, and psychology student really appreciated him because he completely offered his brain with his zazen. He enjoyed very much every day, and checked, and checked, and finally there is data, says: "Your zazen is perfect." Well, he couldn't stop. Still, he wanted to go there and check his brain. Because, he didn't have his life with confidence, without machine. So finally he bought it. He bought the machine. Then he put the machine - machine said, "You're good... Uh-oh you aren't." ... [laughter] Very comic. It's very comic, what occurs in the modern Zen. Sitting in zazen, in the back of the screen, completely missed. Even though zazen machine says, "your brain is calm"; very neat - but behind the screen, completely mess. Because he doesn't know what to do. Without machine, mess appears. ... So he's confused.

(57:40) So if you use zazen like this, as a means, it doesn't make sense. Even though for three years you use zazen and get a strong feeling and spirit in your life, but, it doesn't connect with problem of life and death. No connection. So finally, forget it. All you have to do is, you have to be one with shikantaza. That's all. Right now, right here. That's all you have to do. And then at that time, we can say, all delusions drop off. But that is explanation, after. Raindrops touch the ground, make a sound, coming out of enlightenment - and then I can say, that is sound of raindrops. But it's not real raindrops. We're always here, keeping our distance.

Shikantaza is, Dogen Zenji says, "Zazen is dropping off body and mind." Remember this. Your whole life, you should remember. "Zazen is dropping off body and mind" means all delusions drop off. That means exactly same as death. Death is exactly same as life. So how can I say? How can I check? While all delusions drop off, right in the middle of death - nothing. Nothing to say. But, when you become one with death, all delusions drop off. Otherwise, you cannot become one with death. Don't you think so? It is really true. Completely drop off.

(1:00:02) But we don't do that. Taking away all delusions and then I want to be one - it's too late; you cannot do this. You have to be one anyway. If you're one, all delusions drop off very naturally. But we don't believe, because we get use of, always keeping a certain distance and hear the sound, always, and believe that is real world. And continue to follow after that. That's why we are inverted. Perverted.

(1:00:57) If you look at the Zen teachers in the United States, I don't believe there are any good Zen teachers. If you check all Zen teachers, according to Dogen and buddhas: no real Zen teachers. I'm sorry for you. No Zen teacher. Failure of Zen teacher. Failure. But this is explanation of Zen teacher, understanding of Zen teacher. Then, if you say, "I am failure of Zen teacher" - why don't you give it away, and return to normal life? Of course, it's very reasonable; but I don't want. Even though you say, "I am failure of Zen teacher; I don't want to come back; I want to be dead." Because, we can do shikantaza. Shikantaza is really compassion, really compassion. But, this is really strict. No way. All we have to do is, whatever people say - "You are failure of Zen teacher" or "You are great Zen teacher," it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. All you have to do is listen to the sound of the raindrops. On the other hand, you cannot stay there. All you have to do is, you have to stand up there, stand up right in the middle of raindrops as they really are, where all delusions drop off. You are qualified or you are not qualified, it doesn't matter; anyway, you have to be there. That is real practice, real practice. You should do this. And then, you can create great teacher, I can create great teacher. This is important. 

So, if you don't like; if you look at the United States, I promise, there is no good teacher. No good teacher. If some teacher believes, "I am best" - well, that is fake. If some Zen teacher says, "I am fake, so I don't want to be teacher," - this is also fake. Do you understand? [someone laughs] This is also fake. But whatever happens, all we have to do is, to be present right in the middle of death itself, life itself, where all delusions drop off. Qualified or not qualified - it doesn't matter. But you cannot ignore; you should accept. But all we have to do is, just practice this. At that time, you can find great teacher, finally. Teacher finds great teacher. 

So, some teacher says, "I am not qualified to be teacher," so he returns to normal life. But what he does - he does same things as before. Don't you think so? Same things. I know several people. And also he makes announcement in public: "I am no longer priest." But this is wonderful. But what he does is the same thing. 

What would you like, okay? There is, stinky, muddy water; there is beautiful water. But both be same. And usually the same things. Wherever you may be; beautiful, nice place, nice smell, beautiful place. Or here is muddy and stinky, and lots of things. That is samsaric world. And here is another beautiful world. But both be same. And whatever you may be, you can do things - what would you like? What would you *be*? What would you prefer to be? Would you want be stinky, muddy ...  Do you understand?

(1:06:50) Well, if I've been, if you are beautiful place ... remember this. Many people bark at you. Because you are already beautiful place. That's when you can see "that's the ugly thing." If you make a mistake, lots of things happen.

And then immediately you ask it, "That is something extra." If you do this, you never touch the core of human life. So, all are buddha, all are buddha. Muddy water, beautiful water; all buddha. Whatever you may be, you can do same things; buddha's world. Which would you like? It's very clear. No one prefers dirty place. Don't you think so? Very simple practice. But if you are beautiful place, it's not so easy. It's not so easy. But we should accept. 

And all we have to do is, whatever you may be, we can do same thing. That same thing is, shikantaza. Shikantaza, where all delusions drop off, from the first. It's not necessary you should find some order or demand. "Go away": you cannot say so. If you say "go away," they don't go away. Even though you say "please stay," they don't stay.

That's why Dogen Zenji says, "dying while either sitting or standing, have all depended" ... no, excuse me. "We find that transcendence of both unenlightenment or enlightenment" - that is good or bad, right, wrong, qualified or not qualified, whatever you say. Transcend - this is shikantaza itself. Anyway, transcend. Death or life - transcend of death and life. And then all you have to do is, be one with death, when death comes. That is shikantaza. At that time, you can die while you're sitting. You can die while you're standing. Very naturally. You can die lying down on your bed. You can die at home ... "Have all depended entirely on the strength of zazen." This is zazen. Yes it is.
