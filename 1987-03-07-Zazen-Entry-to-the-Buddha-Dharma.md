**Katagiri Roshi:** During the training session starting this week we [will] study the questions and answers which occur toward the end of *Bendowa*, written by Dogen. 

The first question, second question, Dogen Zenji mentions how important zazen or Zen meditation is. First question is,

> Now I have heard and understand the sublime merits of Zazen. 

Before this question and answer Dogen Zenji mentions the sublimity of the practice of Zazen. So that's why he says now I have heard and understand the sublime merits of Zazen. 

> However, an unthinking person might have doubts and say, there are many entrances to the Buddha Dharma

 many entrances to the Buddha's world or spiritual world or universal world whatever you say. There are many ways. 
 
> There are many entrances to the Buddha Dharma. What is the reason for your advocacy of zazen alone? 

So answer is 

> Because it is right entrance to the Buddha Dharma. 

Here it says, reason is why we have to practice Zazen first as sublimity of practicing and studying Buddha's teaching. It is because it is right entrance to the Buddha Dharma, right entrance. 

And the second question is,

> why is it alone the right entrance? 

The answer is,

> the great teacher Shakyamuni Buddha beyond doubt rightly transmitted zazen as the wonderful means for attaining the way. Also, the totalities of the three periods all attain the way through zazen. That is the reason they have transmitted from one to another as the right entrance. That is not all. Patriots from the western skies of India to the eastern earth of China all have gained the way through zazen. Therefore, I now point it out to men and devas as the right entrance. 

So this answer is very interesting. The question number two is, why is zazen alone the right entrance? The answer is the great, tender Shakyamuni Buddha beyond doubt...  beyond doubt Shakyamuni Buddha and ancestors, many Buddhas, transmitted the wonderful means for attaining the way. Also, the totalities of the three periods all attain the way through zazen. That is the reason they have transmitted from one to another as the right entrance. That means beyond doubt. Anyway, Buddha Shakyamuni and many Buddhas ancestors just accept this practice of Zazen and learn what the Buddha's teaching is, what the universe is, what the peaceful life is. That’s why it is called right entrance. Right entrance to the Buddha Dharma, to the universe. Right entrance to get into the peaceful world. 

So in this case, I think the most important point is, in Zen Buddhism particularly, Dogen Zenji mentioned about right entrance. *Right* means that you have to learn something straightforward without, how can I say, artifice or design, without intention or purposes. 

Let me say like this. When you devote yourself to do something using your intention and will, consciousness or with a purpose, and then if you continue to devote yourself to accomplish one thing you want to do, finally you discover that there is no sign of intention and purpose, because your whole body and mind becomes one and they work together. 

For instance, if you look at the football game and the tea ceremony and archery, or whatever you do, climb the mountains, rough mountains, first of all you have to use your consciousness and intention instead of being enslaved by consciousness or your intentions. You really have to use intention and consciousness and be one with the rock mountains and the football. And then you will discover that there is no sign of intention or purpose, because purpose and intentions are completely melted away right in the middle of dynamic activity of climbing the mountain and playing the football, between the ball and you, between a rock mountain and you. That is called, what would you say, straightforward, to learn something straightforward without intention or artifice or design or purposes. It doesn't mean you should ignore or destroy your consciousness or etc. Is that clear? And that is one point. 

The second point is, what is learning? To learn is not to know something or to put the knowledge into your head. To learn is what is called *manebi* in Japanese. *Manebi* means root of learn in Japanese. *Manebi* means to imitate or emulate. This is called to learn in Japanese. But if you say to learn or to study something, you have immediate preconception that you should get some knowledge from object, from teacher or from your activity, et cetera. But this is not real learning, because from this you never experience totally ripeness. It's pretty difficult to deepen your life. In order to deepen your life or in order to make your life ripe, I think you should learn human life in the universal perspective. In other words, you should put yourself in the total picture of your life interconnected, interpenetrated with all beings. *Then* you can learn something. That is called to learn. So to learn is to emulate, to imitate something. 

That's why here it says, "Shakyamuni Buddha and ancestors, all teachers, anyway, without any doubt, beyond doubt, transmit this sublime practice of meditation from generation to generation up to now, whatever ages change." So that is most important. How can you learn the sublimity of human life from your parents, your superior, your grandparents, your grand-grandparents? How do you learn? It's pretty difficult to learn the sublimity of your grandparents' life and your grandparents' life and your American ancestors' life. It's pretty hard. Of course you can learn, you can have lots of knowledge of American ancestors from the book, from the teachers, but that is pretty shaky because that knowledge disappears sooner or later. And also, those knowledge doesn't penetrate your body and skin. So I think knowledge is important, but the most important point is you have to learn the sublimity of human life from your grandparents, from the teachers, from your friends, from the superior. How? Just, hou have to imitate. Emulate.

But maybe you have a question, why do we have to emulate or imitate somebody's life? You know? That's why Zen Buddhists always complain, you know. Teacher says you should do this or you shouldn't do that, immediately Zen students start to complain, because I don't want to, I don't want to be blind, you know. I don't want to lose myself. Of course, I understand. *[Laughter.]* Because pretty self-centeredness, you know? Not only Americans - everyone. But particularly I am very surprised to see American students emphasizing always, "I come first." *[He laughs, and the group.]* I don't know how to deal with it. *[Laughter.]* But I must be always patient, and right in the middle of that self-centeredness, you always present, and also I always demonstrate who I am, [...] I always demonstrate what I am and that which I have learned from the teachers, anyway, Buddha’s teaching, et cetera. 

So I think this is the most important practice for us. Imitating is not to be a parrot. Okay? Do you understand? Parrot? “Good morning,” you say, “good morning.” *[Laughter.]* It is not imitate or emulate. In human history, we found the fact that the two trees, you know, rubbed each other and make a fire. Finally it makes a fire. And then, human being discovered the way how to make a fire through this fact. And then human being just imitate. Do you know how to make a fire in the ancient time? Human beings exactly imitate what the tree did in order to make a fire. So, I think the imitation or emulation, emulate doesn't mean just to imitate, but you have to have a creative life. From imitation, from emulating somebody's life, and then you can create your life. Otherwise, how can you deepen your life? 

So, this is most important point, alright? 

So, that is entrance, right entrance, right entrance to Buddha Dharma. If you want to get into what the peaceful world or what the peaceful spiritual life is, you don't get any knowledge from that, you know. So, you have to put yourself right in the middle of peaceful spiritual life. Mentions or suggested by teachers and the Buddha's teaching anyway, we have to imitate, emulate. 

That is a zazen, anyway, okay? 

So, next question is, how can you put yourself right in the middle of ... zazen, and then what you can learn?

 Then Dogen Zen says, "Sanzen is Zazen." Sanzen means surrendering, means to surrender to simplicity, simplicity in life. This is sanzen, which is translated usually as "the practice." The practice is to surrender to simplicity in life. Simplicity means that which is pretty neat and tidy, [unsophisticated], pretty simple, and also within the simple manifestation of life, there is a rich quality of life there. It's simple, but it's not simple you usually understand, but within the simplicity of your life, there are lots of rich, abundant qualities of human life. That is called ripeness. 
 
So sanzen, if you, sanzen is, how can you surrender to simplicity in life? So, Dogen Zenji mentions, that is zazen. And then he says zazen is *shinjin dotsuraku*, that means casting off body and mind, in other words, dropping off body and mind. Or, he says, "Dullness and distraction are struck aside from the beginning." Dullness and distraction are not something you try to remove. If you try to remove, you create more distraction and dullness. Because dullness and distractions are something that they're created, produced by your attitude, by your actions, activities. So according to conditioned circumstances, conditional element, conditional circumstances. So you don't know how to be free from. 

No matter how long you use the technique, psychologically, philosophically, or scientifically, you never get, you know, freedom from dullness and distraction. The moment when you feel freedom from dullness and distraction, immediately you are confused. Right in the middle of freedom of dullness and distraction. That's why human beings constantly seek for the psychologist to let you be free from dullness and distractions. You know? You always feed the psychologist. *[He laughs.]* 

So at the dropping off body and mind, if you do zazen, simultaneously the dullness and distractions are struck aside from the beginning. This is a key point of zazen. That's why Dogen Zenji mentions, “this is the essential art of zazen.”

Okay, let me say this one. What do you mean by dropping off body and mind? The moment when you do zazen, the moment when you devote yourself in zazen. Let me say it like this. That means, let's imagine that you would be in the bathtub in the cold weather, in the rigors of Minnesota winter. And then your body becomes very cold. After that, you put your body right in the middle of bathtub, hot bath, okay? The moment when you put your body and mind in the hot bathtub, what do you say? What do you say? 

“Ah.”

“Ah!” *[Laughter.]* 

That's pretty simple. That's it. It's no particular word, that's a simple word. Simple word means ground word, coming from the bottom of your heart. When your body and mind becomes one with the hot water and hot bathtub and all circumstances including your memories, and distractions, dullness, all stuff. And then when you become completely one with bathtub, then you can demonstrate simplicity in life. So-called, “Ah.” That's it. 

Within the “Ah,” who are they? Who are they? 

Can you pick up something particular? Pay attention to the just moment, at the very moment when you say “Ah.” Who are they? What is it? What is there? Can you say it? 

After “Ah,” you pick up you, who says “Ah.” But I am talking about *before* you say “Ah.” Okay? 

Here is a partition, very thin partition just like cotton. Cotton, cotton is a very thin cotton. Silk, very thin silk. Not silk... Silk is still touchable, but that partition is not touchable but it's still something there. Do you understand? Just like a mist. But a mist is pretty hard to grasp it, but it's there. And then if you touch it, it disappears and you can get it next door. This is a [...] door. 

So this partition, when you are coming back to your home, and you put your body and mind in the bath tub. And then immediately within this partition you create your own life. So-called “Ah”: simple life. 

And then right before this partition, right before you touch, this is the very moment, beginning of the moment. Very moment, before you think of it, before something runs through your consciousness. In that area, I think your body and your consciousness and waters becomes exactly one. That area, that situation is never described, but your body and the waters [are] functioning simultaneously, together.

And then next moment you say “Ah.” That is the next moment. And then when you say “Ah,” people are very interested in “Ah” which you have demonstrated. And then, you are involved in so much what Ah means. *[Laughter.]* Or what are they? Hot water and your body and mind, who makes me saying “Ah”? Something like that. This is a scientific, you know, civilization, modern civilization. And then finally you don't know where are you going. 

And also you completely forget the first stage, the very first stage of your life. Completely you forget. First stage of your life, there are many beings which are functioning interpenetratedly, interconnectedly, together. This is oneness. You look at this sunny, wonderful day, you know? Well, how many beings exist? When you feel that wonderful sunny day. You say “Ah, wonderful.” And before you say wonderful, how many beings are working together interpenetratedly, without any hindrances? This is called the universe, we say, this is called oneness. In the oneness, that is a place where all beings come together and are working together and walking hand in hand, without hindrances, creating a peaceful world. 

Even not only in Minnesota. Minnesota, the rigors of Minnesota winter shakes a hand with the winter of Hawaii, in peace. You don't believe it, but this is the truth. The Japanese monkey talks peacefully with the elephant in India. Can you believe it? You don't believe it. But this is the place where all sentient beings come together and talk together, which is called oneness. We say universe, we say the truth. 

But if you are involved so much in the dualistic world, after creating a “wow”, you completely forget that first stage of your life. That's why spiritual life is constantly to let you get back to the first stage, OK? The first stage of a “wow.” That's it. That's why you don't understand it. But when you are there, completely the dullness and distraction, the form of five skandhas, are struck aside from the beginning. And then, what do you mean? Your body and hot water becomes one. This is called *intimacy*. Perfect intimacy. Secret intimacy we say. Secret, very secret, secret intimacy. No gap between. This is called *right*, meaning of the *right*. 

And also that is a gate entrance to communicate with the universe. *Universe* means total picture of your life working together with all sentient beings. Okay?

So that is called *dropping off body and mind*. When you do zazen, immediately you say "Ah!" That's it. But you don't say "Ah!" because zazen has no particular object, so-called bathtub, you know? So that's why you don't know. You are always using your mind and body and that's it. That is your subjectivity and also objective. And then whole world comes into you. And then, that is called, when you say "Wow!" this is called *samadhi* we say. *Concentration*, okay? Total concentration, total devotion. And also this is called *jijiyu samadhi*, self-joyousness. *Self-joyous samadhi*, we call it. In other words, this is called "Ah!" That's it. 

But in zazen, you cannot say "Ah," because everyone becomes quiet. *[Chuckles.]* So, you have to enjoy the self-joyous samadhi concentration right in the middle of zazen. Okay? 

This is dropping of body and mind. And then this is what makes it possible for this, dropping off body and mind? It is idea? It is concept or perception? No. Just activity there. 

Total activity, which is neat and tidy, so-called simplicity. Simple activity. Simple activity means using your consciousness and using your whole body with wholeheartedness and then jump into the zazen and then this is called simplicity. 

That is called activity. Our activity is usually very complicated, but in zazen activity is very simple, which means very tidy and neat and sophisticated. Very pure, simple. So, this is why that simple activity is important. In order to experience intimacy. Intimacy. Okay? So let me explain this one once more again. 

Dogen Zenji explains about washing the robe. How can you wash the robe, in *Shobogenzo*? Using the water of ashes. In ancient time we didn't have soap, so using the water of ashes. I don't want to explain this one, so I want to explain [using] your washing machine. 

So, look at the washing machine. If you want to wash your dirty clothes, you have to put the dirty clothes in the washing machine, and also, next, pure, clean water there. That is called dualistic world: dullness, distractions. And good or bad, right and wrong, phenomenal world. 

And then, when you put the water in the dirty clothes, and then next, what do you do? 

**People:** Soap.

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yes, soap. And then what do you do? 

**People:** Turn it on.

**Katagiri Roshi:** Turn it on! *[He laughs.]* If you turn it on, then what happens? 

**Someone:** It agitates. [...] *[Laughter.]*

**Katagiri Roshi:** If you turn it on, what happens? 

**People:** It mixes it all together.

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yeah, mixes together. What makes it possible for something to mix it together? 

**Someone:** It goes around. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Turn around. Yes. Moving. Machine moving.

**Someone from before:** Agitating!

**Katagiri Roshi:** Oh, that’s what I mean. So I’m sorry. *[Laughter.]*

Anyway, moving. Machine [is] moving: that is our practice, so-called simple activities, constantly. Alright?

And then, simple activity, by the standing on the simple activity, then you can create the world, so-called, dullness and distraction, pure and impure, good or bad, right and wrong, funny guys and beautiful men, sunny days and winters, and many things can happen. Alright? That is called “dirty clothes in clean water.” Purity or impurity. 

And then the people are very interested in impurity or purity. And then finally they don't know what to do. Do you understand? 

But actually, under the dirty clothes and under the clean water, what's there? 

Under all circumstances, always there is movement there. Alright? And *then*, you can create... Pay attention to this one, alright? Don't forget this one. Whatever happens, you like or you don't like, there is a wonderful world there. That is called *whole universe*, you say. Sometimes you say, "Universe takes care of me." What do you mean, *the universe*? Universe is not a concept. Universe is not something you can get by your head trip. Universe is something *active*. If you believe there is a universe, universe must be manifested or realized in your everyday life. Otherwise, no sense of universe. 

So, there is a universe which is beyond your consciousness, but that universe must be manifested, realized by *you*, in your everyday life. At that time, universe becomes, anyway, *phenomenal world*. Okay? Universe blooms its flower, so-called phenomenal world, pure [and] impure. Like this. What is a pure sense of the universe? Pure sense of universe is constantly moving. Under dirty clothes and clean water, which you cannot see. So, movement is invisible. 

So, under all circumstances, whatever you feel from your life, whatever you feel from the world, there is always universe which is working, active, very much... to support all sentient beings, to create the human world. And then, what happens? Then, there is nothing to attach to so-called dirty clothes, because dirty clothes turn into clean clothes. Clean water becomes dirty water. But usually, people don't believe this, because if you have a concept, so-called clean water, you believe that it must be always clean, *always*! But that is idealistically it's true, but it doesn't work in your everyday life. Is that clear? 

So, clean water must be dirty water in order to make the dirty clothes clean! That is a phenomenal world, that is called *intimacy*, that is called *interdependent co-origination*. Helping each other. Alright? 

So, all we have to do is, all we have to do is to practice zazen with total activity, which is simple, tidy, and neat. And sophisticated. Okay? 

And then, you can see the nightmare and the fears and many things. But if you always concentrate on these activities, distraction [is] coming up, but it turns into a not-distractions, because always that moving makes it something different. Just like a washing machine. 

So, you don't believe that if you sit down exactly, dullness and distraction are struck aside from the beginning, [as Dogen Zenji says]. But that is called the unique way to participate in peaceful, harmonious, spiritual life. Otherwise, no way. No way. 

How do you do this? You have to just emulate this practice. Imitate. As exactly what the ancestors and Buddhists have done. You have to do it. And then, you can really deepen your life, and that practice makes your life ripe. 

And then from this ripeness, from this deepening your life, then you can create philosophy, psychology from this, depth of well. Psychology and philosophy and religious teaching coming up. But people who completely understand the religious teaching are reversed, in the opposite way. First, there is a teaching, and then we try to mold our life into the teaching. *[He laughs.]* Or try to get the knowledge from the teaching, and then try to be free from something. You cannot do it, because your body and mind are always supported by the movement in dynamism, so-called universe. 

So, who is Katagiri? Katagiri is Katagiri. Finally, what do you mean? Katagiri creates his own phenomenal world, but on the other hand, Katagiri has to stand up constantly in this total dynamic activities, as best as he can. And then, he can deepen his life. Same applies to your life, whatever you do. This is called ...

*[Tape change.]*

... and then Dogen Zenji, here it says, “This is called right entrance to the Buddha Dharma.” Right entrance to get into, to participate in peaceful and harmonious human life.

Do you have a question? 

#### 45:50

**Question:** I have two. The first one has to do, way at the beginning of your lecture, you talked about will and activity. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Will. 

**Questioner:** Will, purpose, design. And you said that... I wasn't quite sure what you said. It sounded to me like you said that, she would start out with will and purpose, and then it would disappear as you became more one with the activity. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** If you use it, if you use the will, intention, and volition, instead of being enslaved by, slave.

**Questioner:** Can you talk about what the difference is? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** “Slave” means your intention, your will, is not manifested in a simple way, because it is connected with the heredity, and karma, and the past life, and also memories, et cetera, and also your five skandhas, your body. So it's pretty complicated. So if you try to manifest your will, intention, it doesn't manifest itself in a simple way. It's a little bit complicated. 

**Questioner:** Uh-huh.

**Katagiri Roshi:** That's why I said, instead of being enslaved by intention or purpose, and your will, we have to use them. That means, you must be master of yourself in whatever situation you may be. In other words, not to lose [sight] of yourself. Do you understand? No? 
 
**Questioner:** Not really. I'm not sure what it means, not to lose sight of yourself. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** For instance, intention. I want to do zazen. Okay? So that intention originally must be very simple. So that intention lets you do something very simply, and totally simply, directly, straightforwardness. Okay? 

**Questioner:** Okay.

**Katagiri Roshi:** But if you start to do it, *[he laughs,]* intention gradually will be vague. You know? 

**Questioner:** Kind of like, if I want to do zazen because I'd like to be a great master, because I'd like to...

**Katagiri Roshi:** Right. Very complicated. In the beginning, first beginning of intention is a little bit clear and very nice. But the second stage, second moment, intention becomes a little bit mixed up by something else, you know? Because immediately in the first moment, you have experienced something which seems to be good, and then you say, "Wonderful!" *[He laughs.]* And then the intention becomes a little bit, you know, a little bigger. And the next moment, you don't experience something nice, so intention becomes pretty dejected... Dejected? Degenerated? No. A little bit confused.

So, intention originally is very simple, but it's not, so finally, you are enslaved by intention. 

**Questioner:** I understand. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Okay. Next question? 

**Questioner:** Can I ask another question? [...] Towards the end of the lecture, you were talking about the dualistic world, good and bad, or destruction, destruction was the word that you used. And you said that from this activity, the dualistic world, destruction and creation, maybe, I don't know, from the other side, would arise. But then, as it arose, the destruction, because of the activity, would become something else. So, what should be our attitude then, toward that destruction? (*Transcriber’s Note:* This is a mishearing; the word used was ‘distraction’, as in “dullness and distraction.”)

**Katagiri Roshi:** So, that's toward, you should stand up constantly in the place of total activity. Just like a machine, okay? Which is tidy and neat, so simple activities. Alright? As best as you can. This is the attitude toward distractions, and dullness, and suffering and [lots of] stuff. So, your basic activity must be simple and neat, as best as you can. When you get the opportunity, even one moment, you try. Okay? 

That's why we do zazen. Zazen is simple. 

**Questioner:** And it will change. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** I *hope*. *[Laughter.]* But don't *expect* [it]. Because it's not your business. [It’s] universal business. 

That's why Dogen Zenji says, “You throw away yourself into the Buddha's world, then you are drawn in by Buddha's world, without using your effort.” 

Because, climbing the mountain, in the beginning you use intention and purpose, and through experiencing the lots of complicated procedure, but the more you devote yourself into the rock mountains, and then finally you forget yourself, you go beyond time, and finally between the rock mountains and you, very nice communication between, kind of energies. And then finally, even though you don't use any effort, you just climb the mountains. So finally, you can stop it. 

So *who* climbs the mountains? Mountain climbs the mountains. That's it. 

Finally. But usually through this spiritual life, you don't believe this. But climb the mountains, and the dancers, and the writers, and many people experience this. That's why I suggest reading the book...

**Questioner:** The one that costs $25? *[Laughter.]*

**Katagiri Roshi:** [*Beyond Boredom and Anxiety*.] (The updated version is *Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience*, by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.) You can read that book, pretty interesting book. It's pretty close to Zen teaching – not exactly, but it doesn't matter, you know? It's very interesting. Twenty-five dollars. *[Laughter.]*

**Someone:** You can get it in the library.

**Someone:** Oh, good. [...]

**Questioner:** So we shouldn't... Secretly, we may have a feeling that we want that destruction to go away, right? [...]

**Katagiri Roshi:** First point, I think if you say distraction, and the confusions, and the human world, I think first of all, well I mentioned the stand up in the total activity which is neat, and simple, and tidy. Okay? 

**Questioner:** Mm-hmm.

**Katagiri Roshi:** That is *how*. You must be a little bit... not a little bit. You must be magnanimous. Magnanimous means generous. Your mind first, generous. You know, generosity means not let you be mean, nasty. If you see confusions and angers, et cetera, you shouldn't be nasty. It's pretty easy for us to be nasty, because if you act on angers, and distraction, and suffering, et cetera, according to your emotion, immediately you become nasty pretty easily. So, you shouldn't be nasty because, you know, dirty clothes turn into the clean waters, naturally. Because behind the dirty clothes and clean waters, so, always [there is] the total activity, which is invisible. What makes dirty clothes to clean? That is the activity behind. Okay?

**Questioner:** Okay. Yeah, I guess that's what I was asking you, whether you meant that what arose as destruction, okay, initially... [through the form]

**Katagiri Roshi:** Well, through that, that's why if you become generous, I think the first point is you shouldn't be nasty. [...] Which means you shouldn't act on immediately, according to your preconception, according to your understanding, immediately. Okay? Take time, and be generous. And then, very naturally, you can see the distraction in a broad scale, little by little. Alright? 

**Questioner:** Okay.

**Katagiri Roshi:** And then, second is, you should learn the broad scale of the human life through distraction and suffering, et cetera. Sickness, old age... Okay? It's not bad. I hope! *[Laughter.]* But in the sense inside, burning. Okay? Inside burning. Your insides, screaming. Do you understand? 

In other words, you don't accept, your mind doesn't accept. But that's alright. Through the suffering and the pains, you can learn a lot. Alright?

Any other? 

#### 58:29

**Question:** I have one. When you say “zazen is the way,” by *zazen*, do you mean sitting in a zendo regularly, or something ... in general, by that? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Well, regularly, that is the best way. Regularly on the daily basis, that is kind of making fire by rubbing the two trees or two branches. If you stop it, you miss the chance to make fire. So on the daily basis, this is pretty nice. But still, it is difficult according to the individual circumstances. (*Transcriber’s Note:* It seems that Katagiri Roshi didn’t hear the second part of the question.)

**Questioner:** But essentially, you see that it should be with the group and with the teacher, as opposed to in some... less structured way. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Not [necessarily], you can practice by yourself. But I think practice by yourself, sitting at your home is nice, but sometimes your practice is going in a different way which you have never seen before. Unconsciously, you are going in a different way, which you have never expected. So you need a lot of help. *[Laughter.]* 

Because if you sit down, how many consciousnesses you can see? You know? And what kind of experience you have had? It’s very difficult for us to “solve,” and to know how to deal with those experiences. So finally you need guidance, you need help, in many ways. 

As your circumstances allow, we try to practice together. But if you cannot, well, you can practice at your home. That’s fine. 

#### 1:00:55

**Question:** I have a question. You were talking about in the washing machine, the dirty water, and the clean water and the clothes. And I can understand the action of the universe underneath it that’s invisible. But I don't understand what the action of the universe underneath sitting zazen would be. Because it is still. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** It’s not still. It’s still, but active, both. You can see both. 

Because if you sit in the stillness perfectly, you can see the lots of activity of your body and mind, you can get lots of energy. So totally your whole body is working smoothly. So it’s not still. And also you can see the universe in equality, and your mind becomes peace, because your mind penetrates to every inch of beings, trees, birds, and pebbles, and you can share your life. 

Most people say that sitting is pretty *inactive*, so they want to help people. Instead of sitting zazen, always, “I want to help human beings,” and caring [for the poor], et cetera. That movement is more attractive to us. But that is a misunderstanding. I don't mean you *shouldn't* do it. If you want to do it, that's fine. But if you want to seek the peaceful spiritual life, I think you have to learn what it is. 

And also, if you have such a movement, peace work movement [or] whatever, I think in the total activity there must be always peace. Otherwise you cannot deal with your activity in dynamism, sharing your life with all sentient beings.

**Question:** Hojo-san? A few weeks ago, somebody asked you about joy, and you said that joy is ego too? And that feelings, emotions, including joy, are all coming from the ego? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yeah, joy is connected with self-consciousness, self-centeredness, pretty much. Because it is something which you have experienced. Okay?

**Same person:** Mm-hmm. But Hojo-san, what about the story of the monk who gets up and dances for joy, for year after year, before he hits the meal han or whatever, before he announces the meal? Do you remember that story? *[Laughter.]*

**Katagiri Roshi:** Zenko? Hitting the han? In his whole life?

Yeah, I can understand. I don't know. But that is ... well if you explain it, you can use the term *joyousness*. But that joyousness which is manifested in his life is something still, and quiet, invisible. Because it is very personal. Okay? Real peaceful joyousness is very personal. Is that okay? 

It’s very difficult to tell you, or it’s very difficult to give it to you to understand it. No. 

**Same person:** So you are saying there are two kinds of joy, one which is ego and one which is very quiet, that we don't understand yet, that isn't ego.

**Katagiri Roshi:** Mm-hmm. So, joyousness is based on self-centeredness and also not self-centeredness, both. So that’s why self-centeredness turned into the not self-centeredness, by quiet dynamic movement. So-called washing machine, anyway. 

Do you understand? No? 

**Same person:**A little bit. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Okay. Good. That’s enough. [Thank you.] *[Laughter.]*
