##### 0:00 start of recording

Probably you may notice that there are many English terms in Buddhism using ‘all sentient beings’ or ‘all dharmas’. In the four vows, we say, “I vow to save all sentient beings.” Whatever Buddhist scriptures you read, you realize there are many Buddhist terms, ‘all dharmas’, ‘all sentient beings’. That’s why we are very often confused: “to save all sentient beings” – what do you mean, save all sentient beings? Or, “all is impermanent.” What is ‘all’? This morning I would like to learn [these] term[s] with you. 

##### 1:54

In Buddha's time, Buddha always analyzed the human world and human beings as five skandhas: form, feeling, perceptions, impulses and consciousness; those are the five skandhas. And also, sometimes, when the five skandhas are described in a little more detail, at that time the world is analyzed by six [sense] organs, six [sense] objects and six consciousness. 

So, six sense organs, six objects, and six consciousness, are the world we are involved [in]. So from this point, the five skandhas are exactly the implication of the term ‘all’; or ‘all sentient beings’, or ‘all dharmas’. 

Professor Abe translated it sometimes [as], "everything without exception". At any rate, ‘all’; if we translate it, we say ‘all’. But this all, according to Buddha’s teaching, is described as five skandhas, or six sense organs or six objects. 

You know [them] pretty well [so] I don't want to explain the five skandhas now, but let me say just the five things. 

Form: generally speaking that is the implication of the human world in the materialistical point of view. The human world you can see, you can touch; this is form. Everything exists as that which is formed; without form, you cannot experience. 

So everything which is formed is called state of existence, state of a thing which exists now. So when something appears in front of you, this is called existence, existence of a thing. But this existence of a thing must be something which you have to experience. So, when you have to experience, that is, you can experience something - form, shape, or color, and textures of a thing. Floor – if you touch it, you can experience something. 

So existence of a thing is not something fixed, apart from us. When you say, “floor is something existent,” at that time floor is not something apart from us, because it is always manifesting itself as a state of being. State of being is, well, you can experience through it. State of experience is always giving us some information, which is called colors, textures, shape, et cetera.

So when you experience floor as it is, at that time the floor becomes a state of being which you can touch with your hands, with your body, with your eyes, et cetera. At that time you say, “floor is smooth,” “floor is beautiful,” “floor is rough,” et cetera. You can say so. 

At that time you can really accept [the] existence of [the] floor. That floor is not something apart from us; it's really [a] state of existence as a floor *connected with* us. That's why you have to touch it. You can experience it with your hand, and then you can experience what the floor is. At that time, that floor is not something isolated from you. It is sort of a state of being interconnected with you, dynamically, from moment to moment. That is [what] we call state of being, which is called existence, according to Buddhism.

Feeling: Feeling means ... reception. We translate it as ‘feeling’, but according to Chinese and Sanskrit, I don't know if ‘feeling’ has exactly the right meaning.  According to Chinese and Sanskrit that is ‘reception’, ‘acceptance’. That is the second one. So form, and reception or feeling. 

Next is perception. Perception, you can receive something through the consciousness. But feeling is more basic, before you can get something through the consciousness, you can receive. That means connection with floor. And then, next moment, you can receive, perceive floor through six consciousnesses. So that is the third. Is that clear? Second one, feeling, is before your consciousness works; that is feeling or reception. Without this we cannot experience function of the perception. 

And fourth, impulses. Later I will explain this. Perception, or sometimes we call volition, or will. It's a very complicated term; it's very difficult to find appropriate term. But Conze says that is "together-maker". Anyway basically there something to make something together. I don't know what it is *[he laughs]*. That is called samskara. 

That is impulses, and then consciousness. If you perceive something, and then, on the bottom of your consciousness, on the bottom of your life, there is some powers, energies, to collect and make something, form your experience through the perception and feeling. And then immediately then next is called consciousness, that is consciousness. 

So impulses is sort of the basic nature of consciousness. 

##### 12:39

So this is the implication of 'all dharmas' or 'all'. But in Buddhism – you should remember this point – the 'all' is not something which exists separately from you. In other words, 'all' is not something which you can set out, something existent in advance.

For instance, if you look at the floor, immediately we believe, before I see the floor, the floor exists. So immediately we believe the floor is something which exists in advance. So already there is some function of consciousness, setting up something which is existent in advance. Is that clear?

That is not 'all'. 

'All' in Buddhism is ... the whole factors, which individual being is structured. So the 'all' is not something existent separate from the individual life – my, Katagiri's, my, I. So all beings come into existence when I involve form. At that time, form becomes one with all dharmas. From this point, my being, the all is the all for my being. Not something which I can set up a certain idea of something existent in advance, before I experience floor. It is not that 'all'. The 'all' is the factors which *my* being are structured. It means, floor and I are connected.

So, only when my beings are observed, floor, and make it in question. In other words, floor becomes called in question by my observation of floor. At that time, floor appears in this world, as all beings, as all dharmas. Is that clear?

For instance, if you cannot observe, and you cannot call it in question. For instance, the tiny insect in the Amazon. Well, I don't know. I can observe now, and tiny insect is completely not called into question; it is completely out of my question. So at that time, it doesn't become all dharmas. So when you use all dharmas, all sentient beings, at that time, first point is, that it must be observed and is called in question. At that time, it is called all dharmas, or all sentient beings. 

This is the first meaning of 'all dharmas'.

19:05

So from this point, we can think through the six consciousnesses. Even though you don't know a certain tiny insect in the amazon, sometimes you can think, or you can think of the possibility of such a tiny insect to exist. And also you can see it through the TV programs, etc. At that time, it is still 'all dharmas', which is observed is called in question. 

At that time, not only the insect and the birds and pebbles, trees, but still past, present and future, also are all dharmas, all sentient beings. Because you can observe as your object, and also you can make it question, what it is. So science fiction, or Mars, or the unusual beings on Mars or on other planets – as long as you can think of it, whatever it is – all are sentient beings. 

Only when you can observe it and make it a question, at that time, the creatures in Mars on other planets are all beings. But when they are not observed and not called into question, at that time they are completely out of question, it's not all beings. This is all beings. 

So if you say "I save all sentient beings," that 'all sentient beings' are what? The heavens, the human beings after death, anyway, this is all sentient beings are something related with you and thinking, observing and researching what it is at that time; that is all sentient beings.

So from this point, "I save all sentient beings" is what? Well, look around your life. How many beings exist? So around you there are questions, floor. Those things from this, those beings, we can help, one by one. We can handle your boots, and sandals, and your hair, and clothes. You can take care of them very much, pretty well. This is exactly to save all sentient beings. Because, sandals, your boots, your clothes are beings, all dharmas, which are observed, which are called into question. So, we should do it. At that time, it's not necessary to think something else which is not observed, and not called in question. From moment to moment, always there is some beings appears. 

That is first point.

23:32

Second point is, if all beings are something which we should connect with, we should involve, at that time, that is call 'all being' or 'all dharmas'. If it is true, we say 'truth'.

What is the truth? If truth is one of the dharmas, one of the human world, at that time, what is a dharma? Dharma is all dharmas which are observed and called in question. 

So truth is all beings, just free. Because you have to involve. 

So when you involve the truth, truth becomes dharma. That means, truth is something which you can experience individually. Without individual experience, truth is never ... ???  So truth must be something you should experience individually. At that time, this is called 'all dharmas'.

That's why there is a problem. Question is, truth is one, but individually if you experience a truth, truth appears in a different way. Do you think so? 

And finally we fight each other. "Your understanding of truth is wrong," or, "My understanding of truth is right, so you should believe me." You should believe this religion - we fight always.

Second point is, what is the limitation of the dhatu – dhatu is 'world' – which we can reach? What is the limitation of the world? 

In other words: how far does 'all dharmas' can extend? Is that clear? From where, to where? 

This is very important, second point is very important, because Buddha analyzed human world as six objects, and six sense organs. That means subject and object, briefly speaking – implication of subject and object. And subject and object are always interconnected. And through only human recognition, at that time your object becomes all dharmas. 

But recognition doesn't appear always in the same pattern. From moment to moment, recognition appears in a different way. So you cannot say the six objects and six sense organs are something existent as a fixed being. I don't think so. Because they become all dharmas only when you can recognize through the consciousness. So we need function of cognition. But unfortunately cognition doesn't apear in the same patterns; always different. 

So, how cognition appears in the different way. So when you see this zendo, first experience is, this zendo becomes all dharmas only when it is observed and called into question, at that time, it becomes all dharmas, called zendo, related with you. But that is your understanding, your individual experience. If you always handle zendo according to this point, it is not the best way to exist in peace and harmony. Because everyone creates different dharmas. 

So point is, how much, how far does the all dharmas extend. That means, not dharmas shouldn't extend only to individual, to everyone. And also, to not understanding on the surface, to understanding deeply. Depth of beings. The dharma should penetrate to this. 

So from this point, if you see this zendo, first zendo becomes dharma through your connection. At that time it becomes dharma. But this zendo is not usual zendo which you have understood; this dharma must be dharma which is universal, extending to the depth of beings. From this point, this dharma, what is the original nature of beings, called as zendo? 

That means, what is the zendo?

Zendo is not zendo you understand. Zendo is just a being. What is just a being? Just a being is what is called samskara in Sanskrit. Samskara means original nature of action. The Buddha says, all are impermanent. In Japanese, in Sanskrit, what we say, not all. Literally translation is "all samskaras". Samskara means original nature of action, working. The original nature of action is impermanence. Impermanence means not perpetual. Impermanence means not perpetual, but at any time, in whatever situation you may be, everything is not perpetual. Everything is not constant. But, if you say everything is not perpetual, not permanent, you say what is what everything is not permanent is something real. In other words, something real which exists, always. Don't you think so?

So if you want to get something existent always, without change, that is called impermanence. Not something perpetual. But at that time, this idea is not impermanent. If you believe, Buddhism says, truth is the reality which everything is impermanent. If you say, immediately we get some idea what everything is impermanent is true. Which exists always, in all the times. But this always, in all the tines, is not perpetual, is not something impermanent. It is a certain state of being at any time, in whatever situation you may be. My situation, your situation. 

For instance, if I see this zendo, this is my situation. If you see zazen, this is my situation. At any time, anywhere, if you see zazen, this is all beings, which is always there. But this zazen is always not perpetual, always changing. 

But zazen which is not perpetual is something real which exists, you believe. But this is – what? Something which exists always or in any time, in all the time, means, a state of being which you can experience any time, wherever you may be. In your time, in your situation. So if I see zazen, this is today, I see zazen today, I feel good. This is my dharma, all dharmas, which is called zazen. Next day, next moment, if I see zazen, this is I don't feel good. For zazen, this is also dharmas. 

So in your individual case, whatever you experience, whatever you see, this things becomes all dharmas, this all dharmas are always changing, impermanent. 

Second point, briefly speaking: We have to understand deeply the original nature of being. That's why Buddha says, always impermanent. This all is all samskaras. Samskara is original nature of action, which everything is structured by. Constant action, working. 

At that time, if you understand zendo individually, this is not good enough. This is your experience, your understanding, which is called dharma. But it's not good enough because there is still an egoistic sense, which is called individual understanding. But we have to find the vast dimension, which is immensity, or equality. This is called basic nature of action; samskara. 

According to samskara, everything is impermanent. It is really true. Original nature of action is nothing but action. Nothing to hold on... If you put a certain label on action, called action, it is already idea. Action is always action. Nothing to stop. 

39:16

From this point, we should understand all beings through individual experience. That is five skandhas, and six consciousnesses, six sense organs, six objects. A that time, unfortunately, cognition always appears in a different way, because basic nature of human being is always working constantly, nothing to stop. From where that cognition comes? That cognition comes from basic nature of action, which is called samskara. That's why finally, you have to throw it away. You have to polish your individual understanding until it becomes universal. Until you can touch the core of existence. At that time, it really becomes all dharmas. We call [it] all sentient beings.

So if you want to save all sentient beings, first you have experience many things from your individual experience. So you, carrying your karmas, your heredity, your knowledge, you have to experience. But it is not good enough. Anyway you have to sink into the depths of the ocean, until you can touch the core of existence. At that time, it becomes really dharma, all dharmas. If you want to save all sentient beings, first handle human beings, or any beings around you. Anyway, help. Experience, think carefully, and help, mutually help, in order to live in peace and harmony. But still there is a question, problems. That's why individually, we have to practice on a daily basis, in order to touch the core of existence. 

42:00

To experience the original nature of action is not something... of course you can see it as object. But it is not something you can see objectively, because it is already you are body and mind are nothing but original being of action, which is called samskaras. From this point, well, you just accept. Just accept means not try to get, not try to learn. Before you try to learn, you are learned. You are learned means you are helped, you are supported. Something makes it possible for your likfe ot be present or to exist. 

For instance, if I ask you to talk, first you try to study something. This is very important. Through your effort of studying a certain subject, you can learn something. But this is not good enough. So secondly, when you finish the preparation, just talk. Just talk means not object you can experience individually. Completely you are supported by talk, already. In other words, you are talked by talk. Not you teach. This is very true, don't you think so? 

If you talk, there's two ways. Always we have to research, because al dharmas must be individual connections. At that time, everything becomes all dharmas. But simultaneously you have to touch the core of beings means, just be one with. Because just be one means touch the core of existence, which is called actions. Basically everything is moving, constantly. If it is true, impermanence is not something you can see objectively, because your body and mind are already impermanent. So be one with. even whether you understand it or not, your body is already impermanent, always. So what is that? You should learn first, individually, simultaneously, just take care of your life. Then, something makes you learn what human life is. In other words, be one with impermanence. 

When you want to swim in Lake Calhoun, well, learn how to swim. It's very important. At that time, Lake Calhoun is something observed and which is called in question. And then this is your dharmas, all dharmas. And next, all dharmas are not always something you can experience, you can observe individually. Forget it. Just jump into the ocean. The ocean helps your life. And Lake Calhoun's waters helps you life. And immediately your body moves, simultaneously. And then you learn: "Oh, this is the point. I can swim." How to swim. Yes it is. 

If you think always all dharmas objectively, individually, it someties scares you. WIth your effort you should learn it. But when the time comes, you just dive.

*[tape change]*

... when you can get something from the ocean, at that time, that is a point, how to swim. This point doesn't come from your intentional understanding, or individual understanding. From where, I don't know. Just oneness with ocean, and your body and mind. And then you say, "Ah, this is a way how to swim." You cannot explain how. If you want to teach how to swim, you should explain. So finally you say, jump in. Go to Lake Calhoun. Swim. That's all. 

That is the second point, of all dharmas. You should experience all dharmas individually. At that time, everything becomes all dharmas connected with you. But it's not good enough, because there is always egoistic sense. So we should touch the core of all dharmas. That means, forget it – just jump into it. Be one. The same applies to zazen. Learn zazen – what is zazen? Well, philosophically, psychologically, you can learn. But it's not good enough! So just jump in. Jump [into] zazen. So finally, zazen teaches you. Zazen takes care of you. "Oh, pretty good." Sometimes I think it's not good, but ... you feel good. You don't know what it is, but if you jump in, more or less, you can touch the core of zazen, which is called samskara. Samskara is impermanence, constantly working. That's why this is the confluence of all dharmas in Buddhism. All dharmas is not the world after death, which is completely transcending individual experience. Of course, when it is observed and is called in question, it becomes dharma. Even the world after death becomes dharma. But I don't think so. 

50:10

Because it is completely beyond individual experience. It's pretty hard to ... that's why Buddha kept silent about this problem. So, all dharmas must be something, which becomes and individual experience. And then next, we should touch the depths of existence, which is called samskara. That means practically, jump into it. And then very naturally, you can learn something more than your effort. This is the ... samskara, together maker, or original nature of action. 

51:20

Whatever you do, this is a very important way of life. Not only zazen. Without this, you cannot learn anything. 

Do you have some questions?

51:38

**Question**: Roshi? Isn't it disturbing though that even though one has ... of impermanence one keeps having the feeling of 'I'.

**Katagiri**: Sure. Yes. 

If you feel some pessimistic from impermanence etc. as a teaching, that is the impermanence you can observe objectively. While you observe it objectively, it makes you pensive and sometimes egoistic. This is because this is individual experience. If you read the Japanese literature, always there are stories based on impermanence. That's all the Japanese literature. certain ... not possums exactly, sort of pensive, sad feeling. But this is individual experience. For Buddhism it's not good enough. Of course you should individually experience, but impermanence must be Buddha. That's why we have to understand basic nature of existence. 

Completely speaking, if you feel your life from ... the kitchen of Buddha, which is called impermanence, you don't believe, and you try to keep away from, because you don't like it. But actually reality is impermanence, always changing constantly. It is reality. But if you see it objectively, it's immediately given something beautiful. But on the other hand, it is reality. So important point is, where are you? You are in the middle of reality. In other words, right in the middle of impermanence. 

Whatever you feel individually, that's understanding. Let's touch the core of existence, which is called real impermanence. Real impermanence is something you should be one with it. That's why basically, I always tell you, just take care of your life. 

Whatever you feel, good or bad, right or wrong, stand up straight, do your best to handle your obligation, your duties and task – anyway, just do it. That is what puts you right in the middle of impermanence. So very naturally you can learn, just like diving into the ocean. Whatever you feel, like or dislike, just jump into the ocean. And very naturally, you can learn something. How to swim, what is the ocean, what is the human body and mind. Very naturally you can learn. 

Does that answer your question?

**Same person**: Do you mean that depending on the depth of your understanding, your feeling of the 'I' is more or less there?

**Katagiri**: Something more than that. More than six consciousness, eyes, ears, nose, et cetera. But without six consciousness, you cannot experience, you cannot understand the original nature of existence. That's why we have to experience individually. But it is not good enough; still we have to understand the basic nature, what is individual experience?

**Same person**: That's not what I mean. I mean, what does the feeling of 'I' come from? It doesn't come from the six consciousnesses.

**Katagiri**: Well, of course, six consciousnesses, and also it comes from ignorance according to twelvefold chain of causation. Plainly speaking, it comes from the function of consciousness. Consciousness already immediately separates, analyzes, and gets it immediately. That is individual feeling, individual understanding. Without this, we cannot exist. 

So that's why everything becomes observed and called in question. Whatever it is. By [inspection?], anyway being, all dharmas. Even though you don't believe. Because you can think it, you can observe. That's why many years ago, someone wrote science fiction, maybe recently, one by one, it comes to be true. You can go to the Moon. I have never thought when I was a child; it was impossible for me to go to the moon. But now, you can go to the moon. And we can know Mars and other planets. And you can see the very interesting stories on the TV, well, relations with human beings and creatures on another planet. It's possible. 

58:45

**Question**: Roshi? I'm not sure what you mean when you say "call in question." 

**Katagiri**: Called in question means it becomes in question. Thinking, what it is. If you see this tatami: tatami becomes something existent, which you can ... see as object. Thinking and acting, what is it? That is calls in question. Is that okay?

58:24

**Question**: Roshi? Is the word ??? save all sentient beings?

**Katagiri**: That is exactly the same as 'all'. 

**Same person**: Is it necessary ... ????

**Katagiri**: When you say 'all', when you use 'all', it is limited not by all living beings. Including animate or inanimate beings. Temporarily we say all sentient beings, but in the Chinese term, it is not limited by all living beings. All beings. 

**Same person**: Is that kind of a translation...

**Katagiri**: I don't know...

*[some chuckles]*

**Same person**: My understanding of the word sentient refers to living beings. And so sentient beings ... it wouldn't have occurred to me to think of my hair or the floor. Can you explain ... jus asking for a better understanding. 

**Another person**: I think the Buddhist interpretation of living and sentient is different from the American one. To us, a rock isn't a living being, but to Buddhist point of view, a rock ...

**Katagiri**: I don't know what's the difference between all sentient beings and all living beings. It's completely different?

**Another person**: No, that's the same. But you're talking about non-living things.

**Katagiri**: Oh. Non-living beings.

**Another person**: Rocks are living beings, they're not non-living. 

**Katagiri**: Not-living beings means, according to human consciousness, it doesn't have a brains and thinking, consciousness, that's why we temporarily analyze, distinguish: it is not all living beings. But actually it is living.

**Another person**: ....

**Katagiri**: Everything is alive, that's why we have to take care of. But in a sense, in other words, the thinking, the image, you can think. This is also a sort of, funny being. I don't know how to call it. Living beings or not living beings – but anyway living beings, because you can think. But when you save living, a being becomes connected with you. At that time it becomes living. But if you see it objectively, whatever it is, it becomes dead.

*[laughter]*

It's not 'all beings'. In order to accept all beings, it must be something involved. At that time, everything becomes living. 

Is that okay?

*[laughter]*

Any others?

*Question*: Hojo, can you say that truth is the same as one of the dharmas ... truth has to be experienced individually. 

**Katagiri**: Mmm-hmm. While you are thinking of the truth, it is nothing but all beings, which is impermanence. But truth is one – when you say truth is one, truth is something which exists, completely beyond human speculation. That means truth is original state of being. 

So, it must be something we should experience, that is the truth. But real truth is not individual experience. Still something, real meaning of truth, we have to understand.

**Question**: Would you please explain ... 

**Katagiri**: Distinguishing mind is permanent? Oh. *[laughter]*

Let me think about that... *[laughter]*

That's why Zen is very tricky... *[laughter]*

Zen is not honest! *[laughter]*

Zen is always teaching you human life in a crooked way. *[laughter]*

The other aspect of the truth, distinguish mind is something perverted. The other aspect distinguished mind is truth.

Well... never mind. 

*[hysterical laughter]*

You understand, okay? 

Well, distinguished mind, without distinguished mind, you cannot experience the truth, or Buddha Nature, whatever it is. From this point, it is very important for us. So, open your eyes, to take care of ... with mind as something permanent. You cannot destroy.

On the other hand, if you touch it... If you are completely involved too much, it becomes some trouble. 

**Question**: ??? would you repeat that statement please?

Person: The distinguishing mind ... 

**Katagiri**: That is completely opposite, okay? Usually we hate distinguishing mind, and we like truth very much. This is the human desire. That's why you want to practice. But that is individual understanding. When you see dharma individual point of view. But it is not real dharma. Real dharma is deeper, like ocean. So ... eyes open to see another aspect. That's why he said opposite. 

For instane, Zen always says, the first koan the Zen master gives you is nothing. Nothing is completely something you are amazed, because we don't believe in that way. Everything exists, everything is real. But zen says, nothing. Think this. That is really big shock. 

That big shock is very important. It isn't important whether you understand it or not, Zen teacher doesn't expect you in that way. Just to give you big shock, like this. You cannot destroy the question ... question becomes ... nothing. That big shock is rooted in your mind. That's very nice.
