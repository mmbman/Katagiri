In the *Lotus Sutra*, Chapter 25, it says:

> If there by countless hundred thousand million ... of living beings suffering from pain and distress who hear of this Bodhisattva Regarder of the Cries of the World, and with all their mind call upon his name, the Bodhisattva Regarder of the Cries of the World will instantly regard their cries, and of them will be delivered. 

This is Buddha’s answer to the question made by the Bodhisattva named Infinite Bodhisattva in this chapter. The discussion goes between Buddha and Bodhisattva named Infinite. This is very interesting point, because the discussion goes between the Buddha and a Bodhisattva named Infinite, about Avalokiteshvara, which is the symbol of compassion. In English, Avalokitshvara here it says is Regarder of the Cries of the World. But I want to say this is Cries regarding the human world. When you see very closely the human world, the human mind, very naturally a very deep sound – not a cry; cries means a very deep sound, a voice. It’s kind of a voice, but it’s voiceless. A voiceless voice is there, in the bottom of the human heart. Whatever you may be, whatever you experience, so whatever you have, whatever lifestyle you follow, everywhere – if you are right there, immediately you can see, even though you cannot see, you are present right in the middle of very deep sound. You cannot evaluate it at a certain price – so called “it is good,” or “it is sad,” or “it is pleased mind,” or pleased feeling, or unpleased feeling. You cannot evaluate it at a certain prize. So that is, you are there, whatever kind of situation you may be in. Always. Right in the middle of success, right in the middle of failure, right in the middle of good person, right in the middle of nothing. Whatever you do, you can see. You are there. Even if you don’t see it, you’re life still cries. 

This is named Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, the Cries of Regarding the World and human life. That is all of us, not the bodhisattva or particular person whom Buddhism emphasizes. All of us. You are Avalokiteshvara. So very naturally, everyone is present right in the middle of that situation, that’s why you can learn many things, about good, about bad, about neutral, about suffering, about pleasant feeling, about unpleasant feeling. Emptiness, compassion, kindess – you can really learn. 

This conversation goes between the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara and the Bodhisattva Infinite. A
