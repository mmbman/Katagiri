**Katagiri Roshi:** Page 36. Yesterday, I mentioned in *chosan* that I would like to [explain] a little more about the statement, “The mind as phenomena (*samsara*) is grounded on the *tathagatagarbha*.”
 
I think most people have big doubt how the truth relates with the samsaric world. [It is] very difficult to figure out the relationship, how truth comes into the samsaric world. What is the subject which *samsara* is produced? How [the] samsaric world is produced? It’s very difficult to understand. But we want to know.

For me, for many, many years, I really wanted to fill up that gap between the truth and the samsaric world. Because that is a most interesting point for me. But practically speaking, I think even if you understand intellectually, it doesn't work actually. Practically speaking, all you have to do is to take care of everyday life with wholeheartedness. That's all we have to do. 

So, [practicing simply]. But still the intellectual sense [isn't satisfied], so actual practice becomes a little bit shaky. We don't understand *why* we have to practice [in this] simple way; why we have to do *gassho*, why we have to do the daily routine [of everyday life]. Why is it that [...] we have to take care of daily routine? Because it is important. [But] we don't understand this. 

But no matter how long we try to explain this... well, it’s very difficult for me to explain, because most people don't experience what the truth is, and they don't experience strongly from daily routine how important it is. So it’s pretty hard. So very naturally, teachers and ancestors a *little bit* force you to do [it]: [saying,] “Even though you don't understand it, please follow the ancestors' suggestions” – [like this]. 

For instance, if you want to be a barber in a barber shop, you have to follow the teacher's way. Because you have never experienced [that]; so, you should just follow the teacher's way. And then, you become a barber. But, if we do it in that way, it is fine in a sense, but it is not fine in a sense, because your practice doesn’t satisfy [you] with your life. Lots of questions come up. 

That's why, very naturally, this kind of book is established. So today [...] I would like to [talk] about this. 

#### 05:18

Yesterday I mentioned the *tathagatagarbha* is not the same as the truth itself. The truth is exactly truth. I think we have learned [this] before... look at page 32, “The Mind in Terms of the Absolute”. [...] This section explains the absolute. You should understand the truth like this. 

The first line:

> The mind in terms of the absolute is the one world of reality and the essence of all phases of existence in their totality.

What does it mean? This means... look at page 33, the fourth line from the bottom of the first paragraph. It says:

> ... nor is there anything which needs to be pointed out as real, for all things are equally in the
state of suchness. It should be understood that all things are incapable of being verbally explained or thought of; hence, the name suchness.

So, the first point is that the truth is the one world of reality – exactly one world of reality – and the essence of all phases of existence in their totality. That means [there is] no need to point out what is the truth, or no need to explain what the truth is, because [it is] always there. So, no need [for it] to be pointed out as real or [as not] real. It’s not necessary, because it’s always there. 

That means [the] absolute is omnipresent as one, one world. And that means you can see this one world. But it’s very difficult to see this one world, so-called truth. 

If so, how can we see the one world as the truth? That is the truth manifested in everything. [That] means the truth dwelling in all sentient beings. That's why here it says it’s not necessary for all things to be pointed out as real, because all things are equally in the state of suchness. Because one world as truth is omnipresent. *Omnipresent* means you can see the truth in everything; you are in contact with table, book, whatever it is. That is the meaning of *omnipresent*. 

You should remember this, okay? That is the first point. 

The second point is, the truth is... look at the page 32, the third line from the bottom:

> That which is called “the essential nature of the Mind” is unborn and is imperishable. 

And then later, this characteristic of the absolute will be explained in many ways, from different angles: it's not one, it's not different, et cetera... it's not long, it's not wide... anyway, they explain it here in page 33. 

Anyway, the characteristic of the truth is something unborn. “The world was born and then the truth comes,” or “somebody was born in this world and then he brings that truth into the human world” – I don't think this is the truth. Even [if there is] nothing in this world, truth is truth, always. 

So, it's not something coming from one place to another, two minutes ago or two minutes later. No. That is called *not born*. So [it’s] completely beyond born or unborn. It's always there. Because that is [one], it’s not necessary to be pointed out as real. 

And *imperishable* means completely regardless of whether you believe in or not, or if you try to take it away or you try to hold on. Nothing to do; [whether] you believe or not, it's there, constantly. Or it is not something you can throw away. Or it is not something you can participate in *from now*. Or it is not something from which you can escape, or which you can get into now. No. 

So, this is the truth. This is called *unborn* and *imperishable*; this is the characteristic of the truth. 

That's why it's pretty hard to know. But this is called *one mind* sometimes, because it's very simple. Because everyone, all sentient beings, exist just like this, on the basis of this absolute truth. That's why we say *one mind*. *One mind* means completely beyond your speculations, before you think it, there is one world. 

So, that is the truth. But if it is very difficult to know that one world, is there no way to know? Yes, there is. That is the truth manifested in everyday life: human beings, birds, nature... *gassho*, and having a meal, getting up in the morning, daily routine... whatever you do, always there is the truth. 

And that's why here it [says it] like this. So you should remember this. 

So, from this point – do you believe that this kind of truth can create the samsaric world? 

In other words, by the activity of this truth, absolute truth, do you believe the samsaric world is produced, or created? 

No. Because absolute truth has nothing to do. It doesn’t do anything. Just be there. Because it is unborn, imperishable. Nothing. 

That’s why... I forget the Western philosopher’s name... Kierkegaard? *[The students pronounce ‘Kierkegaard’, and he laughs.]* Yes. He says, “No God.” “No God” doesn’t mean to destroy or ignore God. He knows [what] real God is. That’s nothing. Buddha doesn’t do anything. But Buddha is constantly there. 

So, that’s why if we say “no God,” we are really [mad] at this philosopher, but I don’t think it’s negative. And [that the] absolute is nothing to do for *you*, that doesn’t mean ignoring your existence. That means, completely beyond your speculation, the absolute is always with you. [It is with you] before you think, “the absolute creates *samsara*” – that is already speculation! Or, “the absolute is with me now” – that is also speculation. But before you say any words like this, “absolute with me now,” it is already words. The absolute is already with you, constantly. So that’s why *unborn*, *imperishable*. 

So from this point, it’s impossible for us to understand, even philosophically, that the absolute creates *samsara*. No. The absolute is very quiet, dynamical, omnipresent – but it doesn’t do anything, just be there. Maintaining it’s own life. Just maintaining. 

That is *the truth*. If so, you cannot say “truth creates *samsara*”. Some Buddhist scholars understood that the samsaric world is created by the activity of the absolute truth. But that is a little bit of a misunderstanding. 

If so, that’s why this discourse finds out another category so-called *tathagatagarbha*. 

#### 19:26

The *tathagatagarbha* is a very interesting teaching. In terms of general Buddhism, this idea is very important. If you understand the idea of *tathagatagarbha*, I think you can taste a little bit the meaning of *Shōbōgenzō*, the meaning of *time-being* mentioned by Dōgen, et cetera. You can see a little bit. That’s why this discourse brings up another term, so-called *tathagatagarbha*.

*Tathagatagarbha* is the truth dwelling in... us, and all beings. [It is not the] abstracted idea of the principle or action – no. *Tathagatagarbha* is the real, very important ground of life. It is not an abstract idea.

You should remember this: Buddhism doesn’t investigate *process* – the process of how truth comes to [or] joins the *samsara*, or *samsara* joins to the truth. Not *process* of. That is philosophy. Intellectually we say, if you move from A to B, what is the A, what is the B? And then how can you move to B? Et cetera. This is our understanding, intellectual *[unintelligible]*. But Buddhism doesn’t explain *anything* in that way. Buddhism accepts [...] real reality as it is, right now, right here. In other words, we have to see the interacting relations among the many conditions in terms of the reality as it is, which is constantly arising. Not the process of how to arise, how to move. 

So, Buddhism, anyway, jumps into the reality as it is, and then, learns how it is structured. 

That’s why daily routine is very important. In terms of our sense of human body, daily routine is a small detail for us, but daily routine is not so different from a professional job you have. *[Unintelligible]* is not different from Himalayan mountains. So I think that you have to understand the practice in reality as it is, instead of a certain investigative process of how to create [these practices]. Why? The reason why it is so small, in comparison with the Himalayan mountain, et cetera – this is our intellectual system. But that is a philosophy: you can build up big mansions, so-called philosophy, psychology, etc. But Buddhism always participates directly first, reality as it is. And *then* research, investigate, understand the structure of that reality, among the many conditions. Because there are many conditions there. Cause, secondary cause, first cause – many, many conditions. So that is always the Buddhistic attitude. 

So from this attitude this term comes up, so-called *tathagatagarbha*. Because if you look at yourself, you cannot analyze your reality, from where it comes, what kind of characteristics you have. You cannot judge yourself on the basis of one-sided ideas, so-called “good boy” or “bad boy”. You cannot do it. So if you look at yourself in reality as it is, I think you have always two things: the samsaric world, and also something more than the samsaric world. 

The samsaric world is suffering, but more than suffering. There is some important thing, more than the samsaric world you really hate. Because no matter how long you hate it or you try to escape, still your existence goes on and on, wherever you may go. So, what do you mean? In terms of the samsaric world, are you judged as a bad boy? If so, is that it? That is your life? No. Even though in terms of the samsaric world someone judges your life as bad, still you can survive, you can go *any* place. Your life goes on and on. If so, there is something in your life more than a sense of judgment, evaluation; more than the samsaric world. That is called *truth itself* – truth which is found in life. 

But this truth, if found in your life, is not *actual* truth. This is *your* truth. This is the truth you can find in your life. 

The problem is that people believe that truth dwelling in individual life *is* real truth, as one-world. That’s why we fight, you know? [If] you find the truth in your life, that [is a] limited understanding of truth, through your life. 

So you should still take lots of time to refine this understanding of the truth found in your life. Philosophically, psychologically, religiously – whatever it is – you have to find it and polish and refine it, until it becomes one world. Until you become living in peace and harmony with all sentient beings, you should continually refine the understanding of the truth, understanding of the universe. 

But usually people always believe that understanding of the universe or the truth, which seems to be the truth. But it’s not! If you [believe that], it becomes a cause of problems. That’s why in the human world [we are] always fighting. 

And also you can find the truth in others’ life, too. You can find the truth in the tables, you can find the truth in nature. [...] 

So, that truth is called *tathagatagarbha* because that truth is found in everything, and simultaneously it is limited by individual life. That’s why the truth [is] veiled in delusion – we say so. That is called *tathagatagarbha*. 

That *tathagatagarbha* is your life in reality as it is. If you look at your life directly.

#### 30:22

So far we have questions about the *tathagatagarbha*. [Do] you know the difference between truth itself and *tathagatagarbha*? Do you have a question? 

**Question:** *[Unintelligible]* not *tathagatagarbha* but the truth as phenomenal world, it sounds so dualistic: the absolute is not *samsara*, ...

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yeah, it’s not dualistic, so I have to explain the next [part], the so-called *harmony* – the harmony and peace. In this book, [...] on page 36 it says, “diffuses harmoniously with birth and death.” So I asked you the other day the meaning of “diffusing harmoniously with”? In the original text it used the word *peace*, or *harmony*, but this translation says it like this. So I have to explain that peace and harmony, okay? 

Are there any questions? 

**Question:** I still don’t understand how the samsaric world comes from the absolute truth, which doesn’t do anything but maintain itself.

**Katagiri Roshi:** Maintain itself, and also [is] omnipresent. Omnipresent is everywhere. That is “maintain constantly”. Okay?

**Question:** Can you say the samsaric world does not *[unintelligible]*...

**Katagiri Roshi:** No. Does not. 

**Same person:** Then where does it come from?

**Katagiri Roshi:** That’s why, if we want to know what is the subject which *samsara* is produced, that is “what is the subject?” That subject is so-called *tathagatagarbha*. 

**Same person:** *[Unintelligible.]*

**Katagiri Roshi:** Not “comes from”. *[He laughs.]* But if you say so, yes, it comes from *tathagatagarbha*.

I explained [why we] use *tathagatagarbha*. What is the Buddhist attitude? Do you understand this one? You always question, “somebody created this one,” or “this one comes from this somebody.” This is [very delusive], alright? This is very philosophical. If you research something, you never understand religious life – because that is your discriminating mind, [et cetera]. No, you don’t understand. But you should pay careful attention to something *more than that*. What is it? What do you have to pay attention to? 

**Question:** The *samsara* and [...] are ignorance... 

**Katagiri Roshi:** No, that is another subject. I am talking about in order to understand the human world in the relation between the *samsara* and truth, what kind of attitude you should take toward human life. How should you investigate? I told you.

**Same person:** ... through the manifestation of *tathagatagarbha* in your...

**Katagiri Roshi:** It’s [not] where *tathagatagarbha* comes up [or] how, why, the *tathagatagarbha* comes up. The *tathagatagarbha* is created through the Buddhistic attitude towards human life, which is quite different from the usual philosophy. Do you understand? I told you, anyway, a few minutes ago... *[Some laughter.]*

**Someone:** *[Unintelligible.]*

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yes, yes, there is. *Structurally*, that’s true. 

**Someone:** *[Unintelligible.]*

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yes, that’s pretty close. Yes, that’s true.

**Someone:* You said just to do it. Just jump in and ...

**Katagiri Roshi:** That is the practice, actual practice. You have to do it. 

**Someone:** *[Unintelligible.]*

**Katagiri Roshi:** Mm-hmm. 

**Someone:** *[Unintelligible.]*

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yeah. What is that? [...] Where is it?

**Someone:** *[Unintelligible.]*

**Katagiri Roshi:** No... after “covered with delusion” is where? Yesterday? Tomorrow? 

**Someone:** Right here, right now. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Right here. Right here means what? [...] The reality-as-it-is. Do you understand this one? Reality. 

If you want to know who you are in the relation with the truth, do you want to research the process [of] how you come from the truth? This is intellectual. Okay? 

In other words, I am Katagiri. If you want to investigate, you have to research maybe from where Katagiri comes. So very naturally, you want to research my parents, ancestors, and [their] ancestors, again and again. You have to trace back to my ancestors, and then you believe, “yes, Katagiri comes from Katagiri’s ancestors.” Something like this. But, do you believe it hits to understanding of Katagiri who is alive now? *[He chuckles.]* Is it total understanding of Katagiri who is alive now? Of course, it is a *part* of understanding of Katagiri, but it’s not total. 

So, how do you research? 

**Someone:** ... you can exerience *[unintelligible]*

**Katagiri Roshi:** Sure ...  and then you have to accept this one as it is, in reality. Before you investigate, analyze, from where [...], what kind of character he has... those questions come up *later*. Do you understand? Because unconsciously or consciously, you accept [someone] as he is. 

**Someone:** I don’t understand then why we concern ourselves to [...] the truth, *[unintelligible]*. In other words, if I *[unintelligible]* culmination of learning *[unintelligible]*...
 
**Katagiri Roshi:** Because there is quite a different situation that comes up according to whether you realize the truth or not, even though truth is always with us. If you don’t realize... Let’s [imagine] two persons. This person realizes the truth; this person doesn’t realize. 

**Someone:** [What do you mean by] “realizing the truth”?

**Katagiri Roshi:** “Realizing” [means] get a taste of. 

**Someone:** [Not philsophical understanding...]

**Someone:** Philosophical understanding comes up later; after. After you can accept, you can digest and extrude... Realization is to digest... you know, understand the idea of the truth, philosophically, psychologically... and then it becomes energy. At that time it is called *realized*. Okay? That is realization. 

**Someone:** It seems like that has *[unintelligible]* which is concrete.

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yes, concrete. 

**Someone:** *[Inaudible.]*

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yes.

**Someone:** *[Inaudible.]* But when we talk about *truth*, that *[unintelligible]*.

**Katagiri Roshi:** Oh... as a principle, that is the absolute itself. It is the principal. So [it is] far from us. That is very metaphysical and philosophical. 

**Someone:** So is that why you wanted to use the word *tathagatagarbha* *[inaudible.]*

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yes. That’s why that absolute doesn’t create something in the samsaric world, because it is unborn and *[unintelligible]*. But the absolute is something omnipresent. Do you understand? *Omnipresent* means everywhere, so that’s why we can see that truth. That truth is not abstract. It’s very concrete. Do you understand? That’s why it is called *tathagatagarbha*. 

**Someone:** In Christianity, there was a whole *[unintelligible]* of God movement. Is that the god as an abstract entity, truth or whatever, and more of a... [...]  people like that talking about a ground of all beings. Is that the same as the notion of *tathagatagarbha*?

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yes, [of course,] but I don’t know exactly the traditional idea of God in Christianity. But Buddhism is not investigating, analyzing the truth itself. 

**Someone:** Yeah. *[Unintelligible.]*

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yes, because our lives are completely embraced by the truth. So, totally accept. 

And then if you totally accept, you have to look at yourself in reality as it is, exactly. So that is the first step: to know. 

**Someone:** *[Inaudible]* ... the manifestation in the concrete world. For example like flowers, water, the wood pattern, and that that is the *tathagatagarbha*?

**Katagiri Roshi:** It is.

**Someone:** ... but that is absolute truth manifesting in the concrete world. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yes. That is called *tathagatagarbha*. 

But absolute truth is manifested in the concrete aspect. *Concrete aspect* means, in this case, “veiled with delusion,” it says here. *Delusion* means discriminating mind. 

**Someone:** So, in a way, one should try and go beyond those patterns?

**Katagiri Roshi:** Sure. [You should] find the truth in your life manifested in various aspects, and then [...] you should go beyond. Because the real absolute is [going] beyond that truth you have found in ... 

*[Tape change.]*

... difficult to explain, that’s why we use words simply. That is “the truth”, so-called, or “one mind”, “one world”. Simple words. But if you understand the truth expressed in the words simply, as simple as you can, at that time, it is still limited. So that’s why through using the words in order to explain absolute truth, then you should go beyond the truth in words. 

**Someone:** Is that why they say, “the spiritual source shines clearly in the light”?

**Katagiri Roshi:** Sure, that’s true. 

**Someone:** [Then] *tathagatagarbha* is just kind of a skillful means? It seems to be that, a skillful means for us to ... 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Maybe so. Mm-hmm?

**Someone:** At the same time, [*tathagatagarbha*] is also covered with delusions.

**Katagiri Roshi:** Because? 

**Someone:** Well, it’s a word, concept. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** And that’s why you should understand *why*. Because...? 

**Someone:** There is always a gap between the samsaric world and the truth. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Oh no, I don’t think so. You should listen carefully. *[He laughs.]*

I say [*tathagatagarbha* is] *covered* with delusion, okay? *Tathagatagarbha* is the truth *covered with* delusion. Alright? But that delusion means what? What do we mean, delusion? 

**Someone:** Discriminating mind?

**Katagiri Roshi:** Discriminating mind. *Delusion* is called discriminating mind. 

Why do we call discriminating mind delusion? Why? 

**Someone:** *[Inaudible]*

**Katagiri Roshi:** Mm-hmm. Why?

**Someone:** *[Inaudible]*

**Katagiri Roshi:** Why?

**Someone:** *[Inaudible]*

**Katagiri Roshi:** Actually, what does the discriminating mind [do]? 

**Someone:** It’s dualistic.

**Katagiri Roshi:** Dualistic. Separated. 

If you separate the subject and object – if you dichotomize the word into two, subject and object – then do you believe you can live in peace? 

*[Pause. Laughter.]*

Strictly speaking, it’s pretty hard, anyway. 

**Someone:** But you still have to try!

**Katagiri Roshi:** *[Laughs.]* That’s why we need to practice, anyway. Because constantly discrimination is going, where you cannot create a peaceful and harmonious life – but nevertheless, right in the middle of that discriminating world, we have to create a peaceful life. Because we want [that]. [Or even if] you don’t want that, there is the truth. Very naturally, truth will take you to the peaceful world, or anyway to see this world. 

So very naturally you bump your head against the big pole, sooner or later. Alright? 

#### 50:00

So, *tathagatagarbha* is the truth covered with delusion. What do we mean? Why do we call it delusion? Concretely speaking, what kind of the truth? How do you find [it]? Where is it?

**Someone:** *[Inaudible.]*

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yeah! Personal. 

“Personal” means, if you see the truth in the personal life, is that truth real truth? 

**Someone:** Personal.

**Katagiri Roshi:** It’s pretty personal. If the truth is personal, it is not universal. So that is the limit of understanding of the truth. 

But usually we always believe the truth *you* have understood, or *you* have experienced. That’s why we create trouble, always. Because if there are ten people who understand the different way. Not the same, at all. So, very naturally, ten different kinds of the universe and truth come up. Then they fight. Alright? 

**Someone:** Hojo-san, you said the Buddhist attitude toward life creates the *tathagatagarbha*. Did you mean that the Buddhist attitude toward life creates the *concept* of the *tathagatagarbha*?

**Katagiri Roshi:** No, no, no, not *create*. The *tathagatagarbha*... very naturally comes into existence from the attitude towards human life in the Buddhistic way. Very naturally because Buddhists speak up. I always focus on the person or thing in reality as it is, instead of researching the process: how to create it, from where it comes, et cetera. Do you understand? 

So, always focus on *this*: one person or one thing in reality as it is. If so, how many things can be found in this one thing, one person? Can you judge this or that person exactly according to the one-sided idea, so-called truth, pure or not pure? Can you? 

**Someone:** You *can*...

**Katagiri Roshi:** You can’t. 

**Someone:** You can, but it’s not... 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Well, even though you can judge, “hey, Katagiri is good boy,” I don’t think it’s “good boy”. Don’t you think so? On the other hand, you cannot say either he is “bad boy”. Because this is the panoramic picture of reality, the panoramic picture of the person or thing in reality as it is. Do you understand that one? If you see the person or thing in reality as it is, very naturally you can see. Okay?

Why are there two things always interacting and et cetera? Well, this is because this is already the samsaric world. Samsaric world is always, you know, the two things there: good or bad, self-confident or not self-confident, et cetera. Okay? But you cannot always try to take care of your life with always self-confidence. Because, if you really want to have your life with self-confidence always, you should find a little bit easier circumstances [so] you can get the self-confidence. But the circumstances are always moving and changing, and [there are] favorable conditions or unfavorable conditions, always. Nevertheless, wherever you may be, under unfavorable conditions, you have to learn the self-confidence in which you have to stand up straight there. That is called the samsaric world. That’s why you have to learn *both*: self-confidence and difficult-to-get-the-self-confidence. You have to learn both; both are important. 

But usually we believe only self-confidence is important: “If you don’t have the self-confidence, it’s bad.” That means you destroy the *samsara*. Do you understand? *Samsara* is always self-confidence [and] simultaneously not-self-confidence. That is *samsara*. But this *samsara* world is grounded on *tathagatagarbha* means the truth. That’s why self-confidence or not-self-confidence, both are important. That’s why through not-self-confidence you can learn how important self-confidence is for you. 

So under *all* circumstances, we have to learn how to stand up straight with self-confidence. Do you understand that one? That is the *tathagatagarbha*, anyway. *[He chuckles.]* *Tathagatagarbha* is not only ideas, but also it’s pretty deep meaning. Practically you should do it. Because in *samsara* human beings always have one-sided ideas. That’s why Buddha also always give [pieces of advice] for us: “Don’t be stuck in one-sided ideas.” So we have to learn both.

[What time is it?] ... one more question?

**Someone:** The truth is manifesting itself in the phenomenal world. And then it seems to me that the phenomenal world is resting on the truth. And that if somehow truth were snatched away, the phenomenal world would collapse. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** [What’s the point]? *[He laughs.]*

**Someone:** That if truth were taken away, that the samsaric world would collapse.

**Katagiri Roshi:** [I don’t think so.] *Samsara* rests in the truth?

**Someone:** Well, the samsaric world is resting on the truth. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** I don’t think this is... It’s pretty difficult to say in words, that’s why next I have to explain [peace]. In this book, it says, “Absolute truth and samsaric world diffuse harmoniously with each other.” This is [something] I have to explain a little more. Okay? It’s not that *samsara* is the top and absolute is the bottom. *[He laughs.]* I don’t think so. 

Okay? Is that alright? 

*[Laughter.]* *[He laughs.]*

That means the one piece of paper [with] two aspects. It’s moving constantly, alright? So you cannot say which is top, which is bottom. 

Practically speaking, if you put blue sunglasses [on], the whole world becomes blue. Next moment, when you change to brown sunglasses, immediately the whole world becomes brown. That’s it. Alright? So where do you stand up? When you stand up in *samsara*, the whole world becomes *samsara*. When you stand up in the absolute, and then looking at the human world, the whole world becomes absolute. 

In other words, if you are angry, if you are mad at somebody, the whole world is mad. *[He laughs.]* If you see the human world with disoriented mind, the whole world is disoriented.

That is so-called *peace* and *harmonious*: coming in, interacting together. You cannot say which is top, which is bottom. When you show the front, that’s it: the whole world is front. When you show the back, whole world is back. That is, Dōgen Zenji says, “when one side appears, the other side is darkness.” 

So next time I can explain a little more about this to you.
