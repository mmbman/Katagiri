**Katagiri Roshi:** Case 5 of *Blue Cliff Record*:

> Hsueh Feng, Seppō Zen Master, teaching his community, said, “Pick up the whole great earth in your fingers, and it is as big as a grain of rice. Throw it down before you: if, like a lacquer bucket, you don’t understand, I will beat the drum to call everyone to look.”

This is the case [or] story [...]

Briefly speaking, Seppō Zen Master said to everyone, “Pick up the whole great earth in your fingers.” *Fingers* doesn’t mean just his fingers. Anyway we have to pick up... *pick up* means to do something with, right now, right here. That is *pick up*. Beyond time and space. If you pick up something objectively, that is you pick, your behavior, your doing is something which you do objectively. Pick up this piece of paper: that is already time there. But pick up the whole great earth in your fingers with your whole body: no time, no space. Anyway you have to pick up, pick up means you have to live in the universe right now, right here. So the universe must be alive in your life. 

Next: how. How the universe is working. He said, “it’s as big as a grain of rice.” Even a grain of rice, that is a universe.

When I was in San Francisco, Suzuki Roshi said, “The whole universe is in a cup.” So the monks asked the Zen Master, how can I understand the universe? So Zen Master says, “Drink a cup of tea, and then you can see the whole universe in the cup.” 

So students who listened to Suzuki Roshi’s lecture, and after his lecture we had a discussion, and he asked Suzuki Roshi, how can I see the universe? So he said, “Pick up your cup.” Immediately that student looked at the inside of the cup and said, “No universe in it.” *[He chuckles.]* And immediately that student threw it away to the floor and broke the cup. Suzuki Roshi said, “Poor tea.”

That is not to pick up the universe, pick up the great earth. In the cup, at that time if you try to look at the universe in the cup, in the grain of rice, or with your fingers, already that is the human doings created by you, subject and object, in the system of time process. But no matter how long you try to find the universe in that way, you cannot do it. Finally if you do this, you really kill the life of tea, the life of cup, because nothing to [fit]. So finally you are really disappointed. 

Well, look at your zazen. Zazen is exact to look at, pick up the universe simultaneously. But you always try to pick up the universe with your fingers, with your eyes, with your consciousness. That is pretty hard. Finally you have to kill the life of zazen, life of your breath, life of your life. Disappointed. 

That’s why “it is as big as a grain of rice.” Whatever you say – theologically speaking or physiologically speaking, okay? *[He laughs.]* Whatever you say: Buddha is in us. Buddha is us. We are Buddha. Buddha is earth. Or flower is in God, in Buddha. Whatever you say, this is completely wrong. Do you understand? Whatever you say, this is nothing but the theology, nothing but the Buddhology. That’s all. Don’t you think so? 

You create a poem: “how beautiful, rose, oh beautiful.” Rose is not rose, rose is in Buddha. Rose is in God. Whatever you say. Universe, whatever you say. This is nothing but the word. 

Finally, rose is what? Rose means what? If you see the rose, yes, rose. That rose is already rose in the dualistic world you pick up with your consciousness, with your eyes. [That] rose. And then if you pick up rose in the dualistic world, next, you don’t satisfy. That’s why you have to systematize what you said, what you have experienced. How? Well, that is the study of Buddhism, study of Christianity, theology, Buddhology, etc. Then it says, “Rose is in God. God is in rose.” Finally, we [aren’t satisfied with] this statement either. So finally it says, “Rose *is* God. God is rose.” Still we [aren’t satisfied]. 

Finally, how can you say it? Finally, what you can say is “Rose. Oh! Rose.” That’s all. “All” means completely beyond human speculation. Nothing to say. Completely beyond theology, buddhology, words, speculations. And finally, right after “Oh,” here is rose. That rose is completely something as it is. Just there. Blooming with the universe. 

I told you before, one of the poets composed a poem in Japan, when he visited one of those outstanding sightseeing places, [Matsushima]. [...] He said, 

> Matsushima  
> Oh! Matsushima  
> Matsushima...
> Matsushima!

This is a poem, a beautiful poem. *[He laughs.]* We don’t understand. Matsushima is first Matsushima, and next, “Oh!” And next, Matsushima, Matsushima, Matsushima. 

That means the first Matsushima is, well, the usual Matsushima. Katagiri, this flower. Oh! This flower. And next, according to the first Matsushima, you can see the many Matsushimas – according to your eyes, according to your nose, according to your ears, according to your consciousness – many Matsushimas come out. And then, you don’t know: what is a Matsushima? So finally, your frontal lobe starts to work, and tries to analyze, synthesize, organize all things, and try to find, systematize: what is Matsushima? That is the philosophy, psychology, and physics, biology, et cetera. 

But finally, you [aren’t satisfied], yet. Finally all you have to do is, just standing, just be present in Matsushima. Well, how can I explain? Just “oh.” Well right after experiencing a great “oh,” nothing to say. What is the beauty of Matsushima? Nothing to say. What is the beauty of a famous painting, or a famous sculpture, whatever it is? You cannot say what is the beauty of a dance, what is the beauty of piano music. You cannot say. So if you want to know the beauty of music, of piano, and orchestra, anyway, listen, just listen to it. Just listen, that’s all. 

And then that listening is – no explanation. But if you want to explain, but when that music touches your heart, at that time some words come up. That is a simple word: “Oh!” That’s all. 

And then after this experience of beautiful music, orchestra, at that time orchestra is completely different from orchestra you have experienced at the first stage, or Matsushima. Completely that is something as it is. Performing orchestra with the universe – not with the singer, not with the piano, not with the audience, [but] with the universe. At that time, that is completely beautiful orchestra. Matsushima, Matsushima, Matsushima – that’s all. 

So this case says, it’s as big as a grain of rice. Whatever it is, whatever you see, that is already the universe. 

#### 13:16

> “Throw it down before you: if, like a lacquer bucket, you don’t understand...” 

“Throw it down before you” means [...] where is the universe? Universe with you, universe of grain of rice, universe with is in gassho. Universe in rose, universe in Matsushima, dharmas, wherever. 

If it is true, even though you don’t, universe is completely beyond human speculation, universe is with you. As long as it is with us, it is something you can experience. So, sooner or later, when the universe touches your heart, at that time you say “Yeah, I got it.” *[He laughs.]* “I got it” means already you are “throwing away” before. “I got it.” 

But what do you throw away? Something you have thrown away is just like a lacquer bucket. That lacquer bucket is a black lacquer bucket. You throw it away, you throw away the black lacquer bucket at night, darkness. You don’t miss it. The moment when you throw it away, you want to really keep it, keep it, okay? 

For instance, enlightenment. Or feeling good in zazen. So, you can experience it. If you experience something like this, immediately, happy. That happy means already throw it away, before you. 

And then, we usually hang on to this. Because we don’t want it to go away, so we try to keep it. But, no matter how long you try to depend on something you have experienced, you have to throw it away, is nothing but black lacquer bucket at midnight. So, finally, it is. What you have experienced is no [...], the truth or universe itself. So that is something you have picked up through your consciousness. That’s why finally, you don’t satisfy your experience. So, next moment: this is enlightenment? This is a real right experience through zazen? Shall I call it enlightenment? Shall I call it delusion? 

So, finally, we don’t understand. We don’t understand. 

So the case says, 

> ... I will beat the drum to call everyone to look.

So, Seppō says, if you don’t understand, why don’t you call everybody to look at by hitting the drum. To hit the drum means the signal of collecting the people to sit in the same room and listen to Budha’s teaching. So in order to have a lecture, before the lecture we hit the drum. That is a signal of a lecture or Buddha’s teaching to start. So, why don’t you hit the drum and call everyone to look for what the universe here. If you don’t understand, why don’t you ask everybody who has experience. Well that means not only the people, why don’t you ask? Why don’t you call everyone, everything: scientists, psychology, philosophy, biology, and... to look at the universe. Why don’t you look at the universe? Modern scientists say, “Wow, wonderful. Buddhism is wonderful,” because Buddhism already said what the universe is. So, scientists gradually understand the universe, so if you look at the universe through the scientist, maybe it’s wonderful. So, why don’t you call everyone – famous scientists, famous scholars, famous religious leaders – anyway call everyone to look at the universe. And listen to the universe; you can listen. 

But, even though that speech, and scientists and the philosophy, psychology touch your heart, saying what the universe is, but still you don’t satisfy. Finally, how can you do it? 

*You yourself* have to touch the universe. That’s all you have to do. Words given by scholars, religious leaders, and Buddhists, well, those words are not yours, [they are] others’ words. 

So, that’s why this case says, “I’ll beat the drum to call everyone to look.” 

This case is really explaining modern civilization. Lots of chances: we can look at the universe, we can look at the truth. We are lucky, in a sense, because lots of chances. But I don’t know if we are lucky or not. We have to be careful. 

This is a simple explanation, well, not explanation, but anyway, explanation of the main case. 

Seppō is a Zen master who was one of the outstanding Zen teachers in China. In the commentary to this main case, here is a very interesting commentary.

> Seppō (Hsueh Feng), teaching his assembly, said, “Pick up the whole great earth in your fingers, and it’s as big as a grain of rice.” 

This is a commentary to this statement:

> There was something extraordinary in the way this Ancient guided people and benefited beings. He was indefatigably rigorous; three times he climbed (Mount) T’ou Tzu, nine times he went to Tung Shan...

That means in ancient China, all famous monks visited Zen teachers, as many as possible. But in those days, particularly in China, the practice of Zen was very tough, very tough. Well if you eat... Zen training in China, sometimes, very often, many monks were killed by training of Zen. It was very tough, very tough. Nevertheless, Seppō Zen master visited one teacher three times and the other teacher nine times. Those teachers were also outstanding Zen teachers. 

Well, I don’t think that Zen training must be so tough that you would have to be killed by the training of Zen. But if you study Zen through books, most people understand Zen which is very tough. That’s why one of the American scholars says that Zen is too tough to practice for Americans. So I said, “How come?” He said, “American are very lazy.” *[He laughs.]* I don’t think so. But anyway, if you study Zen through books, particularly in China, it was very tough. But I don’t think it’s necessary to do this. 

But, I don’t think you should be lazy. Because from century after century, we shouldn’t forget there is a basic human effort. That basic human effort is anyway to realize the universe, and also this universe must be alive in our daily life. Before you explain, before you distinguish, or before you are conscious of it, the universe must be alive. In order to do this, from century after century many people have made great effort to practice zazen and Zen teaching. So we shouldn’t be lazy, but we shouldn’t be too tough. 

Anyway, we should recognize how hard practice Seppō Zen Master did. 

> Wherever he went, he would set up his lacquer tub and wooden spoon and serve as the rice steward, just for the sake of penetrating this matter.
> 
> When he arrived at Tung Shan, ...

Tung-Shan is one of the Zen teachers who was founder of Soto tradition in China.

> ... he served as the rice steward; one day Tung Shan asked Seppō (Hsueh Feng), “What are you doing?” Seppō said, “Cleaning rice.” Shan asked, “Are you washing the grit to get rid of the rice, or are you washing the rice to get rid of the grit?” Seppō said, “Grit and rice are both removed at once.” 

*[He laughs.]*

Well, this is a very good answer, because Seppō already knows what the universe is. So, if even though Tung Shan says, “Are you washing the grit to get rid of the rice, or washing the rice to get rid of the grit,” this is nothing but the words. So, in Seppō’s heart, he said to Zen teachers, “Shut up.” *[Laughter.]* He didn’t say so, but in his heart he said, “Shut up.” That’s why he said, “Grit and rice are both simultaneously removed.” There are no words.

But, Tōzan (Tung Shan) Zen Master, also still not enough. So,

> Shan said, “What will everybody eat?”

Well, because if you remove both grit and rice simultaneously, what are you eating? So, nothing. Then, Seppō... Genpo... *[Laughter.]* You should read this Zen story. It’s very fun. *[Laughter.]* It’s not fun; it’s really touching the core. There is no room to explain why he behaved in that way. There is no room. If you read the end what I did, immediately something happens, and the next moment happens, but there is no connection. But, it’s really touching your heart. But, we don’t know why. 

But, that is grit. Then, that is, Shan said, “What will everybody eat?” Seppō Zen Master completely overturned the basin. In the basin there is rice, okay? And with grit. And, what will everybody eat? Immediately Seppō overturned the basin. It’s completely, “Shut up.” Completely “shut up.” 

And then, Tōzan Zen Master saw also more than the Seppō. *[He laughs.]* More than Seppō. Great. This Seppō was great, but he was not good enough. So, Tōzan says, “Your affinity lies with Te Shan.” So, you are great monk, but I cannot take care of you. Why don’t you go to other teacher, named Te Shan. Te Shan was also tough; tougher than Tōzan and Seppō or any other monk, teachers. Really tough. So, why don’t you go there? *[He laughs.]* 

So, Tōzan Zen master was never surprised. Whatever Seppō did, “Oh, you are great. So, you are not my student. I cannot take care of you. Well, there is another teacher who can take care of you. Why don’t you go there?” So, he accepted. But actually, Tōzan didn’t want him to go, but he said it and the Seppō accepted. That is... 

Well, we don’t understand this, but... *[Laughter.]* We are very honest... If somebody says, “Get out,” you are very straightforward, you say, “Thanks, I am going out.” But straightforward honesty is sometimes good, but it’s not good, for you. If someone says, “Get out,” well, sometimes you have to get out, but sometimes it’s not necessary to get out. In order to seek for the truth, you shouldn’t get out. Wherever you may go, anyway, truth is there. 

#### 32:26

And then, 

> As soon as he got there, Seppō (Hsueh Feng) asked, “Does this student have any share in this matter handed down from antiquity as the fundamental vehicle?”

This is what Seppō said after seeing Te Shan. Te Shan was very tough, okay? Seppō asked him, “Does this student have any share in this matter handed down from antiquity as the fundamental vehicle?” That means, does this kind of student have the defined or realized Buddha nature or not? In other words, can I have the capability to attain enlightenment, to realize enlightenment itself? 

So immediately,

> Te Shan struck him a blow and said, “What are you saying?”

In Japan, also a famous Zen teacher, Sawaki Roshi was a great Zen teacher, who was a completely different type of Zen teacher from other teachers. He didn’t have any temples, he didn’t have any position, which is called Zen master or whatever it is. He completely ignored that. And then all he could do was to teach zazen. As whenever he was asked by people [for] sesshin, zazen – he always travelled all over Japan, all Europe. 

So, one Buddhist lay, old gentleman, they had been practicing for many, many years under the guidance of this famous Zen teacher. And then finally he said, “I was a very stupid person, and I have lots of delusions. Even though I have been practicing for many, many years, still I have lots of delusions. Do I have a chance to attain enlightenment?” Immediately the Zen teacher said, “You are a coward.” *[He laughs.]* Do you understand? *Coward*. That word is really “pithy,” don’t you think so? “Coward” means, well, there is no discussion, “Shall I have, or shall I not have?” Completely beyond. “Coward”: immediately, big shock. 

Well, that’s pretty good. And still he didn’t attain enlightenment... *[he laughs,]* but this is pretty good for us.

So Seppō said the same thing: “Do I have a chance to attain enlightenment or not?” So, Te Shan says, “What are you doing? What are you saying?” And he hit [him]. 

So, that is, the universe means... but Tōzan Zen master really cut off delusions of thinking rice and grit in the dualistic world. Rice and grit are the beings in the dualistic world, but practically, you shouldn’t handle both of them in the dualistic world, you have to handle both of them in the universe. That means you have to handle both of them as a buddha. So, grit , grit is grit. Rice, rice is rice. Rice is the universe, grit is nothing but the universe. 

So there is no discrimination between the grit and rice. If you say, “I am washing [the rice to get rid of the grit],” at that time, grit is a little bit something inferior, something lower level of being. So, rice is better than grit. If you think, “I am washing the rice to get rid of the grit,” well, there is still inferior complex and superior complex. That is evaluation. 

But you cannot handle it in that way. In order to [make the] universe alive in your life, practically you should handle both of them in equality as a buddha. So, when grit appears, how can you handle grit as a buddha? 

That’s why when Seppō overturned the basin, at that time grit and rice disappeared. At that time, where is the dualism? No dualism. At that time, how can you exist? You cannot exist. 

That’s why Tōzan then said, “What will everyone eat next morning?” 

But Seppō is really always staying in the highest level of spirituality, always oneness. If you are always in the highest level of oneness, you can cut down everything. What is grit? What is rice? You can overturn completely the basin, throw away both of them. It’s really sharp, and it’s really attractive, but it doesn’t work in the dualistic world, human beings. 

So finally, you cannot ignore the reality that there are many monks who need rice, who need food. And also there are many beings named rice and grit... [bowl...] If you ignore this, how can we survive? 

So finally, we have to come down to the human world, to take care of grit and rice in order to support human beings. 

Okay. Tomorrow I would like to study the Pointer. 

Do you have a question? 

#### 41:26

If you study or listen to whatever religion – Bhagavad Gita, and the Upanishads, and Hinduism, even Buddhism – you could be impressed very much because they emphasize oneness of the universe and the human world. The problem is, if you study the Eastern religions, you cannot know what’s the difference among the Hinduism and the Bhagavad Gita and the Upanishads and Buddhism, because they emphasize *almost* the same things. The Hindu philosophy, Bhagavad Gita philosophy, and Upanishad philosophy, is almost the same. That’s why we don’t realize what’s the difference. Well, it’s not necessary to point out what’s the difference is, but... Well, it’s not necessary to *know* the difference among them, but the important point, even though you understand everything they are saying, the point is that truth must be not something you can understand in the consciousness. Truth is something *alive*, vividly, in your life. Before the truth advances in thought, in consciousness anyway. 

That is pretty hard to understand. But intellectually, even though I say so, well, everything – Bhagavad Gita, Upanishads – they always emphasize this. But the point is that you yourself must be alive in the universe. 

Buddhism always emphasizes that point. Particularly Zen really emphasizes this. 

So whatever you understand – whether you answer yes or no about the wonders of the universe, my life is exactly one with the universe or not – Zen doesn’t accept [this], because constantly it must be alive. 

Tomorrow I will explain a little bit about human arrogance, okay? Arrogance is really delicate, don’t you think so? *[He laughs.]* Very [...] delicate [...]. Whatever you think, whether you take the answer yes or no, this is nothing but arrogance. You don’t know exactly. 

For instance, if you say, “I experience wonderful things through zazen,” at that time, immediately, it is nothing but to throw away the truth before you, but you don’t understand. But if you throw away your experience, the truth as your experience. And...

*[Tape change.]*

... that’s pretty hard to realize, to touch, to pin down what arrogance is. 

In Buddhism, seven categories of arrogance. *[He laughs.]* It’s very interesting. 

Anyway, Zen constantly emphasizes actual practice which [vivified] constantly. But on the other hand, we shouldn’t ignore study of the truth philosophically, psychologically. Or going to Bhagavad Gita, Upanishads, et cetera. Because everything is connected. So we shouldn’t ignore. There is no reason we should ignore anything. So it’s okay. If you want to poke your head in to many things: fine, beautiful. 

But the final approach is very simple, a very simple practice. 

In order to be stable there, it’s very hard. It takes time. It really takes time. 

For instance, zazen. Zazen is very practical, a very simple practice. But intellectually, if zazen must be backed by philosophy, Buddhist philosophy, psychology. But practically zazen is very simple, which is urgent, we have to do, completely beyond like or dislike. This is the meaning of zazen. 

Because this is perfect stability, or peace, or harmony, etc. We don’t understand, we cannot stand up there, because it’s too simple, too simple. Even the practice is very simple.

But look at your zazen. Can you be alive fully in the world in the zazen you do now? Even a moment, you are not alive. You are sort of a dead in the world of zazen. That is a simple, simple world. Nothing to do. Don’t think; it’s not necessary to think. With the body and mind, why don’t you sit down? Within this, even within this simple world, we cannot be alive. We are too dead. 

That’s why, constantly, we have to do this. Even though you yawn, or you feel boredom, even though you sleep constantly, or even though you hate it – as long as you are a human being, a human being must be alive in the universe, because by the universe you are, so you will survive, you should appreciate. Appreciating is not to think something philosophically; appreciation is something you have to do with the universe. 

So, if you do zazen, this is your whole world, universe. So, zazen is your life, exactly. As long as you do zazen, this is you. Don’t you think so? 

So your consciousness always compares, before zazen, after zazen, always compares. “I got up this morning, and I will go to sleep at nine” – always thinking something. But this is not your whole world; this is the image of your life. You always create image of life. Get up in the morning, now I am doing, next moment I could attain enlightenment, and next moment, maybe I want to go to sleep. [That] life is really image, nothing but the image. 

So, image is beautiful, sometimes very helpful for you. But image is image. Image, in order to make the image alive, anyway, you should know, how can you make image of life alive, right now, right here, in the realm of zazen. 

So, practically, your focus must be right on, [...] moment. But your image really extends through the past, the present, future. That’s fine, beautiful. Without this, you cannot exist. But practically, your focus must be right on. At that time, that *right on* is really to be alive. That is your whole life. 

That’s why, just sit down, just sit down. 

If I give you something else, accept your body and mind, taking care of your breath, that is something extra. Whatever it is, spiritually or materialistically, or whatever it is, if you bring in, that is extra. 

All you have to do is, with your body and mind, just be present and just be alive. That you is not you, that is what is called the universe. 

And then, you feel something. If you do zazen like this, you feel something, because already you touch it. That’s why you feel. If you feel, immediately you throw it away, before you are directed. That is already something else. You don’t know. 

So, constantly all you have to do is, just be alive. It’s a very simple practice. 

But, this simplicity must be backed by the practical, psychological understanding. This is the study of Buddhism. Well, one by one, you should study. 

But practically, even though you don’t understand Buddhism, never mind. Okay? If you don’t like psychology, or Buddhist psychology, or the *Abhidharma-kosha*: don’t worry. Forget it. Still, there is an important thing you have to do. [...] life must be alive, right now right here, with clear mind. Looking at your life in broad vision, in the broad perspective. Nevertheless your life, right now right here, shouldn’t be tossed away by these images. Your effort must be focused on right now right here. At that time, it’s really extended, extending to past, present and future. Very naturally, you grow, you develop, you deepen yourself. 

But this practice is very hard. 

But, whatever you do, this is not only zazen but whatever you do, this is the basic human practice. As a dancer, as a painter, as a musician – if you take away all things, all thoughts, pros and cons, success and failure, and criticism, and all things – first, why don’t you take away all things? Finally, what’s left? That’s it. If you want to be as a musician, what’s left? All you have to do is just the practice. The more you are famous, the more you realize how important practice is. From day to day. That is the very basic practice. 

But we are always, well, waffling, or tossed away by pros and cons, failure and success, you have experienced *after* you are doing, *after* your practice, always. And then completely you lose the sight of yourself. But, this is not real life as a musician, as a dancer, as a painter, whatever. Basically, what should you do? Whatever happens, after taking away all those thoughts, complications, finally what’s left? Very simple practice. Just continue to practice. Just sit down, just sit down in front of the piano and play. Just play. Regardless of whether you become famous or not. Anyway, shut up, keep your mouth shut and do your best, with your sincerity, with your true heart. That is the very basic practice. 

Zazen teaches you that way. 

I always tell you this point, but still it’s pretty hard to touch, to pin down what it is. But we have to do constantly like this.
