Case 44: “Ho Shan’s Knowing How to Beat the Drum”

The case:

> Ho Shan imparted some words saying, “Cultivating study is called ‘learning.’ Cutting off study is called ‘nearness.’ Going beyond these two is to be considered real going beyond.”
>
> A monk came forward and asked, “What is ‘real going beyond’?” Shan said, “Knowing how to beat the drum.”
>
> Again he asked, “What is the real truth?” Shan said, “Knowing how to beat the drum.”
> 
> Again he asked, “‘Mind is Buddha’—I’m not asking about this. What is not mind and not Buddha?” Shan said, “Knowing how to beat the drum.”
>
> Again he asked, “When a transcendent man comes, how do you receive him?” Shan said, “Knowing how to beat the drum.”
> 
> ( From *The Blue Cliff Record*, translated by Thomas Cleary & J.C. Cleary)

Ho Shan (Hoshan Wuyin) was the seventh patriarch from *[unintelligible]*; he died in 960. He was [a dharma heir] of the famous Zen Master Kyūhō Dōken (Jiufeng Daoqian). I think you can see [a simple version of] his history toward the back of this book. You can read it later. 

#### 

> Ho Shan imparted some words saying,  “Cultivating study is called ‘learning.’ ...”

Originally it says *hearing*, but this translator says *learning*. 

So cultivating study means usually we learn [by studying] something step by step, one by one. We say *shugaku* in Japanese. *Shu* means just like a baby bird trying to learn how to fly in the sky. So every day, every moment, baby bird has to practice moving his wings. That is the meaning of *shu*, we say *learn* in English. *Gaku* is *study*. But this translator says “cultivating study.” 

“Cultivating study is called ‘learning’” means that with your six consciousnesses, you can hear Buddha’s teaching, and also you can hear what the human world is. The human world is really the samsaric world: nothing but the repetition of life and death, filled with suffering and pain, et cetera. In Buddhism *suffering* means not only the suffering but also pleasure, and pain, and neutral feeling. [That is] also suffering; we say *dukkha*. So whatever kind of feeling you have – feeling good, or you don’t feel good, or you don’t feel anything, just neutral – all are called *dukkha*. It means suffering – because it doesn’t last for long. 

Basically, human life always stands in the stream of impermanence. So if you realize this point, how the human world is structured, “life is characterize by suffering” means how impermanent human life is – not only human beings, but also all sentient beings. So if you really see deeply into and touch the core of the impermanence of the world, at that time you can really awaken to the truth. That is the first step to step into the Buddha’s world. So we say “stream-winner” – one of the arhats; a “saint”. “Stream-winner” means you can really tune into the rhythm of the stream of the river, the stream of impermanence. You can tune in. That is stream-winner; that is the first stage of the sage. 

So through the six consciousnesses we really see deeply how human life and the human world is going. And also we can really see nirvana, which means peace and harmony, through the Buddha’s teaching. So we really see this point through our six consciousnesses, and then we can hear the teaching, and then we really believe in Buddha’s teaching with our mind. And then next we want to put it into practice with our body. We really want to experience nirvana through the teaching – through hearing the teaching, through believing, through practicing [it] with your body. That is called “cultivating study”. So that’s why [it says] “Cultivating study is called ‘hearing’.” 

#### 

> “... Cutting off study is called ‘nearness.’ ...”

So finally you can *cut off* – “cut off” means be free from – human suffering. [That] means you can really tune into the rhythm of the stream of impermanence. Not throw it away; you can really tune into the rhythm of impermanence. That is called *cut off*, or we say [you are a] *stream-winner*. If you can really live right in the middle of impermanence but you are not carried away by impermanence or suffering so much, [...] this is called “cutting off studying is called ‘nearness’.” 

“Cutting off studying” means you can study until there is nothing to study. That is called *mugaku* – *not-study*. That is *freedom*. 

So this is freedom, but it is called nearness. [It is] not exactly perfect freedom. Still, [it’s] pretty close. [It’s not perfect] because we are still stuck in the freedom. Real freedom is [that] your body and mind must be free just like [flowing] water in your everyday life. That is real freedom. You cannot pick up the freedom as an idea, because your body and mind are nothing but freedom itself. So if you pick up [the freedom] from your body, from your life, and see the freedom, it’s already not *real* freedom – it is a *concept* of freedom.

#### 12:00

So next,

> ... “Going beyond these two is to be considered real going beyond.”

That means truth; real freedom.

So [there are] three points which people can experience through the Buddha’s teaching, mentioned by a priest name Sōjō (Sengzhao or Seng-Chao) who wrote the book *Jewel Treasure Treatise*. In this book he mentions there are three types [of experience]: hearing, nearness, and truth. 

*Shugaku*: that is learning, hearing. So the first step we really get into the Buddha’s teaching, being free from human samsara, through our six consciousnesses: hearing. And then we can learn something. We have to learn, and then we every day we have to practice it again and again. Finally, you can really tune the dial in, you can really hit the underground spring, and then you get the water coming up through the pipe. That is “nearness.” And the third type [of experience] is the truth. Truth is perfect freedom.

[*Jewel Treasure Treatise*] says it just like this case: Cultivating study is called “learning.” Cutting off study is called “nearness.” Going beyond these two is to be considered as the truth.

#### 14:50

So Ho Shan extolled this point, the three types [of experience], to the assembly. Immediately,

> A monk came forward and asked, “What is ‘real going beyond’?” 

That means, what is the truth? What is the truth being free from the first type or second type? The first type is using your six consciousnesses, listening to the Buddha’s teaching, listening to the sound of the human world. And then the second type [...] is really be free from this human samsaric suffering, and also acquiring the Buddha’s teaching. That is called cutting off, freedom. So very naturally you can step [into] freedom. But it is not good enough, because you still are stuck in freedom, happiness. You’re very proud of yourself at that time. That’s why [there is] the final goal which Buddhism emphasizes constantly which is to be free from, to go beyond, the first two types of [experience]. Well, not only Buddha’s teaching, but whatever you do, you have to go through this process.

When I was a monk, my teacher said, “You should learn calligraphy,” because my teacher was a pretty good calligrapher. But he didn’t say “I will teach you how to write calligraphy.” So I watched his way of writing carefully every day, because he wrote calligraphy almost every day. So [I stayed] by him and watched his calligraphy, and also learned how to carry his brush. And then every day I took a brush and practiced. And also I had a particular textbook written by a famous calligrapher. So, listening to his rhythm, and also reading, and understanding, with my whole six consciousnesses. Anyway, every day I practiced.

So he said, “You should learn calligraphy under the guidance of a teacher first.” [...] The guidance of a teacher and guidance of a book; [this is a] good example. This is the first stage. 

And then the teacher says, “If you master this textbook through and through, or if you master a certain type of calligraphy shown by a certain teacher – next, you should learn a completely different type of calligraphy.” At that time, you can really be free from the certain type of calligraphy which you have learned under a certain teacher, and then you can learn. How can you be free from [the first way you learned] calligraphy? The teacher says you should break the wall [of what] you have learned. Because if you learn something, you are really stuck in there. [You think,] “I am a great calligrapher.” You have to break [that]. How to break it? You should learn a completely different type of calligraphy. 

So anyway, I studied, and then he said, “[You should] study a completely different type of calligraphy, and then you should return once more to the beginning. And then at that time you can [do the] first type of calligraphy which you have learned very naturally, coming up just like spring water.”

So this is the truth – real going beyond. This is the final goal. First, you have to hear, always, with your consciousnesses. And then next, you should be free from it. For this, how? [In the example of] calligraphy, you should learn a completely different type of calligraphy, and then you can break the first wall which you have acquired. And then, the first one comes up very naturally – without being stuck in the first type of calligraphy or the second type of calligraphy. You can go beyond.

This is very interesting; this is always a way of teaching in Japan, whatever you learn. Calligraphy, and also architecture, carpentry, or storytelling – whatever you do, the teacher always gives like this. This is a very interesting way of education. Because otherwise, you cannot help people; so you must be really free from the first wall and second wall you have acquired.

#### 22:33

So [that’s why] “A monk came forward and asked, “What is ‘real going beyond’?”” In other words, what is the real calligraphy which is going up very naturally? Natural as you can, without being carried away by the first type of calligraphy or second type of calligraphy. Anyway, how? What is this? How can we learn? 

So,

> Shan said, “Knowing how to beat the drum.”

This is a pretty interesting answer. If you want to really learn the third stage, you say always, let’s go through the first and second, and then you can go beyond the first and second. This is also pretty good. But he doesn’t say so. Immediately he says, “I know how to beat the drum” means everyday life. So if you want to be a storyteller in Japan under the guidance of a teacher, he says, if you ask a teacher how do we become a great storyteller just like you, how, probably he would tell you please get up in the morning when the time comes to get up, and clean the house, and make breakfast, and serve the teacher, and have breakfast, after breakfast wash your bowl. [...] But we don’t understand this point, because it’s just like usual life. So from where? Through this daily life, how can we learn to be master storyteller? It’s pretty hard. But this is a pretty good point. Because human beings are really greedy. So if you become greedy, it’s pretty hard to learn something real. You can learn something conceptual or philosophical or psychological, you can learn, but it’s very difficult to learn something real, penetrating your life, penetrating others’ life, and share your life with people, helping. It’s pretty hard. So that’s why, anyway, if you want to learn the master of storytelling, why don’t you take care of the tape recorder, with your compassion? As well as your life. This is the first step. That’s why he says, “I know how to beat the drum.” Because your life is really related, interconnected, with all sentient beings. So even though you go to school and you can learn something step by step, but it doesn’t work in your daily life, because you can learn something intellectually, so your head becomes big, but your life doesn’t work. 

So mastering something is not to stamp knowledge into your head. To master something is to share your life with the people through everyday life. But it is very slow-going, slow-going story. You cannot stand up, you cannot be patient, because people really want to rush into the goal, and then get the richness, happiness, and success, et cetera. So, very greedy. 

#### 27:27

So this answer probably made this monk disappointed. Because Ho Shan said, I know how to beat the drum. So, 

> Again he asked, “What is the real truth?” 

That is almost the same question as the first question. The first question says, “What is the real going beyond?” And the second question is, “What is the real truth?” Almost a double question. But anyway, he didn’t understand, so that’s why secondly he asked again, “What is the truth?” Shan said the same thing:

> “Knowing how to beat the drum.”

So this is the truth. 

> Again he asked, “‘Mind is Buddha’—I am not asking about this. What is not mind and not Buddha?”

In those days, almost eighth century, when Baso Zen Master lived, Baso Zen Master emphasizes his teaching based on “mind is Buddha”. Buddha is mind. We say, “soko shin soko butsu”. Soko means identity. shin means mind. ... means ... Butsu means Buddha. So Buddha is exactly identical with mind. Just like the Heart Sutra, we say form is emptiness, emptiness is form. We use *is*. But anyway, mind is Buddha. But this is a big koan in those days. In every monastery, monks really research about this. 

So one day a monk asked Baso Zen Master, “Why do you teach ‘mind is Buddha’?” And Baso Zen Master said, “Because of stopping a baby from crying.” It means if Buddha is separate from mind, your mind, your life, at that time no matter how long you try to get it, you never get it. Because it’s already something separate from you. Something separate from you you never get. So always you can get something within you; that’s why you can get it. For instance, you say microphone. I can get a microphone because even though the microphone is separated from you, and then you say I can get the microphone separated from me, but it’s not true. Microphone is already you have it, before you get it. Because if you see the microphone, microphone is immediately reflected in your mirror, so-called your sense organs. Sense organs and object, simultaneously it reflects it. And then the function of consciousness joins them, sense organs, sense objects. And the sixth consciousness thinks and judges. “Oh, this is microphone.” And then we say, “Yes, this is microphone.” 

So how do you understand microphone? You already have a microphone, in you. So you can get the microphone. You get this microphone, but this microphone is not the real microphone, because microphone is you get the microphone reflected in your mirror. That’s why sooner or later it’s separate from you. It doesn’t stay with you for long. And then the next moment you want to keep it, because you already have it. So that microphone you have is already image of the microphone. Real microphone is doesn’t care. Even though it’s gone from you, microphone is microphone. 

So always we have. Something separate from you cannot be acquired by you. This is Buddhist teaching, anyway. 

That’s why Baso Zen Master says, “If Buddha or spiritual life is something separate from you, at that time no matter how long you try to get it, you never get it.” That’s why you become just like a baby: crying, constantly. You want to get it. And then Baso Zen Master really expressed his compassion like a mother, because “I want to stop the baby’s crying.” How does he stop the baby crying? Because Buddha is with you. So your mind is Buddha, simultaneously. And then, maybe you can stop baby crying. 

And then the monk asked, “How is it when you have stopped the baby from crying?” In other words, after stopping the baby from crying, what is it? What is your teaching? And then Baso says, “Not mind. Not Buddha.” Because if Baso Zen Master says “your mind is Buddha simultaneously” so you are really stuck in the mind, or you are stuck in the Buddha. So, where is the Buddha? In the mind? Where is my mind? Inside or outside? Where is my Buddha? So you are looking for. And then if you cannot find it, you start to cry again. So if you can stop a baby crying, and then after that, what is your teaching? That teaching is “not mind, not Buddha.” Buddha is not something you try to find inside or outside or somewhere. Or mind also is not something you can find inside or outside, anyway. Mind or Buddha are that which manifested under certain conditioned elements. When the time is ripe, conditions arranged, it comes up. So when you do gassho exactly in peace and harmony, this is mind. Peaceful mind. That peaceful mind is called Buddha. So next moment you say, “What’s that?” What is peaceful mind? Next moment you are not peaceful, at that time it’s not Buddha. It’s not peaceful mind. So finally you say, “Shut up.” Anyway, do gassho in peace and harmony, right here right now, according to the Buddha’s and ancestors’ suggestions. In front of the Buddha. And then at that time, Buddha appears, peaceful mind appears. So only when time is ripe, conditions arranged, always mind there, Buddha there. But next moment, when you think, “Where is mind,” mind is really vague, vast. Buddha is also vast. So you don’t know. So, no mind. But kind of no mind, but no mind? Yes it is; when the time is ripe, conditions arranged, mind comes up. So mind is here, but mind is always with me? No, no mind. Not-mind. Next moment, not-mind, not-Buddha.

And then the monk still didn’t understand, so the monk asked Baso Zen Master, “He’s not talking teaching philosophy.” “Mind is Buddha, or Buddha is mind, not not-mind, or not-Buddha.” In other words, from the first stage, mind is Buddha means, anyway, go to school. Go to school and do your best, and then you can learn something. And then if you do it, school is you, if you do it, philosophy is with you, anyway. 

*[Tape change.]*

... And then at that time, the second stage is, if you go to school, how much school gives me the knowledge? Well, after graduation from the university, how much did you get the knowledge which is available or which is useful when you share your life with people? You don’t know. The knowledge you have accumulated, you have learned from school, are what? Nothing. So you have to become a beginner, *[he chuckles]*, when you work with the people. So you have to start to learn something new. 

So very naturally that is the second stage. Anyway, school is you, you are school. Anyway, go to school. And then, if you finish school, how much did you learn? Where is the knowledge? You cannot [be] stuck in your title of Ph.D. or Batchelor’s Degree or Master’s Degree. You cannot be stuck in them. Anyway, share your life with the people. How? No knowledge. No school. No you. Just jump into and share. 

That is the first stage, okay? Remember that.

And then the monk asked, “How should I deal with the person going beyond first and second?” He wanted to know the person who mastered completely the teaching of the mind is Buddha, and also free from, not mind not Buddha. Free from first and second. He’s not talking about teaching; he wants to know the reality then. When he sees somebody who is completely free from first and second. How can I deal with this kind of person? Baso Zen Master says, “not anything.” 

Not anything means you have to just see him. How do you see him? When you have to do gassho, just do gassho. And then that is you can see him. Why don’t you beat the drum, anyway? In the proper way. That’s enough. 

Anyway, that means the first stage you can learn, second stage you can be free from, and then third stage, you don’t know what it is, because we deny the first and second stage, so what is the real truth? So finally you say, “Never mind; forget it.” “Well, do as you like.” Because mind is Buddha. But not-mind, not-Buddha. So how can I live? Why not do as I like? Because no mind, no Buddha? Completely just denied, no mind and no Buddha, and also completely deny mind and Buddha. What’s left? What’s there? Completely something like. Only the table is left [tap], as a material thing, left. This karmic body is left. Instinct is left. You knowledge, your body is left, anyway. Because the spiritual aspect of your life is completely denied. Mind or Buddha, or not mind, not Buddha? If so, how do we live? Nothing there. You can really attach to nothing, so, if there is nothing to attach to, why don’t you live as you like? 

So that is the point most Zen students misunderstand this point. Zen always lets you be free, so do as you like. But this is a little bit careful, because in Buddhism, negation implies a state of freedom. A state of freedom of human life. So your body and your mind must be free in every aspect of your life. If so, if you do as you like according to your desires et cetera, at that time you are not free, anyway. So very naturally you are stuck in something. 

So very naturally this freedom, real freedom, must be actualized in everyday life. In every aspect of your life. Getting up in the morning, and having breakfast, in the breakfast freedom must be manifested there. When you do gassho, freedom must be actualized in the realm of gassho. 

So that is freedom. So using your consciousness, and then, you shouldn’t be stuck in your consciousness, because this is freedom. So the basic nature of your life is always using your consciousness, but you cannot stay with consciousness which you have used, because this is the real state of your human existence. So go there, and then next you become completely freedom. So next moment, you can go anyplace. If you like, you can stay, if you don’t like, you can go anyplace. 

So this is in terms of the truth, in terms of change or impermanence, you can use consciousness but you cannot stay with it. So just use consciousness, then, let it go. But on the other hand, in terms of human consciousness, there is very stinkiness there. So you must be a little bit careful. 

So at that time use consciousness and then participate in the microphone, but at that time, in terms of human consciousness, you shouldn’t create some gap between the microphone and you. In other words, double mind. You cannot create a gap. You cannot create a shadow of your mind. Anyway you should deal with the microphone as well as your life; exactly one. That is called *sincerity*; *true heart*. True heart is really human warm[ness], compassionate. True heart is really you can be intimate with the life of the microphone. That means not leave a shadow of your consciousness. So use your consciousness, jump into your object, but anyway, you should deal with the microphone with sincerity, true heart. 

That’s why you cannot say, “Hey, let’s use this microphone as I like.” No, you cannot do it. That’s why Baso Zen Master says, “not anything.” How can I deal with the microphone which is free from the first and second stage, anyway? Because this is enlightened being. If so, anyway, you cannot be stuck in the microphone as a material [entity]. Or you cannot be stuck in the microphone as a spiritual entity. You must be free from it. Because you have to deal with it. So you should use your spiritual thing, and nevertheless, in terms of Buddha’s world, in terms of truth, you must be clear. So, nothing to leave, no trace of your conscious perception. And next, in terms of human beings, human desires, you should deal with the microphone with sincerity, true heart. No shadow of your consciousness. That’s why Baso Zen Master says, “nothing else”. Not anything. How can we deal with the person who is free from anything? First stage, second stage? At that time, how can we deal with? Don’t be stuck in a thing called this guy, or that guy. Or “he is that guy who is attained enlightenment,” or “this guy who is not attained enlightenment.” Don’t be stuck in. Anyway, deal with. How can we deal? When you have to beat the drum, you have to beat the drum, with sincerity, true heart. Using your consciousness.

So that’s why the monk asked, “‘Mind is Buddha’—I am not asking about this.” Because this monk understands mind is Buddha. So [he asks,] “What is not mind and not Buddha?”

#### 52:12

And then Shan said, “Knowing how to beat the drum.”

If you see the person who is free from not mind, not Buddha, at that time, who is he? He is just the usual guy, anyway. The usual guy, but he’s not a usual guy. He’s still unusual guy. But apparently, he is a usual guy.

So how do we know he is not usual guy? That means, when he has to beat the drum, just beat the drum. The difference is ... degree. How much strong determination you have, how much intention you have. In other words, how strongly you hit the drum with sincerity, with a true heart. How do you use your sincerity, how do you use your true heart, when you beat the drum? That’s all. 

So through the hearing the sound of the drum, we can understand how much your practice is progressed. In Eiheiji monastery we hit the gong; each time, we bow. Full bows. One hit the gong, and bow. But every time the sound depends on the individual personality. If your a really rough guy, even though you hit it softly, still the sound is very rough. Even though the sound is very soft, still there is a kind of an absence of mind, scattering your mind. So it’s very interesting practice for us. That’s why every time, we bow. Because one hit of the drum, then bow, at that time, your body and your mind [are] exactly peaceful and harmonious, tuning into the rhythm of the gong’s life. And then next moment, you can really face directly the life of the gong, right in front of you. And then hold, then beginner. You start newly to hit the gong, with your wholeheartedness. 

So one day Zen Master called the monk who hit the gong in the morning, he asked the attendant, so he said the monks name. And then the Zen Master said, “Ah, I understand.” I understand the sound of the gong this morning, because of who hit it. Because he knows his practice, the quality of his life. So through the sound of the gong, you really understand how much your practice is progressed. And also this freedom is not something you can get immediately or you can get freedom by practicing for one year or two years; no. Life after life, you have to practice. 

Most of you met Thich Nhat Hanh. Well, that’s peace. Everyone feels exactly peace from him. Whoever you are, everyone felt in that way. Real peaceful guy. But that peace is not something you can get by practicing for a couple of years. No. 

And also, one more practice is, you should continue to practice not [in a] showy [way]. Very quiet practice. So mindfulness: he mentioned mindfulness. Mindfulness is not a showy practice. When you walk on the street, just walk on the street, with your breath, with your mind, with your ..., with your foot. And then finally, you can become one with the universe, with the rhythm of life. But this practice is not showy. You cannot show it to people. That’s why when you go to the bathroom, wash your face, and gassho to the basin, gassho to water, this practice is very calm practice. But it’s really powerful. If you practice day by day like this, very naturally, that freedom really blooms, the flower of freedom blooms. Just like Thich Nhat Hanh. 

But if you are really greedy in spiritual life, you cannot continue to practice like this. So that’s why even though you practice spiritual life, very naturally you become greedy. If you become greedy, you want to follow the teaching tracks, seminars, and training periods. And then, if you want to be a good student, you should attend the training period, you should take this class or that class. If you don’t, you are not a good student. Just like this. That is really greedy. You cannot be a really peaceful person, or you cannot really share your life with all sentient beings. 

How much that Thich Nhat Hanh teaches people, sure, how much he influences his life to all sentient beings? He doesn’t say anything. But his influence is really enormous, vast. Wherever he may go: just standing. That’s really great; helpful, for everyone. Don’t you think so? Don’t you feel in that way? You cannot forget him. Always in everybody’s heart, Thich Nhat Hanh is there. 

That freedom, or peace, or harmony, is not something you can get immediately, or for a couple of years’ practice. No; you cannot do it. So, that’s why bodhisattvas walk in the mist, from life after life ... forever, anyway. 

So very naturally, not mind, not Buddha, that is just like a Bodhisattva who is free from the concept of not mind, not Buddha. What is it? He knows how to beat the drum. That is Thich Nhat Hanh. He knows how to walk on the street, with all sentient beings. We say always, let’s walk on the street with all sentient beings. We don’t walk in that way. We always walk alone. We always walk alone; it’s a little bit bitter. But most people walk on the street with anger, hatred. Agonies. But whatever happens in your life, anyway when you walk on the street, let’s walk on the street with all sentient beings. How can you practice this? This is not teaching, this is something you have to do, every day. 

During this training where I said “when you get up in the morning, let’s chant the verse.” I am getting up in the morning, now, with all sentient beings, and then realize everything without throwing away anything at all. Anyway get up in the morning, and then sit down on your bed, do gassho, and chant a short verse. You don’t think this is an important practice, but this is really great practice for us. If you can  do it every day, life after life, you can do it. If you do it, this is really bodhisattva. 

So, bodhisattva knows how to beat the drum, bodhisattva knows how to get up in the morning with all sentient beings, bodhisattva knows how to wash his face with all sentient beings.

#### 1:04:07

> Again he asked, “When a transcendent man comes, how do you receive him?” Shan said, “Knowing how to beat the drum.”

This is really true. How do we know we are bodhisattvas? Anyway, we should know how to wash our face. How to get up in the morning. How to hit the bell. You believe this is a small little practice, but I don’t think this is small, a trifle. It is a huge practice. 

Well, we should contemplate this koan again and again, in your whole life. That’s why everyday life and daily routine is very important for us. 

My teacher taught me, anyway, very simple teaching: when people get up in the morning, please get up in the morning. When the people have breakfast, please have breakfast together. And then after that, if you don’t feel good, go to sleep. This is very simple suggestions, but it’s really important practice for us, because we missed this important practice. 

That’s why in a Zen monastery everyday it is very important for us. Walking, hitting the drum, and chanting, reading a book, anyway we have to do with our sincerity, true heart.
