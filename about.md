#### by Kikan Michael Howard

Dainin Katagiri Roshi was one of the prominent Zen masters who brought Soto Zen Buddhism from Japan to the United States. (*Roshi* is an honorific meaning *distinguished elder teacher*.) Audio recordings of many of his talks are made available online by [Minnesota Zen Meditation Center](https://www.mnzencenter.org/audio-archive-project.html). But since Katagiri Roshi was a non-native English speaker, he can be difficult to understand. On this website, I carefully transcribe these talks as an aid to understanding them. You can read these transcripts on their own, or, ideally, follow along while listening to the recordings, which are referenced at the top of each talk. 

On close listening, it becomes apparent that Katagiri Roshi frequently backed up and corrected his choice of English words and grammar as he spoke. I attempt to apply his own in-stream self-corrections in a style of intelligent transcription. My intent is to stay as true as possible to Katagiri Roshi's actual, complete words, while also honoring what he was intending to say. This generally has the effect of smoothing out the grammar a bit, making the talks easier to read and understand. Each talk requires multiple listens over many hours to carefully transcribe in this way. That said, please be aware this entire transcript archive is an ongoing work in progress. No transcript here is every completely finished – the corrections just get smaller and less frequent. (I hope.)

Words where I am unsure of the best transcription, or where I am adding words to make the meaning more clear, are usually presented in brackets, [like this]. Significant nonverbal sounds are noted *[in brackets with italics]*. Sections that are unintelligible are marked *[unintelligible]*, or sometimes [...], depending on what makes the text more readable. And transcriber comments adding additional information are placed in parentheses, *(like this)*. The timecodes embedded in the transcripts generally serve as section breaks, in addition to helping match up the text to the audio recording.

With the assistance of the people who recorded and preserved the talks, and later those who put them online, Katagiri Roshi left behind – intentionally or not – what is essentially an online university in Soto Zen Buddhism, addressed to Americans. He makes connections to the whole of Buddhism, and to many topics in Western science and philosophy. But his primary focus is the teachings of Zen Master Eihei Dogen. 

With that in mind, one good entry point into this collection is the [Fundamentals of Zen](fundamentals) series. Beyond that, other fundamentals include the [*Bendowa* (“A Talk on Pursuing the Way”)](bendowa) series, the [Principles of Practice (*Gakudō-yōjinshū*)](principles-of-practice) series, and of course, *Fukanzazengi*, Dogen Zenji’s “Universal Recommendation for Zazen.” While we do not have all the talks that Katagiri Roshi gave specifically on *Fukanzazengi*, this lack is partly addressed by the [Annotated *Fukanzazengi*](annotated-fukanzazengi) found here.
