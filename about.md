# About This Website

These transcripts are compiled from talks in [The Dainin Katagiri Audio Archive](http://www.mnzencenter.org/katagiri_talks.php). For more information about Katagiri Roshi, visit [The Katagiri Project Home Page](http://www.mnzencenter.org/katagiri/). You can read these transcripts while listening to the audio recordings, which are referenced in each talk. 

This is an ongoing project. I am currently updating the talks Iâ€™ve already transcribed, and adding a glossary and various indices. After that I will get back to transcribing new talks.

These talks are transcribed by [Kikan Mike Howard](mailto:michaelhoward@mac.com)
