I’ve transcribed these talks from audio recordings in the online [Dainin Katagiri Audio Archive](http://www.mnzencenter.org/katagiri_talks.php). The talks are a treasure trove of [dharma](glossary#dharma) material, most of which is not found in [the five books](resources#katagiri-books) that have been compiled from Dainin Katagiri’s teachings. You can read the transcripts on their own, or follow along while listening to the recordings, which are referenced at the top of each talk. 

Katagiri Roshi’s energy, enthusiasm and humor come through even better in the audio than in print. On the other hand, he is a non-native English speaker with a Japanese accent, and the audio is of varying quality. So, he can be hard to understand. But really, more and more, I think the thing may be that these talks are rather dense: they are brimming over with vital information, which just flies by. These talks demand careful listening and serious reflection. I think the transcripts might help with that.

Each talk requires many hours to carefully transcribe. That said, there may still be inaccuracies. This is a work-in-progress. I am continually adding new transcripts and correcting existing ones.

I am transcribing these talks as a way of studying them myself. I've already found a lot here that is personally meaningful, even revolutionary. I hope you find something useful or inspiring here as well.

## Podcast Description

Dainin Katagiri Roshi was one of the prominent Zen masters who brought Soto Zen Buddhism from Japan to America. Audio recordings of his talks, recorded from 1979 to 1989, are made available by [Minnesota Zen Meditation Center](http://www.mnzencenter.org/katagiri_talks.php), but since he was a non-native speaker and the recording quality varied, he can be difficult to understand. Here these talks are carefully transcribed and read by second-generation student Kikan Michael Howard, with the intention of staying as true as possible to Katagiri Roshi's words, while smoothing out the grammar to make them easier to understand. 

New episodes of the podcast are on hold for now, while I focus on transcription.
