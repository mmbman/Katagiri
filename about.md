Dainin Katagiri Roshi was one of the prominent Zen masters who brought Soto Zen Buddhism from Japan to America. Audio recordings of his talks from 1979 to 1989 are made available by [Minnesota Zen Meditation Center](https://www.mnzencenter.org/audio-archive-project.html). But since Katagiri Roshi was a non-native English speaker – plus the original recordings on cassette tape vary in quality, and the MP3 audio files are sometimes severely over-compressed – he can be difficult to understand. On this website, I carefully transcribe these talks, as an aid to understanding them. You can read these transcripts on their own, or follow along while listening to the recordings, which are referenced at the top of each talk. 

On careful listening, it becomes apparent that Katagiri Roshi often backed up and corrected his choice of English words and grammar as he spoke. I attempt to apply his own in-stream self-corrections in a style of intelligent transcription. My intent is to stay as true as possible to Katagiri Roshi's actual words, while also honoring what he was *saying*. This generally has the effect of smoothing out the grammar a bit, making the talks slightly easier to read and understand. Words where I am unsure of the ideal transcription are usually presented in brackets, [like this].

These talks are a treasure trove of [dharma](glossary#dharma) material, most of which is not found in [the books](resources#katagiri-books) that have been compiled from Katagiri Roshi’s teachings. The talks also convey his energy, enthusiasm, and particularly, his sense of humor. But really, more and more, I think the thing may be that these talks are rather dense: they are brimming over with vital information, which flies by. These talks demand careful listening and serious reflection.

Each talk requires many hours and several listens to carefully transcribe. That said, there may still be inaccuracies. This is a work-in-progress.

I am transcribing these talks as a way of studying them myself. I've already found a lot here that is personally meaningful, even revolutionary. I hope you find something useful or inspiring here as well.
