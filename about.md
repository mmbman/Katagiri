# About This Website

I’ve transcribed these talks from audio recordings in the online [Dainin Katagiri Audio Archive](http://www.mnzencenter.org/katagiri_talks.php). You can read the transcripts while listening to the recordings, which are referenced in each talk. 

The talks are a treasure trove of [dharma](glossary#dharma) material, most of which cannot be found in the four books that have been compiled from Dainin Katagiri’s teachings. The transcripts can make it a lot easier to understand what he is saying. Katagiri’s energy, enthusiasm and humor come through in the audio even better than in print – but he is a non-native English speaker with a heavy Japanese accent, and the audio is of mediocre quality. Listen to a talk without a transcript, and you’ll probably see what I mean. 

Each talk requires many hours to properly transcribe. That said, there may still be inaccuracies.

This is an ongoing project. I am currently updating the talks I’ve already transcribed, and getting started on a glossary and various indices. After that I will get back to transcribing new talks.
