# About This Website

I’ve transcribed these talks from audio recordings in the online [Dainin Katagiri Audio Archive](http://www.mnzencenter.org/katagiri_talks.php). You can read the transcripts while listening to the recordings, which are referenced in each talk. 

For more information about Katagiri Roshi, visit [The Katagiri Project Home Page](http://www.mnzencenter.org/katagiri/). 

The talks seem to be a treasure trove of [dharma](glossary#dharma) material, most of which cannot be found in the four books that have been compiled from Dainin Katagiri’s talks. The transcripts can make it a lot easier to understand what he is saying. (Listen to a talk, and you’ll probably see what I mean.)

Each talk requires many hours to properly transcribe. That said, there may still be inaccuracies.

This is an ongoing project. I am currently updating the talks I’ve already transcribed, and getting started on a glossary and various indices. After that I will get back to transcribing new talks.
