# About This Website

I’ve transcribed these talks from recordings in the online [Dainin Katagiri Audio Archive](http://www.mnzencenter.org/katagiri_talks.php). You can read the transcripts while listening to the recordings, which are referenced in each talk.

For more information about Katagiri Roshi, visit [The Katagiri Project Home Page](http://www.mnzencenter.org/katagiri/). 

This is an ongoing project. I am currently updating the talks I’ve already transcribed, and adding a glossary and various indices. After that I will get back to transcribing new talks.

If you need to contact me with comments or questions, email: [Kikan Mike Howard](mailto:michaelhoward@mac.com)
