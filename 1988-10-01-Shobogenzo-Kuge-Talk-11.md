... *Sky* means, I mentioned, well, I mentioned the original energies of existence, original energies of being. 

Original energy of being is that which all living beings are supported by, upheld by. Consciously or unconsciously – complete beyond [their] control, our lives are supported by this. That is original, original, magnificent energy of being. Beyond past, present, future – that’s why later he mentions it is not matter of past, present, future. Wherever you may go, whoever you are, all living beings are supported by this. 

This is called sky. According to Buddhist philosophy it is called *emptiness*. 

In Japanese I think *sky* and *emptiness* are the same character, we use the same character. We say *sky*, this is we call *ku* or *sora* (空). But in Buddhist philosophy, emptiness is also same character we use. 

So original energy of being is emptiness, according to Buddhist philosophy. 

So what are they? What are they, we can see all living forms of phenomena. They are nothing but emptiness, activities of emptiness. In other words, original energies of being start to operate, then something happens, something occurs. This is called *form* – of trees, form of this is a tree, and this is a bird, and this is a water, this is a thought, and the mind, airs, many beings. Because when something is moving in dynamism and still, stillness means a state of being which it is moving at super-speed, it shows stillness. So moving in stillness, stillness in moving. Motion, we can say, dynamism. We can say so. 

Anyway, when something is moving in dynamism, always something happens. Something happens in the time process. That’s why it says *time*; time is always arises. Now what is time? Time is just arises, just arise. 

Dogen Zenji mentions in this book, if you read “Ocean Seal Samadhi” in this book – “Ocean Seal Concentration,” page 76. He talks about time, he talks about dharma. And finally, if you research deeply the time, characteristic of time, it becomes just arise, in motion. But that arising is very pure motion. That’s why he says, “arising never leaves anything behind arising.” So very pure activity. Very pure activity. 

Just like a dancer, always moving her or his hands, constantly, beyond calculation, beyond the good or bad, right or wrong. According to the teacher’s suggestions, they are always moving. Within their movement, there is no guarantee whether she or he will be a good dancer or not, but [still] they do. That is kind of, uh, innocent activity. *[He laughs.]* Innocent activity. Do you understand? We call it neutral activity, according to Buddhist psychology. 

So if you go to the depths of existence, you can see this kind of activity, that is [completely] pure, very pure. So that pure arising always creating something. So that is this world, this world that we can see. 

So the world, phenomena, all phenomena, myriad, myriad things you can see are nothing but original energy of being. That’s it. 

So original energy of being is simultaneously all phenomena. No gap between. 

That is called flowers in the sky. 

So this original energy of being is called sometimes Buddha or buddha-nature. 

So let’s read this paragraph once again. 

> In so far as enlightenment is a *cataract*, ...

Cataract means corresponding to human consciousness. If you see human consciousness, we know pretty well human consciousness never gets anything as it truly is. So always perverted; we get it, simultaneously something is twisted, very quickly, at the super-speed. That is the movement of consciousness, so called *ignorance*. We call it ignorance. 

In Japanese *ignorance* is called *mumyo* (無明) which means “unclearness.” *Unclearness* means you don’t know, you don’t know why you create this. You don’t know why consciousness moves. Before you think or after you think, beyond your thinking, it’s already there. ‘
‘
So in *The Awakening of Faith* it says ignorance is beginningless. Because we don’t know from where it comes. 

But it has an end; so it’s not endless. But it’s beginningless. That means we don’t know from where it comes. So if you don’t know from where it comes, you should keep your mouth shut and just accept and see, see the situation, see the present atmosphere of your existence as clear as you can, and accept it, and work on it. That’s all we have to do. But we are always trying to know from where it comes first, and *then* I can deal with my life, et cetera. That’s why human beings are always creating problems. Because they don’t accept the reality as it is. 

So that’s why Buddhism constantly talks about reality. It’s not the mental fascination, it’s not the spiritual “trip.” You like very much spiritual trip. *[He chuckles.]* But if you take a spiritual trip for long, you become crazy, you know? *[A couple people laugh.]* So I think your life must be rooted on the ground, and then you can see really something deep. And then you can help, you can help anybody, even though you don’t talk. 

But in the other way you can help, but that help is, I don’t know how much you help. That help is very shaky. Today you can help somebody, but next day you cannot help. And then you can help today and that person is so happy and appreciative to you, but next day that person hates you. That kind of [thing] always happens. So what are you doing. Is it really help? Yes, in a sense, [it is] help, but in a sense help is always hurting. Not always helping, hurting people. 

So that’s why we always think we want to help somebody, we like doing this very much, but if you start to practice, it’s very difficult. You can notice. 

So cataract consciousness is very minute vibration of consciousness. This is a cataract. That’s why by this minute vibration of consciousness we can see everything twisted. That’s what Buddhism generally says. That is called *kuge*, flower in the sky. 

That’s why you have to remove delusions and ignorance: *then* you can see something as it is. But, I don’t know, you can do it or not. 

So “in so far as enlightenment is a cataract” – so in this case enlightenment is a cataract because the enlightenment, delusions, and cushions, and cups, and grasses, are all phenomena. Are coming from, not coming, which are exactly identical with the activities of great energy of being. 

In other words, I mentioned before: “I practice *sesshin*. I attend to practice *sesshin*.” Who makes the decision of attending to this sesshin? *I* did. But *I* did, this I is very small portion of a decision, because my decision is very small, very shaky. So the moment when I attended *sesshin*, next moment I hate sesshin, so I want to escape. So that is not exactly perfect decision. 

So enlightenment and all phenomena are exactly identical with original energy of being. No gap between. From this point, Katagiri is Katagiri’s activity, Katagiri’s gassho, Katagiri’s activity of bodhi-mind is nothing but activity of original energy of being called the Buddha. So Buddha does it, Buddha does zazen, and then Buddha lets the flower of zazen blooms, so called shikan, sitting right now. So that is result. 

So Buddha appears, and Buddha works, and Buddha forms the fruit. In other words, Buddha becomes Buddha. 

So Katagiri is what? Katagiri is Katagiri, but that is a small portion of understanding. So Katagiri is actually in terms of universal perspective is Buddha, original energy of being. 

So, why do I do zazen? Because I am Buddha, so Buddha does zazen, so I and Buddha are completely one. If so, by the practice of zazen what do I want? Katagiri becomes Katagiri, that’s it. Do you understand? 

So that’s why in zazen, *Zazengi* says “no intention of becoming Buddha.” So nothing to think, nothing to expect, nothing to hate, nothing to throw away, nothing to get into, nothing to go out. All you have to do is to be right there. 

Who is there? You are there. You are Buddha. So Buddha [is] there. 

So who is Buddha? Buddha is me. So I am there. 

So if I am doing zazen, then I become Buddha. That means I become I. So-called Katagiri becomes Katagiri. Katagiri becomes Buddha who is really Katagiri, who is really confirmed, stable existence. Being. With no comparison around me. Just sit down there. 

That is called *enlightenment*, we call that enlightenment. So if you sit zazen properly with wholeheartedness, then you become you, that is you are Buddha. Then you always show, manifest enlightenment. 

So the moment when the enlightenment is manifested, it is nothing but the cataract, because you can sit, you can experience it. So enlightenment is one of your experiences through your six senses. So it’s cataract. Do you understand? 

Next moment, you love it, you love enlightenment, you attach to it. Then enlightenment turns into delusion. But delusion is also same thing as enlightenment. 

*[He chuckles.]*

You should see those events, always events occur in the realm of zazen. Enlightenment means a wonderful thing. Next moment, not wonderful thing. But from where do they come? Do you create them? Oh of course you create them, in a sense, but actually you don’t. Your effort is a very small portion of the effort. The active great effort is in the balance, and then it’s coming up. That’s why if you sit down, you don’t know from where energy is coming up. Sometimes you jump up. Do you understand? Have you ever experienced? And sometimes many thoughts coming up, which you have never thought before. So, many things happen. 

So that is created by you? Yes, or not. Because it is some thought. Some thought is a thought you can see, but it’s not a thought you can see, it is something more than thought you can see. Because it is nothing but original activity of energies. That energy coming up at certain circumstances which is wonderful feeling, at that time it is called “enlightenment”; we can put the name on it. And then in the realm of not feeling good, that is, that original energy is called “delusions.” So what’s the difference between delusions and enlightenment? All are cataracts. 

So all are cataracts. If so, you have to deal with [them]. How can you do it? All are the same. sS you have to just sit down there with calm mind. Don’t be carried away by enlightenment or delusions. Just sit down there and work on it. Accept this enlightenment, delusions and work on them one by one. 

Just like holding a bunch of thread with knots. You know? Holding. That is called “to deal with all things as a Buddha.” 

So that’s why when you go to the toilet, you have to deal with the toilet as a Buddha. So gassho, this is a manifestation, whole manifestation of Buddha, Buddha’s world. 

But we always think, if you see your intellectual understanding, the toilet is some dirty place. So you don’t appreciate it. Only you appreciate something beautiful. But without toilet, how can you survive? No way. 

So toilet is what? Cataracts. Urine is cataracts. So all are Buddha. So we have to deal with them as a Buddha. 

That is here it says, “in so far as enlightenment is a cataract, ...”

> ... the myriad elements of enlightenment are all elements of a magnificent array of *cataracts*, ...

That means, first we can see the cataract, and then at that time your consciousness starts to move, so-called based on like or dislike. “Oh, it’s cataract, I don’t like it.” For instance, even though you hear this Buddha’s teaching [that] toilet is Buddha’s world, so you should get into the toilet with no vibration of consciousness by which you can create like or dislike. So just get in and *gassho*. Then we do it. *[He laughs.]* But immediately you can, “Oh. Stink.” You can think. Immediately you hate it. So like, dislike coming up. 

But if you understand, if you practice like this, next moment you can immediately come back to the original energy of being. And then you can accept cataract. At that time, that cataract is magnificent ornament of the cataracted world, so-called Buddha’s world. 

So “the myriad elements of enlightenment are all enlightenment’s magnificent array of cataracts, ...” 

> ... the myriad elements of delusion are all elements of a grandiose array of cataracts. 

So that same thing. Is that clear? 
 
#### 22:55

Next, 

> For now we should say that since cataracted eyes are equal, flowers in the sky are equal; ...
 
So flowers and cataracted eyes are same, because flowers are emptiness, original energy of existence. And then eyes consciousness, one of the phenomena. So cataracted eyes are the same as the trees, birds and human beings [that] you can see. So cataracted eyes are equal, flowers in the sky are equal. So emptiness and flowers always blooming in the realm of sky, so-called emptiness. Emptiness is dynamic activities, creating something constantly. Origination and extinction, origination and extinction, always happens. 

> ... since cataracted eyes are birthless, flowers in the sky are birthless. 

So from this point, Dogen Zenji mentioned, just arising never leaves anything behind arising, because this activity called arising is very pure. That is called *birthless*. 

It’s coming up, but it’s not [...] something you can see or you can pin down. So it appears, but you cannot see. But it’s helping, actually, everyday life. 

So that’s why “cataracted eyes are birthless” means cataracted eyes, all you can see, many things you can see are not something wrong. They are nothing but Buddha’s world, Buddha’s beings always arising. 

So that is birthless, flowers in the sky are also birthless...

> Since all things are characteristics of reality, ...

“Reality” means capital R, real reality. Thusness, and suchness. 

So since all things are characteristics of thusness or Reality with capital R, 

> cataract flowers are characteristics of reality.

So from this point, if all things are thusness and [suchness] or reality as it is, I think flowers in the sky, all sentient beings are the same things. 

[...]

Simply speaking this is called *jissō shohō*. *Jissō* means all things are reality with capital R. All things are reality as it truly is. So that is called the technical term *shohō jissō*, usually we use “reality.” But I think you should use “Reality” with a capital R. Sometimes “real reality” we use, or “true reality.” 

So everything is arising and perishing in the realm of real reality or true reality. So from this point, they arise, but they don’t say they arise, because they just arise. If you do *gassho*, you do *gassho*, but you don’t say “I am doing *gassho*,” you just do *gassho*. This is called just arising. This is called pure activity, undefiled activity, arising constantly in the realm of true reality. So just do; continuation of pure activity. 

**Question:** Are the cataracts *defiled* activities *[unintelligible]*?

**Katagiri Roshi:** No. No.

No. Cataracted eyes are also nothing but the beings. But cataract, if you believe, why Dogen has to say like this, because if we are always looking at or think of anything in the common sense of duality, at that time, cataract, if you get the word cataract: “oh, that sickness.” Then sickness creates, that is a judgment. After judgment, next, affective preferences coming up, then like or dislike. So if you use “cataract”: “Oh, sickness. Oh, I don’t like it,” this automatically is coming up. Then finally you are completely tossed away by the automatic activity of your thinking mind, consciousness. And then you are completely far from the beginning. That’s why we have to *come back* to the beginning, original energy. That is our practice, constantly. In everyday life. That’s why even though you don’t understand, you have to understand this one. And through the studying, and also sitting zazen, and then in everyday life we practice coming back, coming back, again and again, to this first point. And then cataract *is* accepted as a Buddha, smoothly. Like holding a bunch of [fruit], softly, compassionately. And then you can work on the cataract, without creating like or dislike. Do you understand? 

Like or dislike, emotional, psychological [affliction] is coming from like or dislike. So that we always add this extra problem into materialistical physical problem. And then the problem becomes very complicated. It’s like a [fall]. Completely we don’t know how to get up. 

And that’s why we have to constantly have to say, “[...] cataract is Buddha.” We don’t believe it, but this is actually true. That’s why we have to listen to again and again this one, “Cataract *is* Buddha.” Then, finally, you can accept it. And then work on it with compassion, patience... and you can share, naturally. 

Is that clear? 

**Question:** *[unintelligible]*

**Katagiri Roshi:** Well because Buddha appears in every different circumstances, appears. Means when you do *gassho*, this is a *gassho*. *Gassho*, Buddha appears. “Buddha appears” means that *gassho* is very pure, originally. That is I do this *gassho* now. But the moment when I do it, this *gassho* is handled with my, well, something. And then *gassho* is, well I doubt it. Why do I have to do that? Something like that. So finally you cannot carry the *gassho* on and on. So finally you quit. That happens. 

So Buddha appears in each realm of a moment – very myriad, myriad aspects of the moment. *Gassho*, washing of face, and many things. Then it appears. That is for our activities. At that time, from the beginning to end, for our practice we have to deal with this *gassho* as a Buddha, from the beginning to end. Whatever my head thinks. Do you understand? Otherwise *gassho* is twisted. 

Well twisted *gassho* is also cataract, so it’s not a problem. That’s why keep your mind calm, and realize it! Awaken it. And then next moment there is a possibility to deal with anything as a Buddha. Okay? 

But if you make a mistake, immediately we create a psychological [affliction], like or dislike. Then constantly we are creating problems. 

Well constantly we have to remember this point and come back to practically, and then deal with the object and our life. This is the point Dogen Zenji mentions. 

#### 33:24

“Cataract flowers are characteristic of reality...” 

> It’s not a question of past, present, and future, not a matter of beginning, middle, and end...

Beyond the past, present, future. It’s not a matter of past, present, future. Because billions and billions of years ago, the world is the same. Anyway same according to original energy of existence, same thing. 

So that is constantly working. That’s why the moon, the sun, the stars, they exist. And human beings also exist and the trees exist. Same thing. No change. Always there. 

So that is completely beyond the idea of past, present, future. Because past, present, future is already – what would you say – the idea we human beings create. Which means to chop off time. *[He laughs.]* 

And also it’s not a matter of beginning, middle, and end. We have to anyway deal with something from the beginning to end in the same attitude. When you feel enlightenment, that is fine, but still you have to sit down and deal with enlightenment with calm mind. Next moment, you can see delusion, but you should deal with it in the same attitude as enlightenment. 

This is very important. “Same attitude” means not mixed up, when you deal with delusion and enlightenment. Same attitude means calm mind. Anyway calm mind. Be quiet and sit down there and open your eyes and see what’s going on there. That is the same attitude, basic attitude towards human life. Then, you can deal with different as they really are. Tree is different from Katagiri; Katagiri is different from bell. So very naturally, you can deal with it. 

And next, 

> — because they are not blocked by origination and destruction, they are able to cause origination and destruction to be originated and destroyed. 

I think before I mention this point. In Buddhism I think the Dogen Zenji mentions, if you don’t believe moment, instant, it’s very difficult for us to arouse bodhi-mind. Maybe so, maybe it is true. 

So *moment* is, in terms of modern physics I think the most shortest period of time they found. But in Buddhism still to 2500 years ago already they found the short period of moment and time. That is Dogen Zenji mentions in Shobogenzo, I think it’s [6,400,099,180] instants a day. A day! 

And he mentions also one moment consists of 70 instants. 

So it’s a pretty deep understanding of time. But now modern physics is much more shortest period of time. Then by this we can go to the moon, anyway. *[He laughs.]* But anyway, in ancient time Buddhists don’t use modern physics, any machines or computers... only by zazen, and they can notice this moment, and trip to the moon. They trip to the moon! Yes, they did. But not the airplane. *[He laughs.]* Not the motor machine. They did. Anyway they know; they know the moon. That’s why the moon is beautiful. 

But now in the modern physics we can go, but the moon is not beautiful. [Only a] machine, kind of part of machine of the universe. So that’s interesting. In ancient time they don’t know the machines but they know the moon, then the moon becomes beautiful. But now, I don’t know. That’s questionable. 

So if you go to see this moment, I think the last 70th instant of a second, I think that is very pure. You don’t know who created this. We don’t know how this last 70th moment was created. We don’t know. Because it is simultaneously eternity. That last 70th moment is a moment which occupies time and space, a portion of time and space, but simultaneously it goes beyond this. So it’s no time. So very naturally it means at that time, that moment,is a moment, but it’s not the moment, it’s something which has a great energy to create next new things. So, moment creates moment. That’s it. 

That’s why here it says, “they are not blocked by origination and destruction, they are able to cause origination and destruction to be originated and destroyed.”

So by themselves they create new life and perish. That happens. 

So at that time, who creates this world? *[He chuckles.]* [...] We don’t know who. 

I talked [about] this one day at the conference of Christianity and Buddhism, and one of the fathers asked me, “who made that last moment of the instant?” I said “that last moment and last 70th instant makes new 70th instant.” So in other words, simply speaking, moment creates moment, that’s it. That is our original energies, so-called Buddha, buddha-nature, or universe, we can say. 

> They originate in the sky and perish in the sky, originate in cataracts and perish in the cataracts, originate in flowers and perish in the flowers. All other times and places are also like this.

I would like to go a little more, but well, let’s end. Do you have a question? 

#### 42:36

**Question:** samsara ... origination cycling. Does that come to bear here? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yes. Samsara comes from this energies. 

That’s why samsara is a place where Shakyamuni Buddha should be. That’s it. Buddhist scripture says, not other world. That’s why samsara is important for us.

*[Tape change.]*

#### 43:10

... or just accept it, but I think... 

**Question:** But it doesn’t mean you don’t work with it. It means...

**Katagiri Roshi:** You should work, you should work. Yeah, “accept it” doesn’t mean nothing to work. You should work on it. 

But a point is, original attitude is important toward that. If you see delusions, I mentioned already, like or dislike coming up. If you create like or dislike, you don’t deal with the delusions with compassion; you cannot accept it. So very naturally you will always separate, or kick it out. In many ways – softly or harshly, we do it. But I think to accept the delusion is before you create like or dislike. Anyway, please receive this one, and then work on it. 

But on the other hand, we cannot ignore the consciousness creating always like or dislike immediately. I mentioned when you get into the toilet, immediately we don’t like it, because very stinky. But that is our customs, habit. So we try to polish this custom, habit. Habits and custom is important; that’s why we should polish it. Then, if you feel, “oh, stinky” – please calm my mind, stand up, let’s do *gassho* and bow. And then use it. This is our practice. 

Okay? 

#### 44:04

**Question:** But I’m having a little trouble figuring out where the element of [choice] comes in. [...] Because if I don’t like the psychological turmoil created by like and dislike... 

**Katagiri Roshi:** *[Laughs.]*

**Questioner:** So I would rather return to silence, but there’s still like and dislike there.

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yes, there. But I think there is actually, strictly speaking, no choice. Strictly; because this is original life. Do you understand? No choice. Absolutely no choice. Okay? 

Then that’s why your life, unconsciously or consciously, you accept your life with no excuse. That’s why many life coming up from you. Do you understand? 

If you can’t choice originally, you cannot enjoy your life. Because you can be born in the heaven. In the heaven, it’s paradise. Whatever you want, it immediately appears. If you don’t like it, it disappears, naturally. So at that time, it’s comfortable, it’s wonderful, rich, you know. Million years become, you become million years, but no fun. No enjoyment. But you enjoy with, not only happiness, but also unhappiness. You enjoy your life with happiness and unhappiness. Psychologically or physically. Because you accept your life totally with no choice. That’s why many life coming up. So you should appreciate this life. 

That’s why I say, you have to accept those myriad, myriad cataract flowers, flowers in the cataracted eyes. Okay? 

#### 47:29

**Question:** Two choices... *inaudible* You told me once not to worry, you

**Katagiri Roshi:** *[Laughs.]* Yeah, you never die. Yes. Even though you die – you never die. 

I think there are two choices, I say. At that time, you are arrogant there, because you try to deal your life by your effort, by your knowledge, by your power, by your capability. That’s it. Always there is. Then, when you are in front of difficulties, very naturally, you want to do something by your power, always. Okay? But actually, it’s a very small world. Because you need lots of help, and psychologies, and religions, and philosophies. And then you can go to the psychologist, and then you can get some help. But still, it’s not exactly perfect solution. Still confusions and suffering there. 

So finally, you scream, and you hate your suffering, and then finally you bump your head against a big pole. And then, there is no way to go. Then you say, “Okay, what should I do? Should I survive, shall I live, or shall I die?” That’s it. 

But world is your life seen from you, but simultaneously life seen in the universal perspective. At that time, life is big. Life is completely depending on something not only you. So, life is yours, but simultaneously you should have a little tolerance, and patience, and compassion, enough to let your life depend on something big world. Do you understand? 

In other words, yesterday I mentioned the way you are, right in the middle of the ocean, thrown by somebody over the boat. At that time, a huge ocean, right in the middle of the ocean, no boat, nothing. Now what do you do? What do you do? This is each of us, situation is exactly each of us. 

Of course you have to deal with your life by your effort. Yes, you swim. You have to swim. But you cannot swim constantly only by your power. Because there is an ocean. There is an ocean. First you have to really depend on the ocean first, with relaxation and assurance of your existence. And then you can swim. That means you have to offer your body and mind to the ocean. And then you can swim. 

That kind of practice is important. That’s why Dogen Zenji mentioned, if you throw away [into] Buddha’s house, then no need of your effort, and then the energy comes from the Buddha – something like that. You can read the translation of Shobogenzo, title is “Life and Death.” 

So that means you have to really offer your body and life to the ocean’s life. Then, your life is handled. That is most important, we should practice in everyday life. If you don’t understand, always remember that analogy. It’s a very good analogy. I always think in this way. When I particularly am right in the middle of suffering. *[He laughs.]* Where am I? I am in the ocean. What should I do? I am screaming – yes, ok, that’s up to you. But no one comes, so what should I do next? Cry? Yes, that’s up to you, you can cry, but nothing happens. No one can hear my crying. What should I do? So finally, keep my mind sharp. My mind sharp and just be, and swim. That’s it. That’s all I have to continue to do it, day to day. 

That’s not fun, is it? *[He laughs.]*

**Questioner:** What do you mean by “I’ll never die”? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Oh, never die. If you live in that way, even though your body dies, you never die. Because you are exactly tuned into that rhythm of the universe. 

But your body is perished. Mind is gone. But it doesn’t matter; that is our speculation. Mind, body, tuning in, anyway, tuning in the rhythm of the river of universe. That’s it. 

**Questioner:** So if you jump into the ocean while you’re alive, then you never die. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yeah, never die. Yes, you can completely give your life to the ocean. At that time your life dies. Do you understand that one? If you completely open and give your life to the ocean, you must die. But when you die, you are alive. 

That is day to day, we have to practice. It’s not mystical thinking, physical thinking – “after death I am not dying,” it doesn’t mean this. 

(inaudible) 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yes. Give up. But still, [if you] completely give up, at that time, that past, your karma, blooms the new life of their own. 

(inaudible) 

Yeah. Of their karma. New karma is coming up. 

They don’t remain in the same form, what they were. So when you completely give up and give it to the ocean, then all karma blooms in a new way. 

That is *survival* – arising, arising.
