### Summary

Katagiri Roshi completely explains the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination... probably, but the audio is lost. There is substantial coverage of the topic in the following talks in this series. Still, we would really like to retrieve this talk someday, if possible.

### Transcript

*(Archive Issue: The online audio of this talk is only about five minutes long: apparently the first side of the tape may have been blank, or some processing error occurred. This is unfortunate, to say the least. However, the next talk picks up after this one.)*

#### start of recording

… the words come up. And then, now can people look at this form of circle? And then how do they agree with this existence of a form of circle coming from a movement? How? Just the words. Without words, we cannot get agreement. Don’t you think so?

So what is agreement? “Oh yes, it is the form of a circle” – this is nothing but the agreement consisting of the words. [Or,] “Katagiri, you’re bad boy.” “Yes.” How can you agree? This agreement is just words. 

But this agreement is also important for us, okay? Don’t misunderstand. I don’t mean you should ignore agreement. Agreement is important. But you should know what [is the] component factor of agreement. Agreement is also that you accept your life completely with total agreement. Even though you like or you dislike, you accept already. So, you should know what is the component factor of agreement. Your body and your mind is what? Just words. We accept through words. What words? Five [skandhas](glossary#skandha), and [karma](glossary#karma), and *cetanā*, mind. That is Buddhist psychology, which is called [*Abhidharma*](glossary#abhidharma)*. *[He chuckles]* It’s huge. It takes ten years to master it. If you don’t believe it, I will show it, I will explain it. *[He laughs.]* But if you want to study it, you should go to San Francisco Zen Center; they teach the Abhidharma. Huge. But interesting, very interesting.

**Question**: Are there any stories in the Abhidharma about the beginning of time and space, and ignorance?

**Katagiri**: The beginning of time and space... *[He laughs.]* It’s already ignorance. *[Laughter.]* 

The beginning of time and space is already ignorance, coming from your consciousness, don’t you think so? If you say *before*, already there is *after*, don’t you think? So already you think something – “time and space” – in the [dualistic](glossary#dualistic) sense: before and after, separate. But what is “before”? What is “after”? That is a very interesting, huge, system: [psychology] and theology. 

What is the first beginning of the world? Who created it? That’s interesting. *[He chuckles.]* Buddha did it? Or before [Shakyamuni Buddha](glossary#shakyamuni-buddha ), who are his teachers? Do you know that? Always we research, poke... investigate. So Buddha says, “Oh yes, I [had teachers].” Buddha [is] very straightforward: before Buddha Shakyamuni was born in this world, already thousands of Buddhas existed. [Thousands of years] before Buddha was born, [there’s] already [a] Buddha. And then he communicated with him and practiced under him, and then he became a Buddha. And then in the future, how can the Buddha transmit his teachings, when [Buddhism](glossary#buddhism) is completely destroyed? That is Maitreya Buddha. So that is really Buddhology: systemized, before and after. But, it’s important.

So before time and space is completely no sense of [ignorance]. This is *[unintelligible]* the Buddhas. That is the truth – regardless of whether the Buddha was [creating] this world, or he describes those forms, or not. Anyway, this is before time and space arises.
