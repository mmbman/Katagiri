## Summary

Katagiri Roshi completely explains the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination, presumably... but the audio is lost. However, there is some review of the topic in the next talk.

## Transcript

(Transcriber’s Note: The online audio of this first talk is only about five minutes long: apparently the first side of the tape may have been blank, or some processing error occurred. This is unfortunate, to say the least. However, the talk from the following day picks up after this one.)

**This transcript is in rough draft stage.**

… the words come up. And then, now everyone, can people look at this form of circles(?). And then how do they agree with this existence of a form of circle, coming from a movement. How? Just words. Without words, we cannot get our agreement. Don’t you think so?

So what is agreement? Oh yes, it is a form of a circle. This is nothing but the agreement consists of the words. “Katagiri, you’re bad boy.” Yes. How can you agree? This agreement is just words. But this agreement is also important for us, okay? Don’t misunderstand. I don’t mean you should ignore agreement. Agreement is important. But you should know what component factor of agreement. Agreement is also that you accept your life completely with total agreement. Even though you like or you dislike, you accept already. So, you should know what is the component factor of agreement. Your body and your mind is what? Just words. We accept through words. What’s words? Five [skandhas](glossary#skandha). There’s [karma](glossary#karma), and *[unintelligible]*, mind. That is Buddhist Psychology, which is called *Abhidharma*. It’s huge. It takes ten years to master it. *[He laughs.]* If you don’t believe, I will show it, I will explain it. But if you want to study it, you should go to San Francisco Zen Center; they teach [Abhidharma](glossary#abhidharma). Huge. But interesting, very interesting.

**Question**: Are there any stories in the [Abhidharma](glossary#abhidharma) about the beginning of time and space, and ignorance?

**Katagiri**: The beginning of time and space... *[He laughs.]* It’s already ignorance. *[Laughter.]* The beginning of time and space is already ignorance, coming from your consciousness, don’t you think so? If you say “before”, already there is “after”, don’t you think? So already you think something, “time and space,” in the [dualistic](glossary#dualistic) sense: before and after, separate. But what is “before”? What is that “after”? That is a very interesting, huge, system: [psychology] and theology. So what is the first beginning of the world? Who creates it? That’s interesting. Buddha did it? Or before [Shakyamuni Buddha](glossary#shakyamuni-buddha ), who are his teachers? Do you know that? Always we research, poke... investigate. So Buddha says, “Oh yes, I have.” So Buddha anyway, very straightforward: two thousand years before Buddha Shakyamuni was born in this world, already thousands of Buddhas existed. That is Maitreya Buddha… No, not Maitreya … I forgot the [Sanskrit](glossary#sanskrit) name. But three thousands years ago, before Buddha was born, it’s already Buddha. And then he communicated with him and practiced under him, and then he became a Buddha. And then in the future, how can the Buddha transmit his teachings, when [Buddhism](glossary#buddhism) is completely destroyed? That is Maitreya Buddha. *[Unintelligible.]* So that is really Buddhology: systemized, before and after. But, it’s important.

So before time and space is completely normal sense of ignorance. This is [the birth] of the Buddhas. That is the truth, regardless of whether the Buddha was [speaking] this word, or he describes the forms, or not. Anyway, this is before time and space arises.
