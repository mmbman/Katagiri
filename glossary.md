The titles for these discourses are taken from [“Dōgen’s Extensive Record: A Translation of the Eihei Kōroku,”](books#eihei-koroku) translated by Taigen Dan Leighton and Shohaku Okumura. The titles did not originate with Dōgen, but are useful for reference.

## Prajñāpāramitā

"Wisdom beyond wisdom", or The Perfection of Wisdom.

Prajñāpāramitā means "the Perfection of (Transcendent) Wisdom" in Mahāyāna Buddhism. Prajñāpāramitā refers to this perfected way of seeing the nature of reality, as well as to a particular body of sutras and to the personification of the concept in the Bodhisattva known as the "Great Mother" (Tibetan: Yum Chenmo). The word Prajñāpāramitā combines the [Sanskrit](glossary#sanskrit) words prajñā "wisdom" with pāramitā "perfection". Prajñāpāramitā is a central concept in Mahāyāna Buddhism and is generally associated with the doctrine of emptiness (śūnyatā) or 'lack of Svabhava' (essence) and the works of Nāgārjuna. Its practice and understanding are taken to be indispensable elements of the Bodhisattva path.

According to [Edward Conze](glossary#edward-conze), the Prajñāpāramitā Sutras are "a collection of about forty texts ... composed somewhere on the Indian subcontinent between approximately 100 BC and AD 600."[1] Some Prajnāpāramitā sūtras are thought to be among the earliest Mahāyāna sūtras.[2][3]

## Primitive Buddhism

Katagiri Roshi sometimes uses them term "Primitive Buddhism" – possibly to refer to early Buddhist teachings, which were probably heavily influenced by [Brahmanism](glossary#brahmanism) in India. Or, it might refer to Pre-sectarian Buddhism, "Buddhism as theorized to have existed before the various subsects of Buddhism came into being"  – which is not exactly the same thing. Either way, it is something somewhat distinct from [Mahayana Buddhism](glossary#mahayana). However, the term is probably not meant to be perjorative; Katagiri often mentions that we need to understand our Zen practice in terms of general Buddhism, "mentioned by Buddha."

I'm tracking references to "Primitive Buddhism" to try to get a better sense of what Katagiri Roshi does mean (because it's pretty interesting).
