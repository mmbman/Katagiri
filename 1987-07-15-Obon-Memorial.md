The topic tonight is about *Bon* celebration, which is one of the annual customs in Buddhism in Japan and China. 

The origin of the *Bon* celebration, the word *Bon* is *Ullambana*. [Here it says] *Ullambana* means “hanging upside down,” denoting that the people in the state of Pratahamnidavus or Kaki-do have as much suffering and pain as if they were hanging upside down. That is the meaning of Ullambana. U-L-L-A-M-B-A-N-A Ullambana. In Japanese we say *Ura-Bon*. 

So *Bon* is the time for paying respect and practicing dana. To the departed, it is the time to express our concern and gratitude to the departed so that they will continue to rest in peace. The Bon service is held once a year during the month of July on the 15th or August 15th. 

So today I would like to introduce the Buddhist Sutra from where this Bon Ullambana service originated. It is a very short sutra I translated this time. So if you study this sutra I think you can understand the meaning of Ullambana service. This is the first draft of my translation of the sutra, *[he laughs, and the audience laughs a little,]* so it is not a good translation, but anyway probably you will understand the meaning. First I will read it. 

The title of this sutra is Ullambana Sutra, Delivered by the Buddha. It was translated into Chinese by Dharmarakṣa, who lived from 231 to 308, so almost the 4th century. 

> And thus have I heard. When the Buddha was at Jetavana-vihāra, at Shrāvastī in [Koshara] in India. Mogallana ...

Mogallana was one of the ten major Buddhist disciples. 

> Mogallana had the first experience of the six-fold super power. On account of being amply requited of the debt of his parent's mercy and kindness he observed closely the world with his spiritual eye. He found his departed mother being in the hungry realm where there was no food and no drink. She was reduced to a bag of skin and bones. Mogallana with grief in his heart went to see her to offer food filled in a bowl. The mother held the whole bowl in her left hand and took some food with her right hand. The food turned to fire before it touched her mouth, so she wouldn't result in having any food at all. Mogallana showed his deep grief and well and hastened back to the Buddha to describe in detail what had happened. 
>
> The Buddha said, “The root of the transgressions that your dear mother committed are so grave that it is beyond your power to save her from her suffering. Even though you have filial piety enough to tremble heaven and earth, heavenly gods, guardians of the ground, devils, people who follow other teachings, and the gods in the four directions are of no use. She will surely be liberated, however, if through the majestic influence of the assembly in the ten directions. I now speak of a teaching of salvation and let all suffering sufferers be free from their difficulties.”
>
> The Buddha also said to Mogallana, “On the occasion of Pavarana ...”

Pavarana means... well later I will explain. 

> ... “On the occasion of Pavarana on the 15th of July, the last day of the summer training period, if there are your present parents and ancestral parents for seven generations who are confronted with their difficulties, you should pay homage to the great venerable monks in the ten directions with offerings of rice and various delicious food, the five kinds of fruits, water prevailing in the universe, incense and candle lights, spreading carpets on the floor, putting all different kinds of dainties in the world on the tray. On this day, among all sacred assemblies, some are monks who have attained the four stages of Zen practice in the forest or mountains. Some are *shravaka* and *pratyekabuddha* who have attained the six super powers by which they can freely edify people. Some are the great enlightened bodhisattvas who have attained the ten stages of bodhisattvas’ practice. Some are with all other assemblies as monks. They all together have received the same contented food, the same pure precepts, and been endowed with the path of the sacred monk's life and vastness of their virtue. If you pay homage to these Pavarana monks with offerings, the present parents, the parents of seven generations, the six relatives and the whole families are able to free themselves from the sufferings in the river of the three crossings, to be liberated according to circumstances, and spontaneously to receive clothes and food. If the parents are alive, they deserve to receive bliss and joy for a hundred years. The parents for seven generations are qualified to be born in the heaven, to be reincarnated freely and to have boundless joy adorned with heavenly flowers.” 
>
> One day the Buddha told implicitly to the assemblies in the ten directions, “First of all, pray for the family of donors, particularly for the parents for seven generations, with the spirit of dhyana, concentration or meditation, and receive food afterward. When you have food, first be present peacefully in the stupa in the presence of the Buddha, and eat food after all assemblies pray in the presence of the Buddha.” In that moment, Mogallana and all monks, all Bodhisattvas feel rejoiced because Mogallana's grief and well are removed with sudden illumination. 
> 
> On this day, his mother is liberated for a long period of time from the sufferings of hungry spirit. Mogallana also said to the Buddha, “The mothers who gave birth to the Buddha's disciples are bestowed with the virtuous strength of the three treasures and the majestic power of all assemblies. Is it possible for all the Buddha's disciples to observe the practice of Ullambana ritual in the future for the sake of saving their present parents and their parents for seven generations from their sufferings?” The Buddha said, “That's a good idea. It's a good question, because that is all I wanted to speak of it. You have just now asked about it.” He continued to say, “All good family and friends, if anyone of monks, nuns, kings, princes, ministers, prime ministers, the three officers, other officers, the whole nation, and the common people show their compassionate piety in practice for the present parents and parents for seven generations, you should pay homage to the Pavarana monks with various dainties on the tray on the occasion of the Buddha's rejoicing day, July 15th, when they observe the Pavarana practice. You should pray for the present parents and the parents for the past seven generations to be free from the sufferings in the state of hungry spirit and to receive bliss and joy without any sickness for a century, without being afflicted with any sufferings. In order to observe the practice of filial piety as a Buddhist disciple, you should be mindful of the parents and the parents of seven generations at every single moment of thought, and show filial compassion on the 15th of July every year. You should be ample requital of the debt of your parents' nursing kindness and love, by merits of performing the Ullambana practice, in the mindfulness of the parents with offerings to the buddhas and the monks. Thus, all Buddha’s disciples should respectfully keep this teaching.”
>
> At that moment, Mogallana and all disciples of the fourfold groups rejoice and practice it. 

This is our sutra. 

First of all, I think the Mogallana's mother suffered from her life being in the state of hungry spirit. This is one point. When Mogallana observed closely the world with his buddha's eye. The original term of a hungry devil or spirit in English. Devil means in ancient India, it is the spirit of the departed. So in ancient India, I think the ancestral spirit is called *preta*, P-R-E-T-A, which means the departed who expect offerings or food constantly. This is called *preta* in Sanskrit, which means ancestral spirit. But usually in English we translate it “devil.”

So *gaki*: *ga* of the *gaki* is just an additional word which doesn't have any [particular] meaning. But in English we say “hungry devil” or “hungry spirit.” So I think *devil*, in this case *preta*, is not something scary. Because it is the spirit of the departed who expects constantly the offerings and food. This is the original idea of *devil* in English, *preta*, which means the soul or spirit of the departed in ancient India's thought. Is that clear? 

And then this term comes into Buddhism, and then Buddhism, that term, *preta*, naturally kind of, of course, spirit of the ancestors, and also the spirit of departed who had a lack of personality, lack of something, what would you say, virtuous quality. Okay? Is that clear? So, who always expects something, always. But it is not something you develop. Because this is a lack of the virtuous quality which you have carried from the beginningless past. So you don't know, but you have it. So very naturally it is a big suffering for us. 

And generally speaking, it is not a particular person; [it is] everyone. Do you think so? Everyone. 

I think everyone [has] kind of the expectation or desire to get or know something. So you always try to know, try to know. That is a greed, it is really big greed coming from the heart of your mind, completely just like a spring of water coming up from your life. 

The other day Yvonne Rand said, in order to communicate you shouldn’t ask the kids what they did at the school, etc. Do you understand? You always ask kids what you did at the school in order to know who they are. So you constantly ask. And then by asking something, then you believe that you know them, or you will be able to have close relation with people. But sometimes not. Because kids feel pressure, unconsciously. So first of all, important point is, let them be present with parents and all circumstances first. That is most important for us. 

But we don't do it, always. You always try to know. If you stop knowing, very naturally you are critical, you begin criticizing, being critical to you, to others. That always happens. This is also one of greed. 

So this is kind of expecting food and offerings always. That is greed, one of the three poisons, greed. 

So, hungry ghost. The mother suffers from her life being in the state of hungry spirit. This is called hungry spirit, hungry ghost, we say. So all of us, in a sense, hungry ghost. 

And also, the second point is, the Buddha said, Mogallana felt sad very deeply, because he found [his] mother in the state of hungry spirit. So he tried to save her from suffering. But Buddha said, “The root of transgression that your dear mother committed are so grave that it is beyond your power to save her from her sufferings. Even though you have a feeling of piety enough to trample heaven and earth, heavenly gods, guardians of ground, devils, the people who follow the other teachings, and the gods in the four directions are of no use.” [That] means no one can help. So by your effort, there is nothing to help her. Because her transgression, this hungry spirit is really rooted deeply. 

Look at yourself. If you do that, then you can notice, you can see yourself. It's not you cannot save by yourself, no. You cannot be free from your hungry spirit by merit of somebody's power, or physical power, physical spiritual power. No. You cannot do it. Because nothing helps. Even the gods in the four directions. So gods in the four directions, the people who follow the other paths and teachings, devils and guardians of the ground, heavenly gods, etc., etc. All are talking about wonderful things which exist in the dualistic world, which we are always using. For instance, techniques, technologies, spiritual mediums, and physics, scientific technologies, and all the stuff. Because those are not something we cannot ignore, but we are always supported by, protected by those stuff. Psychology, philosophy, technologies, and physics, and astrologies, many things. But all are nothing but all things which exist in the dualistic world, changing constantly. So you cannot find anything stable. 

So that's why nothing helps. Because this is your hungry ghost. How do we do it? 

So that is what the sutra talk about. Okay? 

And then the Buddha says to Mogallana, “First of all,” well, when is best time, to save from this suffering? That is on the occasion of Pavarana on the 15th of July. The 15th of July is the last period of training, summer training traditionally in the monastery. Okay? In Japan too. And also on the last day of the training, summer training period, they had the Pavarana ritual. Pavarana ritual means that day is what is called Pavarana day. Pavarana means, literally, “satisfaction of wishes.” How can you get satisfaction of wishes? Due to, it is possible for us to get satisfaction of wishes by merit of reflecting upon their life. On the last day of the training session. That is called Pavarana day. 

And then, if you reflect upon yourself seriously, the more you can find out something negative. Not much positive. That is reflection. But negative aspect of human life by the reflection upon yourself is simultaneously identical with satisfaction of wishes. Ok? 

In other words, if I am quiet, instead of expressing my ego. In other words, if I express my ego, I want to stop talking, and then want to sleep in my bed. But anyway, I should take care of this egoistic understanding of my life, ok? And then, what do you mean? Negating this ego is to let me be present here. “To let me be present here” means to express satisfaction of my wishes, because I can talk, I can continually talk. Ok? Is that clear? So, negation is identical with affirmation. 

But we don't like negations, negative aspect of life. So, always you express positively yourself. So, we don't practice negative way of life. Do you understand? Is that clear? No? 

Well, if you don't, from now on, watch your life. Okay? *[Some chuckles from the audience.]* 

This is on the July 15th, alright? Today, July 15th. This is called Pavarana Day, and also Pavarana Day which means the day of satisfaction of wishes. That's why this day is what is called Buddha's rejoicing day. Because, well, later, I can explain, ok? 

Then on this auspicious day of Pavarana Day, July 15th, the last day of the training session, you should pay homage to the great venerable monks in the ten directions with offerings of rice, various delicious food, the five kinds of fruits, waters prevailing in the universe, incense and candle lights, spreading carpets on the floor, putting all different kinds of dainties in the world on a tray. So, then, on this auspicious day, please pay homage to the great venerable monks who have accomplished the summer training sessions following the Buddha's teaching, and on the last day of the training they have finished reflecting upon their life very deeply, and express satisfaction of their wishes by deep reflection upon their life during the training sessions. 

So that's why we should pay homage to those monks with offerings. In order to pay homage to them, you should express yourself in a concrete way. How? Offering incense, or bowing to them, or offering food. Something like that. So, in ancient Eastern Asia, Buddhists traditionally, we always offer something to those people in order to pay homage to. Physically and materialistically, mentally. 

So, next, third point: Why do we have to pay homage only to the monks, these venerable monks? So, here it says, "On this day, among all sacred assemblies, some of the monks who have attained the four stages of Zen practice in the forest and mountains," in other words, among all monks of assemblies in the ten directions, there are some who have been practicing in the forest and the mountains, and attained some stage of Buddhist practice. Some are some are shravaka and pratyeka. Some are shravaka means listening to Buddhist teachings and reading or listening to Buddhist teachings and attain enlightenment. *Pratyeka* means attain enlightenment by seeing, observing deeply the world, the nature, the rhythm of nature, the rhythm of the world. 

So, “Some are the shravaka and pratyeka who have attained the six superpowers, by which they can free edify people.” So, some are people who really attain enlightenment, in other words, they have fully joy, by listening or reading Buddha’s teachings in words. 

It seems to me that people in the United States are more or less *shravaka*. We really fully believe that we attain enlightenment by virtue of listening or reading Buddhist teachings in words. That's it. We can practice zazen, but this is a better way. But on the other hand, [in such] zazen we are shravaka. 

Well shravaka is fine, but still there is something you should take into account in the future. I don't want to say today. 

So that's why lots of grumbles, complaints there. Okay? Because you understand attainment, enlightenment, through the words, through the listening, the teaching in the words doesn't fit into the actual rhythm of your life. Because the rhythm of your actual life is something more than your understanding through the words. No. Do you understand? Even though you understand, even though you believe, "I attain the enlightenment," I don't think you are an enlightened being. 

I experienced very often in the past, after writing the thesis on the mere consciousness, particularly manas, ego consciousness, source of ego consciousness, I attained enlightenment, believing fully, "I am a great Buddhist." But it was completely opposite. No way. Since I came to the United States, all reality would be completely reversed. I didn't have anything to know, to tell you. Nothing. I was very confused! How can I do it? How can I teach? 

So, the rhythm of your reality is going constantly, something more than your attainment, experience of your enlightenment through the words, through the listening, the teaching in words. No way. 

So, that's fine. *[He laughs.]* We are *shravaka*. Okay? Or, if you don't like the Buddhist teaching or Christianity, religions, you can live in the heart of the mountains, always being present with nature, and solitude, and then you attain enlightenment. Sure, you can do it. But still, your life doesn't adapt to the great rhythm of human life. Your enlightenment is just a speck of dust. 

So, still you have to have lots and lots of practice for century after century to deepen this experience which you have had constantly. This is buddha’s practice, bodhisattva practice. Okay? 

I don't mean the experience of your enlightenment is bad. No. That's fine. But still, there is something important practice for you to continually deepen your experience again and again. Don't stop it. If you stop, you really become crazy about your career. If you become crazy about your career, the development of your life stops. Completely stops.

#### Part 2

</p>

... the ten stages of Bodhisattva practice. Some are with all the assemblies as monks. Anyway, there are many monks there. 

If you practice at Hokyoji, or if you practice in the city center for two months, say, at center, everyone attains a different experience, different stages of Buddhist practice. Some are completely shravakas, some are completely ignorant persons who don't care about any practice, any attainment, any development. Some are just normal guys. Some touch a little bit about the Buddhist teachings. Some touch deep of themselves. The many, many kinds of level of experience. 

But remember, wherever, whoever you are, you have been doing the same practice, one practice, so-called Buddhist practice, embraced by great enormous strength of nature or grandeur of nature or the universe. You are practicing. So more or less, even though you are ignorant or even though you are completely numb to the practice itself, still you are embraced, constantly supported by the grandeur of the universe. Believe me. Otherwise, you cannot survive. 

You exist here. How do you exist now? Before you think it, your life and also all other beings are supported by something more than your effort, your thinking, your thought. How the trees exist. As it is. As it is-ness means what? The self before you poke your head into. This is your life as-it-is-ness. Your life as-it-is-ness is exactly same as the tree's life as-it-is-ness. That life is really supported by the grandeur of nature and the universe, all sentient beings. We should appreciate it. 

Doing zazen: by the merit of doing zazen, you really go deeply into that stage of existence. You don't know what it is, but you feel it, you touch something. 

So that's why Buddha says, "They all together have received the same contented food, the pure precept and being endowed with the path of the sacred monk's life and vastness of their virtue." What you can practice, Buddha's way, what you can practice of sitting, zazen, here is what? Vastness of virtuous quality, which you are given originally, not by your effort. If you can sit zazen by your effort, everyone can have a chance to sit zazen. But how many people who don't practice zazen? Who don't listen to Buddhist teaching? But they try to want to know. But they don't do it. But you do it!

So I think remember, whatever kind of experience, whoever you are, anyway you are supported by the grandeur of the universe and nature. That's why in the Vimalakirti Sutra, Buddha always mentions, “Speak of something with one tone of voice.” One tone of the voice. One voice, single tone of the voice. That means, you are Buddha. You are great beings. 

So that's why, if you practice during the summer period for training session, I think you have been practicing Buddha's way. Whatever kind of experience you have had, anyway you have been doing the same and one practice of Buddha's teaching. So naturally you are mature. That makes your personality mature. That makes your life develop. That is called spiritual life. 

But if you always depend on technique and scientific technology and many stuff, you never have great maturity. So always there is something restless. The more you get the new technology and to develop yourself, the more you feel restless in the bottom of your life. The more you get the stuff and spiritual life, the more you don't feel comfortable. You don't feel [satisfied]. 

So how can you feel [satisfied]? 

I think you should settle in the self and be present in the vastness of your whole personality with the rhythm of nature. Then you can really feel stable. Even though you don't feel this, actually. That's why even though you don't feel pleased, practice for certain period of time, this is a training session we do. Then that makes your life mature and develop. That's [what] Buddha [says] here. That's why we should offer respect to those monks. 

And also if you practice like this, people will respect you, very naturally. 

So now, next, what kind of merit we can get? So here it says, “If you pay homage to these Prabharma monks with offerings, the present parents, the parents for seven generations, the six-brother relatives and the whole family are able to free themselves from the sufferings in the river of the three-crossing. That is in the Buddhism you have to come across over the three kinds of river. One is shallow, the second one is deeper, third one is the deepest. The meaning is the river of the three-crossing means when you go to the other world, there are three gates of the rivers. [...] At the all gates of the three, I think there are devils stand up and to catch you, to get you. And what you [do] is, take off your clothes and the devil hangs your clothes on the branch. And then by the degree of the transgression which you have had in the past, your clothes make the branch bend. *[He laughs.]* How much your clothes makes the branch bend, it depends on the karma of your life. Well, that's interesting. *[He laughs.]* 

For instance, you can know, for instance, the three kinds of guys, you stand up, all are monks and all are Americans, but one you feel a little bit pensive from one guy, you know? And then from the second guy you feel sad. Not sad, melancholy. From third guys you feel completely sad. Different. 

Or from the same one teaching, sometimes you feel joy, you know? Sometimes you don't feel joy. Sometimes you’re mad at the teaching. *[He laughs.]* You know? That depends on your karmic life. 

So that's your clothes which you have put on in the past. That's called the river of three crossings. 

So anyway, if you do it, very naturally I think you can save your present parents and the parents of the seven generations. That means the merit of this practice, the merit of observing the Pavarana practice extends to the present parents and also the parents for seven generations. Seven means endless: for many, many generations. But we just use seven. Seven, or three. 

So in Buddhism we call Parinama. Parinama means turning the merit of your practice to all sentient beings. In other words, giving the merit of your practice to all beings. In other words, you shouldn't have any chance to hold on to it by yourself. And then, the letting go of the merit of the practice to all sentient beings makes your practice, makes your life mature and develop. This is one of the beautiful Buddhist thought. We call [it] *eko* in Japanese. We call *eko* as the last dedication of the sutra. Anyway, that eko in Sanskrit is *parinama*. 

So anyway, that's why if you practice, if you do zazen, that merit of the practice extends to you, to people around you, and also to the trees, birds, and also parents, the people for the seven generations. In other words, to extend *all* universe in ten directions. 

So if you read *Jijiyu Samadhi*, *Jijiyu Zanmai*, on the sutra card, Dogen [talks] about this. This is the real significance of doing zazen exactly. Sitting truly with wholeheartedness, you can taste it, this one. 

#### 2 - 14:44

Well, next, the fourth point is how do we practice this one.

And then the Buddha said, “first of all, pray for the family of the donors, particularly for the parents for seven generations. If somebody offers food in order to respect you, or offers something material or spiritual or something, I think you should pray for the donors, and also donors' parents, and the donors' parents for seven generations. In other words you should pray for the donors and the donors' relatives, and the donors’ relatives and parents of seven generations, and all beings around the donors.

That prayer is really broad and magnanimous. Not only the particular person, donors. If you pray for the particular person and particular donors, very naturally this is give and take sense there. I pray for it, then you should pay homage to me – something like that. So naturally, Buddhist practice is we should pray for particular donors, but we should extend this practice to all sentient beings. That's why he says, this is our prayer. 

So pray for the family of donors, and particularly for the parents for seven generations, with the spirit of *dhyana*, with the concentration. So by the services of Buddhist ceremony, then we think, what kind of merit we can get? We always think of that. But this is secondary. What we have to do is pray for all the families of donors and all sentient beings with wholeheartedness. This is a key point of the prayer and practice, and walking meditation, and gassho, and washing your clothes, and [weeding your] garden, whatever you do. This is the most important, crucial point of our practice. 

That is called with the spirit of dhyana, concentration of meditation, and receiving food afterward. Then, you should have food. So you should offer yourself, in a way you should offer your body physically and mentally to donors and all sentient beings. Then you deserve to receive the food. 

When you have the food, next verse: "Be present peacefully in the stupa in the presence of Buddha first." That's interesting. If you get food, first of all, be present in the stupa. In the stupa means a holy place. Stupa means temple yard, temple territory, holy territory. In other words, buddha-land.

You should be present peacefully in the buddha land and in the presence of Buddha. Because buddha is always be present with you as a witness. In other words, buddha as a witness means grandeur of nature, grandeur of the whole universe. This is buddha as a witness. 

So you should be present peacefully in the stupa, holy territory, holy property, in the protection of the grandeur of the whole universe. 

In other words, don't be struggled. Don't flounder. Don't be greedy. Well, ... don't express gratitude first. No. Be present peacefully first. Sit down right here in the presence of Buddha. Not in the presence of your territory; in the presence of the Buddha, by which you are protected consciously or unconsciously forever. This what Buddha says here. 

Then when you have food, first be present peacefully in the stupa, in the presence of the Buddha and eat food after all assembly, prayer in the presence of the Buddha. Then after all assemblies pray in the presence of the Buddha. Pray for donors and all sentient beings in the presence of the Buddha. We should always do something in the presence of the Buddha, *always*. Otherwise you never feel stable and peaceful. Otherwise you cannot do anything peacefully, harmoniously.
