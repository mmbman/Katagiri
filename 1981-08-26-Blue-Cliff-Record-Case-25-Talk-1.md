... [The] twenty-fifth case of the Blue Cliff Record:

> The hermit of Lotus Flower Peak held up his staff and showed it to the assembly saying, “When the ancients got here, why didn’t they consent to stay here?”
> 
> There was no answer from the assembly, so he himself answered for them, “Because they did not gain strength on the road.”
>
> Again he said, “In the end, how is it?” And again he himself answered in their place, “With my staff across my shoulder, I pay no heed to people — I go straight into the myriad peaks.”
>
> (Excerpt From: Thomas Cleary & J.C. Cleary. “The Blue Cliff Record.” Apple Books.) 

The hermit of Lotus Flower Peak: according to commentary, this Zen Master lived on the top of the mountain, Lotus Flower Peak. He got his own hut on top of the Lotus Flower Peak. And also he constantly showed his teaching, holding up his staff, and saying, “When the ancients” – ancients means the Buddhas and patriarchs – “When the ancients got here, why didn’t they consent to stay here?” The staff implies, in this case – well, what is real life, what is the real thing of life. Well, we say “truth”. What is the ultimate, real thing of human life? There is a staff, anyway. Staff means this kind of stick, or a long stick, which is used for the monks or for Zen priests when they walk. Long one or short one, whatever it is, anyway that is a staff. 

And in his whole life, he answered any kind of questions, doing like this. Just like a *[unintelligible]* master: a good master always shows one finger, whenever people asked him, without saying anything. Just showed one finger. Or, another Zen Master, ****, always sat in zazen facing the wall, whenever whoever visted him to discuss on some aspect of Zen Buddhism, he didn’t say anything, immediately he sat in zazen facing the wall. That way was carried in his whole life, without change. That’s fascinating. It’s pretty hard to do that, because human beings are pretty noisy, you know? If you always show one thing, whatever you ask, you say you put a certain label on him, “He’s crazy.” Don’ you think so?

... good zazen. If you are constantly doing zazen without anything, without any reward, you don’t believe this. So very naturally, teacher is very hard to stand up before people who really ... greedy. Greedy ... so teacher gives some candy ... in order to satisfy them. That’s is very common. That is a very common type of existing religion, so called religion. 

Well from now on, anyway, I don’t think that is real religion. I don’t want to use religion either. I don’t know how to ... But important point is, forget it, and let it turn the word, religion. If I use ‘religion’, you really sort of consciously or unconsciously, you resist, don’t you think so? You resist, immediately. So forget it, anyway, forget that term. From now on, anyway, for the future, the important point is, real religion is to know, to realize, what is real life, what is real life. What is it? Whether or not, regardless of whatever kind of religion you believe or not, anyway you have to understand this, you have to research forever. That is what is the point, from now on. 

So, this is, you don’t understand very much, there are a person who use just one thing in his whole life to answer to any kind of question -- that is fascinating, it’s a wonderful thing. For instance, if you just picuture your daily routine, without stumbling over, just waking up and wash you face, going to zazen, just work, and come back. If you can do this, your whole life, believe it or not [he laughs], or regardless of whether you believe in any kind of divinity itself, if you can do this in your whole life, it’s wonderful. It’s great. But you cannot do this, don’t you think so?

I told you before, in the Lotus Sutra, you know the sun moon light tathagata was born in this world as a buddha named the Sun Light ... and the next generation, he was born, there was a Buddha named the Sun Moon Light Tatagatha. And in the next generation, there was a buddha named the Sun Moon Light ??. For century after century, buddha was born ... same person. Same name. 

This is very important for us. You know what is real life? Real life never changed, anyway, from generation to generation. Anyway, life was born in this world, millions ... life. Light tathagata. And next, in next generation, life was born, and it was named ... ??? tathagata. Same thing, generation after generation. Exactly same. Wonderful things. 

One of the famous thinker and writer in French named Rousseau, according to him, he says, “One is born with nothing. One dies with nothing.” It means with nakedness. We are born with nakedness, with die with nakedness. This is very nice, very nice. This is the same things: whatever generation comes, well, exactly the same. But I don’t know how much Rousseau searched this real picture of human existance through and through. I don’t know. It’s still questionable.

But he says, this is wonderful things. But more or less, not only, even though you don’t study Buddhism, more or less, some of human beings feel in that way. But they don’t want to research, because ther is nothing to excite. So that’s why they don’t want. But more or less, they feel. 

We were born with nakedness, we die with nakedness, this is not something pensive or sad, this is real pciture of human existence. We have to be, not have to be, we are already. Without exception, everybody. Or, trees, birds, whatever it is. 

Before you born in this world, after generation to generation, everybody dies in that way. Maybe in your previous life, you did same things, anyway. 

But this is very close, no gap between you and this real picture of life. Exactly the same. You were born with nakedness, you die with nakedness. This is very close thing. It is too close to understand. 

And also in the Lotus Sutra, Manjusri said to Maitreya Buddha, “You had practiced meeting myriad buddhas in your past life, and then your life is exactly result of your previous life, practicing in that way. Then when you were born in this world, you completely forget what you did.” I told you before, but this is a wonderful ... It is wonderful but it is not always wonderful. For instance, primitive, things means, briefly speaking, this means it is too close to understand or too close to think. But this is completely beyond you should think of it or you shouldn’t think of it. Because it is always with you. For instance, you stomach is completely perfect. It’s not neccessary to think. Or it’s not necessary to say “you should” or “you shouldn’t”. If the stomach is perfectly becoming one with you, it is completely beyond you should think or you shouldn’t think. That is what is called real reality. Completely beyond your thinking – or not thinking. That is according to Buddhism, maybe we say “absolute” reality. 

So, forget means, when you were born in this world, you completely forget what you did means, you have already real picture of human existene which is very close to you. That is, birth is coming with nakedness, death comes with nakedness. 

For instance, primitive people. Maybe a thousand years ago, primitive people lived in nature. Seeing meeting the rythm of nature: the sun coming up in the east, setting in the west. But it is not something strange, or it is not something they should think or they shouldn’t think. Primitive people completely accept, and then live with it. Without thinking, this is completely beyuodn they shoudl think or they shouldn’t think, beause it is very close to real life. 

So for many, many years, for century and centruy, people are not neceesary to think, or not necessary not to think, just facing the world face to face with the rythm of nature, rythm of life. Because it is one, it is exactly, that rythm of nature is exactly the rythm of priitive peoples’ lives, so no gap. So century after centruy, we did it in that way. And then after that, after many centuries, then many human beings ‘grow’ very much, physically and psychologically, and then start to think. “What is that? What do you mean, ‘The sun rises in the east.’? Or ‘the sun sets in the west’? What do you mean?” 

And they started to think, “What is the purpose? What is the moon? What is the sun? How does the earth operate in realtionship with the sun?” And then very naturally, they created lots of myths. That is myths, created by human beings. And then wit hthe development of human knowledge, human thinking, then they reserach, what is the earth? ... physics. 

And so, after many centuries, we didn’t notice this, just be one with the rythm of nature, because that rythm of nature was exactly one with the rythm of your life, so it’s not neceesary to think, just right on. But when civilization grows, they started to think, “what is this?” Then we created culture, so called myths. And also sciences. Religions. Created lots of things. 

That’s why Lotus Sutra says to Maitreya Buddha, “When you were born in this world, you forgot completely what you did” means, century after century, what we did was just to be one with the rythm of nature. That’s all. Beyond you should think or you shouldn’t think. Anyway, just like this.

If you read the Bible, the bible also says if Adam and Eve, didn’t think anything, just lived. With nakedness. And also finally, they started to think, “What is this?” And then they finally ... you know that pretty well, huh? 

This si really true. It’s not a ‘myth,’ it’s really human life. And then we completely forget real picture of human life. Real picture of human life is exactly the ame as the rythm of nature. Beyond you think or you shouldn’t think. It’s just life. This is the real reality, or absolute reality, your life is present in. 

And then when you forget, and then you start to live in your own way. But for many, many years, so far, we don’t know yet the real pciture of human existence. And then finally we start to thik, “What is this?” And then we think of our life. And then, according to religion, physics, and psychology, and I-Ching, and many things... think of human life. 

But when you think this, the real picture of life, and create many things – myths, physics, psychology, religions ... countlessly, endlessly you can create many kinds of myths, you can create. So far, we have created. From now on, we could craete more myths. The more human civilization is developed, pretty much, anyway. Constantly.

You know, one of the Zen Teachers in Japan lived on his way, practicing zazan and studying buddhism, and finally he got the degree, Ph.D., and he got the position of ... professor the university, and finally he became dean, and finally he became president of the university, and also finally he came to the united states and became an archbishop in the soto zen. And then finally he went back to Japan, invited by many people in Japan, and put him in the abbot of Eiheiji monastery. So his life is going very well. But... finally, his life, his body was completely ... numb. Dead? Paralyzed. Half of his body was completely paralyzed. So he couldn’t get up, so was always in the bed. And he said, “This is my karma.” This my karma. Well, he can say so, because he was a buddhist teacher, zen taecher, and also he was already abbot of eiheiji monastery, so he couldn’t scream anyway. But let’s imagine – this is a very good example. I always think that way. Whatever kind of position you have, whtever kind of knowledge you have, if you go to school so you can get lots of knowledge, and then you head is big, and then the people respect you. You know lots, freat. How did you learn? Many, many years you go to school, and then I got knowledge. But his life, your life is what? This real life there are lots of mess. [chuckle]

Well what I want to tell you is, if you want to get knowledge from school, fine, you should get it. But important point is, what this real life is. Real lfie is to live with people, trees, birds, as much as possible, you try to live in peace and harmony instead of interrupting others. That is importnt point. If you can educate somebody like this, that’s great religious education. Instead of giving knowledge of philosophy, psychology. So if you want to educate children, so you say immediately, “how can I teach the zen buddhism to children?” Wow, it’s pretty hard. You can teach, but even in the family life, why don’t you teach with your body, with your words, with your behavior, with your doings. And people catch your life. Let’s live. This family life is exactly small scale of society. What’s the difference between? Why don’t you live with the people without interrupting, huring others. Why don’t you think [about] others’ life, and live in peace and harmony. If the children have this kind of sense of feelings in his life, that’s wonderful, great. But we believe education is to send the children to school, getting lots of [knowledge]. Of course it is important. I don’t mean that we shouldn’t. We should do. But it is not all we hve to do. 

So I always think this case, real case. I know him very much, that’s why I criticize sometimes, and then a friend of mine said, you are wrong. Why don’t you respect his position, his reality, because he became already abbot of Eiheiji monastery? So, great. Invited by many people – it’s great. Whatever reason he has, anyway. But anyway, I always think this. He got very good positions: professor, and dean of university, president of university, and also archbishop of american zen buddhism, and also finally, abbot of eiheiji monastery. This is highest position for Zen priest, Soto Zen anyway. If you become abbot of Eiheiji monastery, you’re really proud of yourself, always. “Oh, good boy.” But right before this, well, his body was paralyzed. Let’s imagine. If you were him, what woudl you do? You’d scream, don’t you think so? If I were him, I would like to scream. “What is life?” I always depend on, anyway, lots of myths. And positions and philosophy, psychology we created, after we have knowledge to think enough. and then, we think, we create lots of things. And then finally, we depend on this position, because we want to be happy. But already we forget what we did in the past, just like the lotus sutra says. So all we have to do is, try to create wonderful myths, and philosophy, psychology -- building the big mansions, and people come together, looking at this, and then completely forget what they did in the past. That means, we completely forget what is real life, real picture of life. 

I ... some exampkles, during the second world war, a person was in the position of army in Japan, the highest positions. And then the situation was completly perverted. And then he lost official army position, and also present, the atmosphere of Japan was completely messed [up]. If you are the official army officers, the people didn’t liek you. So it was very dificult for him to find a job, and to support human life, his life. Because during the second world war, the army officers lived pretty well. Food, clothes, because [they were] army officers. But most people were very poor. No food, no clothes. So after this, completely situation was changed, and then the people didn’t like [him]. And then finally he tried to find a job, and finally he found a job, but that job is sales support, you know. So called I’Ching.... Standing or sitting in front of the station, there were all stations, if you go to Japan you can see lots of fortune tellers. Fortune tellers, you know, every station in front of the railroad station. And ... in the evenings, in Tokyo, more than ten fortune tellers sat in front of the stations. And asking people coming to see you hands, and etc. 

So he learned this because he was in the highest position when he was in the army, so he was pretty smart and sharp, so he studied this, and he got ... He ... and he lived wonderful, for many years. And finally, he was also paralyzed. And then, one of the zen teachers visited to see him, because he knew him. So he visited to see him in his house, and he said, that person said, “I didn’t know which there is such a big drop”. Do you understand, big drop? ...

Let’s see when you were born, completely you forgot what you did. That means, you forgot already what is real picture of human life, you forgot it. Because it is not necessary to think, or it is not neccessary not think, because that is real picture of your life. Your life is completely becoming one with rythm of nature, so it’s not necessary. So that’s why Lotus Sutra says, ... Anyway, century after century, you didn’t htink. And then when you were born, and then after your birth, still you don’t think. Becayse it’s already there. And ... started to think. But already human beings created lots of myths, and et cetera. Start to think, what is the real picture of human existence, and then we explain real picture of existence. That is a myth, that is philosophy, psychology. Big mansions. But if you depend on this kind of ... you build up huge mansions. But remember, you still forgot what you did, [which] means real picture of life, what is real picture of your life.

And then you completely depend on this explanation of human existence. And then you believe, “I get a happy life.” But this happy life is what? There is still big trouble. He has to be paralyzed. 

Well, it’s not neccessary to be paralyzed. Let see modern civilization, modern human life: cancer, exactly the same. More or less we are scared, we are threatened by cancer, because there is no guarantee, “I am immune to become cancerous.” No guarantees. So more or less, everyone is threatened by cancer. And then when you [get] caner, what do you do? It’s a trap, because we don’t believe this.

*[Tape change.]*

Well at that time, you want to scream. Because to be paralyzed, your life is, paralyzed is not something you can think. You understand paralyzed in your body. But it’s not such a matter of understanding, discussion. Not ... understanding, it is real thing you have to experience directly. When you become paralyzed, right in the bed every day. What do you do? Can you accept your life, saying “this is my karma”? Words are beautiful. But behind the karma, still we are screaming. Burning. Mind, emotions – lots of burning.
