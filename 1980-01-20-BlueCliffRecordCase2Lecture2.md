##### 1:20

Chao Chou was one of the greatest Zen teachers in China, in the 8th century. They said that he became a monk at 60 years old. And until his death, he practiced again and again. [Dogen](glossary#dogen) really admired this Chao Chou [Zen Master](glossary#zen-master). In [Shobogenzo](dogen#shobogenzo), he mentioned about Chao Chou very much. And also he, Chao Chou, was the great Zen Master who belonged to [Rinzai](glossary#rinzai-zen ) line but he never used the shout and the stick, the hitting the monks. He used very common words; he lived in usual way. But each statement was very sharp; to pierce all monks’ heart(?). That’s why everyone admired him very much. 

##### 3:24

Chao Chou is the name of the place… which was location of his temple named (Guānyīnyuàn?). So one day, “Chao Chou, teaching the assembly, said, “The Ultimate Path is without difficulty; just avoid picking and choosing. As soon as there are words spoken, ‘this is picking and choosing,’ ‘this is clarity.’” It comes from the third patriarch’s statement, which occurs in the “Belief in Heart and Mind”: he says, “The Ultimate Path is without difficulty; just avoid picking or choosing. Just don’t laugh or hit, and you will be rooted and clear.” So Chao Chou quoted just the first verses, “the Ultimate Path is without difficulty; just avoid picking and choosing.”

##### 5:00

The Ultimate Path means, yesterday I told you, the task is the same as the path of the fundamental vehicle of transcendence. Usually truth is regarded as something which is far from us, which no one can touch. But I don’t think [Buddhism](glossary#buddhism)… understand(s) in that way. The truth is always with us.

So, the characteristic of truth is completely… something transcendent, which means beyond human speculation - good or bad, right or wrong. It makes all beings live in peace and harmony... that is characteristic of truth or universe: unifying all things. Beyond human judgement, we go back to ??? … So from this point, how we can approach truth, how we can reach this truth. That’s why we have to manifest ourselves in the state of transcendence. Transcendence means the state of a person who is never tossed away by judgement, good or bad, right or wrong. 

That’s why in [zazen](glossary#zazen) we shouldn’t judge ourselves, good or bad, right or wrong. Anyway right now, right here, all you have to do is to let your life force bloom. At that time, good or bad right or wrong appears and disappears very naturally. Even … if you meddle with those… judgement, evaluation… simultaneously, the many kinds of afflictive preferences appears. That is a problem for us, which leaves human beings in confusion and bewilderment.

##### 7:58

So in order to be one with the truth, we have to manifest ourselves in the state of person who is never tossed away by thoughts and ideas. That means, yesterday I told you, under all circumstances, we have to release and forget ourselves; throw ourselves away to [zazen](glossary#zazen), when you have to do zazen. When we have to do gassho, we have to do that. At that time, you can really manifest yourself. Bloom the flower of life force, from moment to moment. Wherever you may be, it is just like lotus flower.

##### 9:02

That is the path of the fundamental vehicle of transcendence, which is called the Ultimate Path. That is really great vehicle which you are right on. Truth is not something which we can think, we can envision, we can believe, but it is something that you have to be right on. That is the Ultimate Path. At that time, it is without difficulty. It’s really… just to be right on the vehicle, which is absolutely transcendent of human evaluation.
 
##### 10:12

I told you some day (earlier), there are three ways to know, to understand… something. One is to know something with perception. Through the perception, you can create the world where you can pretty easily express the emotional stuff. Hatred, pleasures; many emotional things come up. This is very common, very usual life style we do. Because there are lots of affirmation(?), there are lots of fun, there are lots of excitement in the realm of expressing directly our emotional self. Whatever we are comes from this realm. But it is also, simultaneously, human trouble. This is first way to understand, to know, our lives in human world.

##### 12:12

The second way is to know through consciousness, vijñāna. Consciousness is a principle intellect, understanding deeply using our intellect. So consciousness is very important for us; without consciousness, we cannot understand, we cannot exist as a human being. Consciousness is reaching to… clarity… to the truth, but it is still not good enough, so…

##### 13:24

Third, [Buddhism](glossary#buddhism) emphasizes we should understand something with prajna, wisdom. So, wisdom is… Through the wisdom, we should understand something which, it has already been created by our consciousness. So that understanding is really limited by individual experience, individual understanding. So I told you very often: first phase, mountains are mountains; this is a very usual understanding. But that is also very limited, narrow understanding, because that mountain is something understood through our perceptions. So simultaneously, there are a lot of obstructive preferences. When the winter comes, and the mountains are covered with snow, immediately we hate the snow, because snow interrupts the mountains life, which should be beautiful. So, we hate the snow, we hate the cold. But actually, no matter how long we hate snow and winter and cold weather, well, when the time comes to be winter, winter comes. So, also where those obstructive preferences come, that is grief(?), it comes from perceptions. 

##### 15:52

So, second stage: mountains are not mountains. The mountains you have understood are not real mountains. So we should polish our understanding a little more. Searching, studying the structure of human world, human being, philosophical, psychologically, religiously, in category, and then we should know what is … essence of nature, essence of being.

##### 16:50

Then third, finally, we can reach mountains are mountains. That mountains are really beautiful mountains which are never tossed away by human evaluation or judgement. Then, all this says, we will ??? … something seen after the third stage.

So with wisdom, we can understand the mountains which are intact, which are ??? by nobody. So it is beautiful mountains. At that time, that is ultimate path. Flowers, mountains, rivers, stars, water, creeks, pebbles, infant, animals; all are going on this path. That path is ultimate. No one can touch; no one can contaminate by afflictive preferences. When the time comes, winter comes. When the time comes, summer comes. Whatever you think, whatever you feel. That is the state of being, which is called suchness. ???

##### 18:52

In the world, this is the ultimate path. And everyone, human beings, all beings, should go through this path. At that time, that path becomes Great Vehicle. And all we have to do is just be right on. At that time, it is without difficulty. I tell it to you to… anyway, the ultimate path. 

##### 19:25

Just avoid picking and choosing. Problem is, we create simultaneously afflictive preferences, when you judge, when you evaluate. Perception, evaluation should follow… afflictivite preferences simultaneously. That is a problem for us. That’s why we should avoid picking and choosing. But actually, there is no way to escape picking and choosing. We are always picking and choosing. But, if you try to escape or avoid picking and choosing, you create more picking and choosing. So, what do you mean, avoid picking and choosing? Well we have to understand, previously(?) the structure of our understanding, to study the gradual methodical study, and also in categories(?) Then, you can find what is way of avoiding picking and choosing. After that, there are words spoken, this is picking and choosing; but the moment when you use words, that is already picking and choosing. In other words, when you see microphone, microphone is already microphone, are picked and chosen by you, by your consciousness. So already microphone is something arbitration of consciousness. 

##### 21:27

And “this is picking and choosing, and this is clarity”. So picking and choosing the microphone, of the pick and chosen by your consciousness, is being seen at the first stage, mountains are mountains. That is very perverted view; it’s not deep. “Perverted view” means not something wrong; it is okay, because we are there. But it is perverted; it’s not deep. It’s a very narrow understanding. That’s why we have to go through all the (time there?) That is second, if you realize what first stage, mountains are mountains, through perception, at that time, simultaneously you can enter into second stage, that is mountains are not mountains. But if you don’t awaken to first stage, you misuse your consciousness. At that time, this is what is called delusion.

##### 22:52

So, we have to understand, we have to awaken to our understanding: how we understand. That is, (that) the microphone picked and chosen by your consciousness is nothing but delusion. When you realize this, that is simultaneously you can enter the gate of second stage, which is called mountains are not mountains; this is called [enlightenment](glossary#enlightenment). So that is next said, “this is clarity.” So you can see very clear vision of microphone, including... in the universe.

##### 23:56

“This old monk does not abide within clarity; do you still preserve anything or not?” Whatever you say, the Ultimate Path is completely beyond delusion or [enlightenment](glossary#enlightenment). So, why you can say, “this is delusion,” or “this is enlightenment?” That is still all that you are already in the world of picking and choosing. If you say “you are enlightened” or “you are deluded,” that is discrimination; already that is in the realm of picking and choosing, that’s delusion. Even though you say “I am enlightened person,” this already picking and choosing. Your enlightenment is completely no-word. So when you see delusion through and through, until the words drop off, at that time, you can enter into the gate of enlightenment. That is enlightenment. But if you are trapped there, it is not enlightenment. So until the word of ‘enlightenment’ completely drops off, no word, that time, that is [clap or finger snap] real enlightenment. 

##### 25:50

When you want to help with your own intention, why are you clinging on your intention, trying to help. At that time, you cannot help somebody. So, lots of confusion there. Afflictive [karma](glossary#karma)... afflictions come up. So completely no intention; when you have completely no intention to help or not help, at that time you can really help, because your words, any word, any behavior, are really in accord with helping others. That is helping. Perfection of help; giving. That’s why the old monk Chao Chou says, “I don’t abide within clarity,” “I don’t abide within [enlightenment](glossary#enlightenment),” because he knows what is real enlightenment. Real enlightenment is enlightenment which is words completely dropped off, dropped away. At that time, enlightenment really exists. When you understand truth, there is no word. You cannot expect, but we get… it is with you constantly, through work on your life, constantly penetrating. That’s why everyone can realize who you are. 

##### 27:54

So, Chao Chou says, “I don’t abide within clarity; do you still preserve anything or not?” Actually there is nothing to preserve there. What you call [enlightenment](glossary#enlightenment), what you call delusion, which is called… something between; nothing to preserve. Just here. But Chao Chou says, “do you still preserve anything or not?” That is really checking with the monk, to see how he understands the Ultimate Path.

##### 28:35

“At that time a certain monk asked, ‘Since you do not abide within clarity, what do you preserve?’” Because this monk is really sharp; he understands already what clarity is, what the Ultimate Path. So other (older?) monk says, “I don’t abide,” so monk really pierce his heart, “Since you do not abide within clarity, what do you preserve?” There is nothing to preserve; why do you think so? Chao Chou replied “I don’t know either,” but this “I don’t know either” is really sharp, great answer - just like [Bodhidharma](glossary#bodhidharma). Bodhidharma said “I don’t know” when he was asked by Emperor Wu, “Who are you in front of me,” because he said essence of [Buddhism](glossary#buddhism) is vastness and nothing holy; completely beyond holiness or non-holiness. This is essence of Buddhism. If it is true, who you are, Bodhidharma? Who you are, in front of me? You are this! If there is no holiness, no sense of holiness, no sense of ordinairy person, who (are you)? Bodhidharma says, “I don’t know.” But this “I don’t know” is not the same as we say “I don’t know.” Completely different. 

##### 30:36

Chao Chou replies, “I don’t know either.” We should understand. Walk deeply through our path(?) The monk said, “Since you don’t know…” still monk... “took on” Chao Chou [Zen Master](glossary#zen-master), “since you don’t know, teacher, why do you never let say that you don’t know about clarity … and truth?” Anyway this monk completely drive Chao Chou Zen Master at the corner of the no word. Perfect; because he said, “I don’t know.” He said “I am not present in the clarity.” “Why do you know, why do you know you are not in clarity?” “It is because you don’t know.” [laughs] But this is very sharp monk; monk is very sharp. Completely Chao Chou was driven into the corner by this sharp monk. In Ch’an most of the people are very confused, very confused. But Chao Chou was very great Zen Master, so he said - he was not confused - he said, “It is enough to ask about the matter; [bow](glossary#bowing) and go away.” [laughs] This is a great answer, too. But usually in Zen monastery, the monk’s first bow - the monks who want to ask the teacher, first they have to bow, then ask, make a question. After he gets the teacher’s answer to the monk, and the monk understands, at that time the monk bows again and leaves. This is custom; before and after, he bows. This is manner of when we have to ask teachers in the monastery. So, he bowed before he asked, and then he asked such and such, and finally when the time comes to leave, he has to bow. So Chao Chou said, the time has come to go away. So ... bow, withdraw. But this is not… Chao Chou uses the real situation. For instance when you have... when the time comes to have breakfast, well maybe Chao Chou says, go away to have breakfast. Maybe when the time comes to drink a cup of tea, maybe Chao Chou says, go and drink a cup of tea, and leave. Maybe so. When (it’s) time to wash your face in the morning, go to bathroom to wash your face. Or any time, his answer works; pretty effective. So that is Chao Chou’s answer: it is not to ask about the matter, for no matter how long you think with your head, it just goes endlessly; ridiculous. What for? You don’t know. Why do know that? It’s ridiculous. So because the intellectual sense cannot help us, between the truth and delusion, truth and [dualistic](glossary#dualistic) world, always there is a gap. How can you stop up this gap? By intellect? No way, no way. If you try to stop up this gap with intellect, the more you create, the more this gap is getting bigger. So sooner or later, you have to stop it. That’s why Chao Chou said, “It’s enough to ask about the matter; please bow and go away.”

##### 36:00

Let’s read the Engo [Zen Master](glossary#zen-master)’s notes. The first one, Engo Zen Master says, “What’s the old fellow doing? Don’t create complications!” This is the first note for Chao Chou teaching the assembly. The note says, “What’s the old fellow doing? Don’t create complications!” Of course; if the truth is just like mountains are mountains, flowers are flowers, pebble is pebble, why do we have to explain? Truth is like ??? The willow is green, the flower is red; if it is truth, why do we have to explain? That’s why Chao Chou (actually Engo, Yuan Wu) said, “What’s the old fellow doing? Don’t create complications.” In other words, do not ???? For century after century, [Buddhas](glossary#buddha) and [patriarchs](glossary#ancestor) give people human being trouble; for 2500 years. That is important for us. Otherwise, we don’t know. We don’t know field is green, flower is red. Trouble is not complication; it is very good for us. Because complication doesn’t come from something else; complication comes from fact. We are already complicated. We as humans (are) always complicated. Who creates complications? We create. Mountains are just mountains, but we don’t understand in that way; why? So, we have to understand what is intuition, what is judgement, what is inference, what is a word; then philosophically, psychologically, we analyze… it’s really complicated. What is the reflection; why do we suffer? Why do we laugh? The whole thing comes up very well, because human beings always complicated, and humans always make that ???? That’s why feeling of pleasure, suffering, pain and also … understanding. So Engo [Zen Master](glossary#zen-master) says, “what is the old fellow doing? Don’t create complications.”

##### 39:51

The note for “the Ultimate Path is without difficulty” is: “not hard, not easy.” The real truth is completely beyond … hard and easy. Why he says, actual truth is, ultimate practice is not difficult. Ultimate truth is completely beyond hard and easy. But this is the notes; Engo’s notes are always criticizing him, criticizing and raising, and completely throw away - always. Whatever the notes, Engo [Zen Master](glossary#zen-master) looks at the koans from a different angle. Because everyone looks at the same subject from a different angle. Someone praises his angle(?); someone criticizes ... Chao Chou and the monk… that’s why the Engo Zen Master understands quotes from different angles. That’s why sometimes he praises, admires Chao Chou; sometimes admires the monk, who makes a question; whatever it is, ridiculous or wise question. Anyway, sometimes admire, sometimes look down upon him.

##### 41:53

But whatever he does, it has deep meaning. So here, same applies to the note for “the Ultimate Path is without difficulty.” Why does he say not difficult? Because truth is completely beyond hard or easy. But not for… just avoid picking and choosing. He says, “What’s in front of your eyes? The Third Patriarch is still alive.” This is a statement that Engo [Zen Master](glossary#zen-master) spoke, after… anyway, Chao Chou Zen Master. But this statement comes from “Belief in Mind,” mentioned by Third Patriarch. So, what’s in front of your eyes? If you say, don’t pick up anything, don’t choose anything. In other words, same applies to when [Bodhidharma](glossary#bodhidharma) says, “What is the merit?” After practicing many, many years, what’s the merit? He says, “No merit”. So, if you practice, there is no reward, no result. What does [Buddhism](glossary#buddhism) teach us? If you practice, you can make progress in your practice; but if you say no... what is the essence of Buddhist teaching? Bodhidharma says “nothing,” and the vastness of “nothing holy”.  Vastness and nothing holy, what it means is nothing complete; it relates to... Bodhidhamra, you are here. As what is called Zen monk coming from India. You are here. What do you want to teach? From where do you come from? Do you come from... Only you are here. So Bodhidharma says, “I don’t know.”

##### 44:48

So... Engo says, “What’s in front of your eyes?” Microphone is microphone, table is table; … exactly here. Whatever you say, don’t pick up anything, don’t choose anything. Still here is the table, here is the microphone as it is; why do you have to say? So what is the table, what is the microphone.

##### 45:26

Engo [Zen Master](glossary#zen-master) told... Chao Chou Zen Master … you are just like the Third Patriarch, who was alive now. He looks like the Third Patriarch. That means Engo Zen Master teased him.

The footnote for “As soon as there are words spoken, ‘this is picking and choosing,’ ‘this is clarity’” says, “Two heads, three faces. A little boasting. When a fish swims through, the water is muddied; when a bird flies by, feathers fall.” ... Chao Chou says, if you use words, ... [tape change] ... Don’t use the words. Avoid picking and choosing; already you are ... That’s why two heads, three faces. It means you lose already. For instance, in [zazen](glossary#zazen), we say “don’t think good or bad.” Don’t think; or “think not thinking”. Whatever you say... “don’t think in zazen” - what do you mean? “Don’t think” means, “should I think?” or “shouldn’t I think?” in zazen. So you say ... “I am not thinking”. When you don’t think, can you say “I am not thinking?” No, you cannot say; if you think so, you are already thinking. So all that is the “two heads; three faces”. That means you are always [dualistic](glossary#dualistic). Very tricky.

##### 48:22

So “I am,” or for instance, “I don’t care”... “What is your purpose of your life?”; you say “I don’t care.” But “I don’t care” is not exactly “I don’t care”. You really care, that’s why you say “I don’t care.” “I don’t care” is already ... so your ... outlook on life. Your principle. Your discipline (?) of your life. You cannot completely “I don’t care”. If completely you don’t care, you cannot say you don’t care, because you are dead. If you are completely in the world of confusion, well, you can just accept confusion. But if you say always “I am confused”, “I am confused,” that is not exactly accepting confusion; you are already looking at the confusion in the [dualistic](glossary#dualistic) world. That’s where you are really screaming, shouting anyway. But if you are completely one with confusion, nothing to say. If you are present in the realm of not-thinking completely, you cannot say “I am not thinking.” So, that’s why Chao Chou says “as soon as words are spoken, ‘this is picking and choosing’, ‘this is clarity’”. If you say so, why do you say, avoid picking and choosing? So, two heads and three faces, a little boasting. When a fish ... Boasting means, it’s really so: if you have complete concentration on breath or [zazen](glossary#zazen), you really think, “I have real concentration, right concentration.” This is little boasting. Because it is already the perfect, the good concentration, seen in the [dualistic](glossary#dualistic) world. If you are exactly one with perfect concentration, no words, no words. You cannot... No two heads, no three faces; exactly one. The words just drop off. 

##### 51:15

“A little boasting”: “When a fish swims through, the water is muddied; when a bird flies by, feathers fall.” Anyway, when the fish swims through, the water is muddy. Well, white crane... is ... up in the snow, it looks like white, all snow; so you don’t realize where the crane is. But then you say white cranes on snow. That explanation is already something to add to white snow. Exactly no discrimination there, nothing to fix, because crane is white, snow is white. But if you say “the truth is just like white crane on snow,” it is still explanation. Complete concentration is no word of concentration. It is also still explanation. For real concentration, which is called no word of concentration, is, from moment to moment concentration is alive, without leaving any trace. 

##### 53:00

Truth is something which is realized from moment to moment; it’s not intellectual sense, it’s not intellectual understanding, it is not emotional self, it’s not, well, spiritual path (or task?). Nothing to say; I can’t explain it. But you can’t; you have to say something. That’s why, in many ways, to explain it.

##### 53:37

Fifth note, for “This old monk does not abide within clarity” says,
“His thieving intent already shows; where is the old fellow going?” [slight chuckle] His thieving intent already shows because, first, you use word, you are picking and choosing. Don’t use a word. Then, other monk, he says, “I don’t abide within clarity.” That means, already I told you, when you don’t think, you say “I don’t think now,” but there is already thinking. That’s why his thieving intent already shows. You are thief. Anyway, you already pick; it’s already you reveal yourself as a thief. “Where is the old fellow going?” Where are you heading for? You say, “I don’t know.” [laughs] “Ask my thief, it is already.” You show yourself as a thief; you are not true to yourself. If you don’t know where you are heading for, you cannot say so. Just go. Just go with skillful attention, okay? If you say, “I don’t know where I am heading for,” it is not true. It is not true way to go(?)

##### 55:41

I told you before, someone asked ... was asked by somebody on the street car, “Where are you heading for?” He said, “I don’t know. I don’t know where I am heading for. Ask my feet.” Really confusion...

##### 56:08

The sixth note says, “He’s defeated. Still there is something, or a half.” He says in the main case, it is a note for, “Do you still preserve anything or not?” It’s really Chao Chou trying to pick up somebody, trying to find somebody who has... difficulty about this question. That’s why the Engo says, “He’s defeated. Still there is something, or half.” Is there anyone who is against, who has some doubt. 

##### 57:05

So, finally, he finds that there is a monk who wants to make a question. The seventh note, for “At that time a certain monk asked, ‘Since you do not abide within clarity, what do you preserve?’” He says, “The monk presses him well; his tongue is pressed against the roof of his mouth.” That means, Engo really instigates the monk to ask more. “You are good boy, go ahead.” [chuckles] Anyway, should drive the monk or the thief to the corner, where there’s no word, no (explanation). Go ahead. That means, Engo says, the monk pressed him well. “Good boy. You did it.” His tongue is pressed against the roof of his mouth; that means, you did it. 

##### 58:26

Eight note, for “Chao Chou replied, ‘I don’t know either’” says, “The monk crushed this old fellow dead; he has to fall back three thousand miles.” Anyway, Chao Chou said “I don’t know either.” “I don’t know either” means “you did it, exactly did it; you crushed the old self dead.” You completely... crushed the ... thief. Chao Chou [Zen Master](glossary#zen-master) completely hangs out the white flag. [laughter] And then he withdraws three thousand miles, and hold up. That means, “I don’t know.” But it’s not exactly hanging out the white flag. It is not the same as we do. Great answer. 

##### 59:40

The ninth note for “The monk said, ‘Since you don’t know, Teacher, why do you nevertheless say that you do not abide within clarity?’” says, “Look! Where is he going? He’s chased him up a tree.” “Look, where is he going?” That means, Engo [Zen Master](glossary#zen-master) says, “Look! Chao Chou, watch out, he is great Zen Master! You should watch carefully where he is going, where is he escaping from. Your answer, your question - watch out, he is great Zen Master. So, finally he says, Engo Zen Master, “He’s chased him up a tree,” because the monk drives Chao Chou Zen Master ... to the corner, where there is no escape, no choice. That’s why now is on the verge of life and death. Great! Look, watch carefully. Where is he escaping, where is he heading for?

##### 1:01:17

Tenth note, for “Chao Chou said, ‘It is enough to ask about the matter; [bow](glossary#bowing) and withdraw’” and then says, “Lucky thing he has this move; the old thief!” Lucky thing he has this move, the old thief. That’s great action. Did it. Chao Chou did it. Very (???). He did it.

##### 1:02:00

The monk ... when you discuss human life and human world, philosophical, psychologically... well, it drives you into the corner, where there is no choice to escape. That means, you are completely on the top of 100-feet high pole... you cannot reach. And simultaneously that is reality in which your life is present. It is reality, too. So, in whatever way you try to understand human life, intellectually or practically, you reach the same situation. Being on the top of a 100-feet high pole where you cannot move an inch. But, you have to; you cannot stay there. You have to do something; because in this reality... many things moving and changing. That reality is something which is moving and changing constantly. You cannot stay always without doing anything. So you have to move ... from the top of the 100-foot high pole. This is daily living. 

##### 1:04:12

Actually, intellectually, if you move from the top of the 100-foot high, you appear to die. But, you cannot stay there. If you stay, you are falling. If you go, you will burn out, whatever you think. It doesn’t make sense. Finally, what shall I do? Your reality is exactly on the verge of life and death. And then finally, what you’ll do: release, and forget yourself, and throw away yourself, into [Buddha](glossary#buddha)’s home. That means completely full concentration, with wholeheartedness. We have to deal with ... as it really is, before you pick and choose with your afflictive preferences. This is our practice. 

##### 1:05:20

Continually we have to do this, but still intellectual sense works every day, because we have accumulated for many, many years. That’s why we have to handle this ... that is philosophy, psychology. So we have to study, one by one. But ... urgently, what we have to do, is to understand where we are. There is completely no choice. To escape what you get into; not to escape, not to get into; this is life, this is death. Life and death... It’s very simple; when the time comes to die, just die. But this is very simple. This is the real death, and this is the real life. But, we cannot do this. That’s why we have to practice. 

##### 1:06:30

So, our reality is, exactly no choice, no escape. No getting into. Just like being present from the verge of life and death, on the top of a 100-feet high pole. From day to day, you cannot stay there, you cannot move away; what are you heading for? What should you do? No way; at that time, words completely drop off. Nothing to say. So, when the time comes to sleep, go and sleep. When the time comes to have breakfast, have breakfast. But this breakfast; to have breakfast is not something seen from the first stage. ... Having breakfast, seen from the third stage, deep understanding. And then at that time, you can handle the breakfast really with careful, compassionate generosity and attention. That is release and forget yourself, and throw away yourself into [Buddha](glossary#buddha)’s home. At that time, mountain(?) comes from, not from you, from Buddha’s world, truth. There’s no need (for) effort. Something helps you, anyway. At that time, many things ... work... even though you don’t realize. That is the best way to do it.

The koan in this koan also teaches ... and also Engo [Zen Master](glossary#zen-master) really commented this...  particularly in the last two notes, “look, where is he going? He’s chasing him up a tree”; “Lucky thing he has this move, the old thief.” Very important for us.

What you do is very simple: practice with ... shikan-taza. But this simply is ... not simply... we usually understand that simplicity is to do something on the verge of life and death; there is no choice, to escape, to get into. This is what’s called “shikan”. It’s not just a simple way. Just a simple way without using your consciousness; without awareness. With true awareness; understanding past, present and future. ... You are not completely tossed away by past present and future, and just continue to be present right now. From this presence ... broad vastness ... vast world comes up. Extending to the past, present and future. This is what is called spiritual stability(?)

Whatever your situation, in whatever situation you may be - you are poor, you are rich, you are clever, you are not clever - in whatever situation you may be, you really stand up straight. 

Do you have some questions? 

##### 1:10:55

**Question**: [unintelligible]

**Katagiri**: But that is ... love and hate ... for a lot of people that is different... many emotional stuff. But we have all the love and hate and.. many emotional stuff. We don’t ignore this. We can’t throw them away. Why? From where that term comes, “avoid love and hate”: because we love already... we have already means, we have to take care. That means we shouldn’t obsess(?) with them, and, well, not confused. We must be finally free from them. In other words, what is the true love? You cannot say. While you can explain what love is... that is not real love. Don’t you think so?

**Question**: What I was wondering was do we have a choice... to hate or not to hate.

**Katagiri**: Of course. We should choose. But you cannot always hanging on.. sooner or later, you must be free. Even though love is good, but you cannot all the time hanging on.

**Question**: (?)

**Katagiri**: First choose, but we must be free from, finally. That means we should understand what real love is, real hate is. Do you understand? 

**Question**: Meh. 

**Katagiri**: Well anyway, you have to reach the third stage. [laughs] But you should choose. That’s why you have to choose, you have to pick - by what? By you. But ... we have to be careful... choosing and picking every day. But it is your understanding, your life. So, first, it is not perfect, that’s why... if you realize this, simultaneously you get into the second stage, “mountains are not mountains.” And then you can research, one by one: why? That is our practice. And finally, we can come back again to “mountains are mountains”; this is the third stage. At that time, we can really understand what real love is, what real hate is. What is real meaning of afflictive preferences that human beings possess? But, no words. Completely, words drop off. That means, you can handle afflictive preferences day-to-day. Anywhere, in which you are ... free from this. This is our practice.

Commentary is... Engo’s commentary is pretty nice. So, if you have time to read the commentary to this case. I don’t have enough time to study with you the verses, the poem and commentary to the poem.

Okay.
