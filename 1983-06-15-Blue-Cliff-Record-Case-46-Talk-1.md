***Archive Issue:*** The online audio for this talk is actually from *Blue Cliff Record* Case 43 Talk 2, on the Five Ranks, so this talk is currently not available. However, the next talk sounds like the first talk.

*Blue Cliff Record* Case 46 is also covered extensively in [“*Fukanzazengi*: Dōgen's Universal Recommendation for Zazen – Talk 4”](1979-06-12-Fukanzazengi-Talk-4).
