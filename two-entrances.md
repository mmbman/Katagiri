理入者、謂藉教悟宗。深信含生同一真性。但為客塵妄想所覆。不能顯了。若也捨妄歸真。凝住壁觀。無自無他凡聖等一。

G: To enter into the principle is to understand the essence of the doctrine through teachings. Deeply believe that all living beings have the same true nature, but it is covered by external dust and delusion and cannot be revealed. If one abandons delusion and returns to the truth, concentrating on the wall and observing that there is no self or other, then the ordinary person or the sage is one.

A: By "Entrance by Reason" we mean the realization of the spirit of Buddhism by the aid of the scriptural teaching. We then come to have a deep faith in the True Nature which is the same in all sentient beings. The reason why it does not manifest itself is due to the overwrapping of external objects and false thoughts. When a man, abandoning the false and embracing the true, in singleness of thought practises the Pi-kuan he finds that there is neither self nor other, that the masses and the worthies are of one essence, ...

B:	 Entering by principle means that one awakens to the thesis by means of the teachings, and one deeply believes that all living beings, common and sagely, are identical to the True Nature; that it is merely because of the unreal covering of adventitious dust that the True Nature is not revealed. If one rejects the false and reverts to the real and in a coagulated state abides in wall-examining, then self and other, common man and sage, are identical; ...

C: Entrance via principle means to rely on the teaching to awake to the doctrine. Believe deeply that life, both ordinary people and saints, share an identical true nature, but due to adventitious contamination it
is covered in falsity and cannot shine forth. If one rejects the false and returns to the true, stabilizing oneself in wall-contemplation, self and other, ordinary person and saint, will be equal, one. 

D: To enter by reason means to realize the essence through instruction and to believe that all living things share the same true nature, which isn’t apparent because it’s shrouded by sensation and delusion. Those who turn from delusion back to reality, who meditate on walls, the absence of self and other, the oneness of mortal and sage...

堅住不移、更不隨交教、此卽與理冥符。無有分別寂然 無為 名之理入。

G: Stay firm and do not move, and do not follow other teachings. This is in harmony with the principles. There is no distinction, there is stillness and inaction, this is called entering into the principle.

A: ... and he firmly holds on to this belief and never moves away therefrom. He will not then be a slave to words, for he is in silent communion with the Reason itself, free from conceptual discrimination; he is serene and not-acting. This is called "Entrance by Reason".  

B: ... firmly abiding without shifting, in no way following after the written teachings—this is mysteriously tallying with principle. It is nondiscriminative, quiescent, and inactive; we call it entrance by principle.  

C: If one stands firm and does not shift, and moreover is not influenced by literary teachings, this is to be merged with principle, to lack discrimination, to be quiet and inactive, which is called entering via principle.

D: ... and who remain unmoved even by scriptures are in complete and unspoken agreement with reason. Without moving, without effort, they enter, we say, by reason.

行入謂四行。其餘諸行悉入此中。何等四那。

G: The four actions are called the practice. All other actions fall into this category. What are [those] four?

A: By "Entrance by Conduct" is meant the four acts in which all other acts are included...

B: Entering by practice means the four practices, for all other practices are included within these.

C: Entry via practice is the so-called Four Practices. All other practices are included in these practices.

D: To enter by practice refers to four all-inclusive practices:
