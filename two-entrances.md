是理入是行入理入者謂藉教悟宗深信含生同一真性但為客塵妄想所覆不能顯了若也捨妄歸真凝住壁觀無自無他凡聖等一。

G: This is the entry into principle and the entry into practice. The entry into principle means to realize the doctrine through the teachings. To have a deep belief that all living beings have the same true nature, but it is covered by external dust and delusion and cannot be revealed. If one abandons delusion and returns to the true nature, and concentrates on the wall and observes that there is no self or other, then the ordinary people and sages are all one.

A: The one is "Entrance by Reason" and the other "Entrance by Conduct". By "Entrance by Reason" we mean the realization of the spirit of Buddhism by the aid of the scriptural teaching. We then come to have a deep faith in the True Nature which is the same in all sentient beings. The reason why it does not manifest itself is due to the overwrapping of external objects and false thoughts. When a man, abandoning the false and embracing the true, in singleness of thought practises the Pi-kuan he finds that there is neither self nor other, that the masses and the worthies are of one essence, ...

B:	 The first is entrance by principle and the second entrance by practice. Entering by principle means that one awakens to the thesis by means of the teachings, and one deeply believes that all living beings, common and sagely, are identical to the True Nature; that it is merely because of the unreal covering of adventitious dust that the True Nature is not revealed. If one rejects the false and reverts to the real and in a coagulated state abides in wall-examining, then self and other, common man and sage, are identical; ...

C: Entrance via principle means to rely on the teaching to awake to the doctrine. Believe deeply that life, both ordinary people and saints, share an identical true nature, but due to adventitious contamination it
is covered in falsity and cannot shine forth. If one rejects the false and returns to the true, stabilizing oneself in wall-contemplation, self and other, ordinary person and saint, will be equal, one. 

D: ... reason and practice. To enter by reason means to realize the essence through instruction and to believe that all living things share the same true nature, which isn’t apparent because it’s shrouded by sensation and delusion. Those who turn from delusion back to reality, who meditate on walls, the absence of self and other, the oneness of mortal and sage...
