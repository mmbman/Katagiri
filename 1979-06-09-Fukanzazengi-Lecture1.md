[The] last sentence of the main subject of [Fukanzazengi – Universal Recommendation for Zazen](glossary#fukanzazengi) – says, "For you must know that just there, in [Zazen](glossary#zazen), the right [dharma](glossary#dharma) is manifesting itself, and that from the first, [dullness](glossary#dullness) and [distraction](glossary#distraction) are struck aside." [*he repeats the quote*] 

This is a sort of conclusion of [the] main subject in [Fukanzazengi](glossary#fukanzazengi) . It means that, if you do [zazen](glossary#zazen), in zazen, "right [dharma](glossary#dharma)  is manifesting itself" means original nature of the self is manifested, very naturally. And also that "from the first, [dullness](glossary#dullness)  and [distraction](glossary#distraction)  are struck aside": from the first, distraction and dullness are going away, by themselves, even though there is nothing to force them to go away. This is the real meaning of [shikantaza](glossary#shikantaza). It's pretty difficult to understand, but this is really true, which you experience in your daily living. Life is really based on this teaching. 

When you yourself manifest, if you manifest yourself as you really are, at that time, very naturally from the first, [dullness](glossary#dullness)  and confusion and [distraction](glossary#distraction)  are struck aside. Because you are manifesting yourself as you really are from moment to moment; in other words, you can stand up straight, right now, right here, but that means you can manifest yourself. So if you can stand up straight, right now, right here, that means you can't be stumbling over distractions; from the first, [they] are struck aside.

##### 4:00

Or, particularly when you get angry, when you're confused, very naturally you really want to express anger and confusion through your daily living. But I don't know exactly where it is the best way to keep away from anger or to understand anger, what it really is. So, if you really want anger to go away, very naturally, all you have to do is, you must be a little bit scared of the world. In other words, if you do gassho, or sometimes, religiously speaking, you pray to God, you pray to the [Bodhisattvas](glossary#bodhisattva), you pray to [Avalokiteshvara](glossary#avalokiteshvara): "Please help me, please help." And then, at least [while] you [are] pray[ing] to the God, or you [are] pray[ing] to the [Buddha](glossary#buddha), or Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, [Manjushri](glossary#manjushri), or while you are sitting here, there is quietness, tranquility – well, very naturally, anger is struck aside, from the first. 

But, we don't do this. Completely opposite. If you get angry, *just sit*. But if you express anger, you know pretty well, [the] expression of anger influences others. So you can create your circumstances, which [are] called "angry world." So very naturally, people don't feel good; well, people get angry, [*unintelligible*].‌ Then very naturally, anger is sort of a snowballing, again and again.

But when you do [zazen](glossary#zazen), or when you pray to the gods, "Protect me" – even though you don't know how to deal with anger, "please help me" – [you put aside?]. Or why do you pray to the gods? God helps you? God takes away your anger? I don't think so. Or, you believe God really takes away your anger. Well, in a sense you believe, but actually, intellectually, you don't believe [it]; because anger is still anger, even though you pray to the gods, even though you pray to the [bodhisattvas](glossary#bodhisattva). [Avalokiteshvara](glossary#avalokiteshvara) is very nice; bodhisattvas expressing compassion, [Buddha](glossary#buddha) 's compassion. But even though you pray to the gods or bodhisattvas, still there is anger. So, you don't believe, but in a sense you believe. So finally you don't know why you are doing [it] in that way. So finally you say, "I just pray, because I don't know what to do." So you pray to the bodhisattvas: "Avalokiteshvara, please." Sit down in front of Avalokiteshvara, make your mind calm, and pray. That's pretty nice. At that time, there is no room to let the anger express, even for a moment. The anger, from the first, is struck aside. It's going away.

##### 8:39

That is our life, okay? So, we have [the] practice of [bowing](glossary#bowing) [to] [Buddha](glossary#buddha) . Bowing [to] Buddha is to express the deepest appreciation to your existence; how sublime life is, how important your life is. But you don't understand how sublime it is, how important your life is, how important [*unintelligible*]; you don't understand. Even though you understand, that is just a speck of dust of understanding of the human world. It's just a speck of dust. So actually, you don't understand. 

But anyway, how sublime life is is reality, real reality. Completely beyond human speculation; this is reality. This is your life. This is tree's life. This is the Sun's life. This is the Moon's life. This is the Universe's life. 

So, if it is true, even though you don't understand, why don't you express the deepest appreciation to your existence? How? With \[a] [bow](glossary#bowing). Just bow, to the [Buddha](glossary#buddha) . Touching your whole body to the floor, anyway: bow. That is the way to express appreciation to your existence. 

##### 10:30

Before you [bow](glossary#bowing), you must be you, who has accepted your life: how sublime it is, already. And then, that's why you can bow. There is no ego understanding, [ego consciousness](glossary#ego-consciousness). Selfish understanding: "I don't understand," or "I understand" – whatever you say, there is nothing. When you are completely [Buddha](glossary#buddha), when you really accept [the] sublimity of your life, of your existence – very naturally, you come back, you come back. But to bow is to accept, simultaneously to accept, [the] sublimity of life. So very naturally, ego consciousness from the first is struck aside.

That is \[what] [Dogen Zenji](glossary#dogen) says. So first, if you do [zazen](glossary#zazen) according to Dogen's mention, or [what the] [patriarchs](glossary#ancestor) mention, or [Buddha's](glossary#buddha) suggestions: if you do zazen like this, as a conclusion of your practice of zazen, very naturally, the [dharma](glossary#dharma), original nature of the self, is manifest. Manifesting itself, and also, [dullness](glossary#dullness)  and [distraction](glossary#distraction)  from the first [are] struck aside. It's going away. 

##### 12:45

But actually we don't do [zazen](glossary#zazen)  like this. Zazen is used as a means. At that time, you accept yourself as [an] immature person. And then, through zazen, you will want to reach a certain higher level, which is called mature level of human life. Seeing you in the future – at that time, the present life is not mature; immature, or unhappiness. That's why you want to practice zazen. So at that time, zazen is completely means to an end.

So that means you already accept your life which is not sublime. Your life is unhappy. Your life is not sublime. So, lack of sublimity there. If you do [zazen](glossary#zazen)  like this, as a means to an end, you accept the lack of sublimity in your existence. That's why you really want to do zazen. But no matter how long you do zazen like this, it's very difficult to realize your peaceful, harmonious life.

Because at that time [zazen](glossary#zazen)  is a means. "Means" means you are already creating something as a fixed idea. But the end itself is just actual movement-activity, which is called zazen. So just *do zazen*. "Do zazen" means you are present from moment to moment with the actual dynamic working which is called doing zazen. Becoming one with doing zazen; not seeing zazen as a thing, objectively or conceptually. If you see zazen as a means, it is conceptualized. That's why zazen is a little bit something far from you. So that is [dualistic](glossary#dualistic) world. The important point is, you must accept zazen as really total activity, which is vivid, alive from moment to moment. 

And that is, at that time – well, even though you don't understand what [zazen](glossary#zazen)  is, accept zazen. Which means, do zazen. Even though you don't understand how sublime your life is, anyway, [bow](glossary#bowing) to the [Buddha](glossary#buddha) . If you bow to the Buddha, selfish understanding from the first is struck aside. That is [shikantaza](glossary#shikantaza) – very naturally.

##### 17:16

Psychologically speaking, there are several component factors in living. One is circumstances. The second is sensory world, sensory system. And also movement system, movement world – movement system of your living. And also, the gut system; your guts. We have lots of guts. The world of the guts, and also, brain-nerve system.

So, circumstances, and also, sensory world, sensory system. Sensory system is to accept or to give some information; to get some information or to give some information to somebody, and to learn information from the outside. Through the sensory system, which is called eyes, nose, ears – so, sense of seeing, sense of hearing, sense of tangibility, et cetera. That is sensory world, sensory system. 

And also, movement system. Movement system is through the body and the mind; by getting lots of information inside, immediately you can do [something]. Your whole body and mind creates a certain energy, to compel you to act. That is [the] movement system; you have this. That is complete unity of the sensory system, and also nerve system and brain system; lots of things. Then immediately you can create a certain movement.

And also, the gut system. You have lots of guts. 

Next is brain-nerve system. 

##### 21:08

And one more [system]: that is total personality. Total personality is [the] exact center of your living, core of your living. Without total personality, you cannot get circumstances, and sensory world, or movement system, nothing. There is [Katagiri](glossary#katagiri); that core of Katagiri is really supported by total personality. Total personality is character created by Katagiri in the past, in the present, in the future. My parents, my grandparents, and my ancestors; that is total personality. *My* personality is something I can create, after my birth. So this is kind of [like] character. If you say "personality," psychologically speaking this is a little bit broad. So *my* personality is something I can create after my birth; but there is another personality I can create. I have carried my personality from before my birth; this is maybe my parents. And also maybe I have carried, from my parents, from my grandparents, from my grand-grandparents, and ancestors. So that is total personality, the whole personality. 

##### 23:23

So, if I see myself – here is Katagiri – immediately there is a certain kind of a [sense]; a "smell". Because that smell is... Well, a part of this smell consists of something I have created after my birth. So the other aspect of my "smell" is something I have carried before my birth; from my parents, grandparents, grand-grandparents, and ancestors – maybe [from] before the world [began]. So at that point, that personality is really [a] "smell". If you see somebody, there is a smell. Katagiri smells. 

But Katagiri "smell" is a kind of a result we have judged. So ... from where [does] that smell come? If you research again and again, finally, there is no evaluation, because you don't know from where it comes. You have to go back to the beginingless past; you have to go back. And you have to go to the endless future; then you can understand. So finally, that smell is no evaluation, something not evaluated. That is called [Buddha](glossary#buddha)  – or, original nature of existence. Psychologically speaking, that is called total personality. Total personality; maybe trans-personality, whatever you say. (Presumably referring to [transpersonal psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpersonal_psychology)) 

But trans-personality immediately smells: "I smell something," "I smell myself as Katagiri". So at that time it's pretty hard to adjust, to make myself in peace and harmony, in a sense. But in a sense, I feel good – but feeling good is not always feeling good, not always helping you. Sometimes, it becomes [a] stink.

##### 26:18

So, whatever I feel from my personality, there is always some confusion. Waves of the mind, always. Feeling good, feeling bad: whatever you say, that is a wave. Because that feeling comes from – anyway, stink. What is called total personality. 

Because I don't know, what is my [karma](glossary#karma)? Why did [I] become a monk? I don't know. I know why – but on the other hand, there are a lot of reasons. I don't know why, so I cannot say. 

That is really stink.... From where that stink of Katagiri comes? Nowhere. You have to really go back to beginingless past, to the endless future. 

##### 27:35

So finally, that stink of Katagiri, which is called total personality, becomes trans-personality. That is original nature of existence. That is the core of your daily living.

You are already under this core, under this huge tree. It's vast; *huge* tree. Because, it's tuned into the past and the future, your personality. You have to believe this. But believe or not, your life is really there, really there.

##### 28:39

So that is [what is] called [Buddha Nature](glossary#buddha-nature) . And also, what is Buddha Nature? If you want to know psychologically, that is called [alayavijñāna](glossary#alayavijñāna), in Buddhist psychology. Or sometimes, [primitive Buddhism](glossary#primitive-buddhism ) says that [it] is [karma](glossary#karma). Karma is completely beyond good or bad, right and wrong. But simultaneously, karma is something which is very powerful to carry your life in [the] samsaric world. But on the other hand, karma is – anyway, if you want to know karma, you have to go back into beginning-less past, and endless future. Finally, no [object?]. What is karma? No [object?]. But karma is [real?]. How do you know? [*unintelligible*] You [can? can't?] know. 

##### 30:00

When I became a monk and went to a monastery, at that time, monastic life was completely blooming for me, so ... it really awakened me, every day. My eyes opened wide, and looking at everything, [I] learned lots of things. But, some other monks [were] always creating [a] dull feeling, and indulgence, and they didn't like sometimes doing [zazen](glossary#zazen), and laziness... [*he chuckles*]. So for me, it was wonderful for me. And on the other hand, I felt once that people called me, "you are crazy." Of course, maybe so. Accordingly to indulgence, maybe to practice hard was crazy. It makes you crazy. But I didn't care, because I learned lots of things. So day after day was really bright; I just did it.

On the other hand, there is completely opposite aspect of life I learned from all these monks. I didn't want to ask them, "Why do you do it that way? What is the meaning; why are you monks? In the monastery you want to be lazy? You want to learn laziness? Well of course, it's okay, but what is the purpose, why? Why are you here?" I didn't understand. I didn't care. 

On the other hand, same applied to me. "Why are you practicing hard, in [zazen](glossary#zazen) ?" I don't know.

##### 32:35

From this point, in everyday life, we can create our own everyday life. On the other hand, there is other aspect of life we cannot create. Something compels you to do. So, your daily living is, in some aspect, understandable; but your daily living is in some sense not understandable. So, life is pretty [*unintelligible*]. 

That is called [karma](glossary#karma); that is called [Buddha Nature](glossary#buddha-nature) . We don't understand. Because the present, your life, comes from beginningless past, endless future. We should be there. And finally, we should accept this, and we must be present there, constantly on the big tree.... Psychologically speaking, this is total personality.

##### 34:20

And circumstances: In order to realize this core of the human life, first of all we have to make arrangement of circumstances, and sensory world, and also movement system, and gut system, and also brain-nerve system. Anyway, we have to make arrangement. That's why [Dogen Zenji](glossary#dogen) said in [Fukanzazengi](glossary#fukanzazengi), "Cast aside all involvements; cease all affairs." This is arrangement of circumstances. 

If you meddle with all environment or all affairs right in the middle of [zazen](glossary#zazen), you cannot experience calmness. You cannot stand up straight, you cannot sit quietly right in the middle of zazen, because there are too many things you are involved in. So first of all, we have to make arrangement [of] circumstances. Instead of expressing hatred [of] circumstances, or destroying circumstances; just to make arrangement. 

##### 36:23

And next, our sensory system. We have a sensory system, but it's not necessary to destroy [it], or to keep away the human world, because we have already. So instead of maligning, throwing away sensory system, or destroying sensory system, first of all, we should accept sensory system. And important point is, how to use [the] sensory system. 

That's why [Dogen Zenji](glossary#dogen) says, "A quiet room is suitable." Or, "Do not allow drafts of air to enter, or rain and frost to intrude." Or, "The place of sitting should be lighted, and kept from becoming dark at any time, day or night." "Eyes should be open, not too widely, nor too narrowly." This is how to make arrangement of sensory world. First of all, you should make a choice of circumstances. What kind of a room you have to use? Because you have six senses. You can see this room through your eyes. It gets really dark. If you paint this wall red, and green, and yellow – completely seems different, don't you think so? And also, if this room is too dark, it's not good; if this room is too bright, well, it distracts your mind, distracts the sense of seeing, vision. And also, if you choose the location of the room which is very noisy, a very noisy location, at that time it really distracts the sense of hearing. So the important point is, "A quiet room is suitable." And also, "Not too dark, not too bright, at any time, day or night." 

("Do not allow drafts of air to enter," etc. is from the [Zazengi](dogen#zazengi) chapter of [Shobogenzo](dogen#shobogenzo), which is distinct from [Fukan zazengi](dogen#fukanzazengi).)

So that is how to make arrangement of sensory world, instead of destroying, escaping from, or expressing hatred toward sensory world. You should do this.

##### 39:42

And next, movement system. Movement system comes from unity of your physical and mental focus. Your body and mind work, then simultaneously movement comes up. You cannot destroy your movement. Sometimes movement comes from instinct, sometimes comes from sensory world, sometimes comes from higher level of [thought?]. Sometimes, we don't know. [Karma](glossary#karma)? But anyway, there is always movement. 

So, we have to make arrangement of movement. For this, [Dogen Zenji](glossary#dogen) says, that is half lotus position or full lotus position. Or Dogen Zenji says, "Place both your hands in this manner, close to the body, with the joints of the thumb opposite the navel." Or, "Sitting upright in proper position, neither inclining to the left nor to right; leaning neither forward nor backward. Sitting in [zazen](glossary#zazen)  silently, and immobile." 

This is very simple movement. Two hands are unified; your eyes [are] not wide open, not closed, just [half?]. That is [unification] of the movement of your eye-nerve system. Very unified. 

If you open your eyes wide, it really distracts your mind. So, not wide, not closed. And two hands put together, and lips together, and teeth together; the tongue should be touching the roof of your mouth. And full lotus, and half lotus. And just sit down; not leaning forward, not leaning backward; just straight up. 

This is movement, simplified by our arrangement. 

##### 42:38

And next, [the] gut system. For this, [Dogen](glossary#dogen) says, "Eat and drink moderately." And also, "Breathe gently through your nose." But actually, your heart, your lungs, and hormone system, or your intestines, your stomach, are completely beyond your control. It's going on. Even though your heart is beating, [go and?] slow down, okay? And then you put the gasoline into it, and try to get the energy – you cannot do it. So when you see the heart slowing down, *[unintelligible]* slow down - but that is [*unintelligible*]. Either way, it is. Sometimes you have to accept it.

So, your heart, your lungs, and your stomach, your intestines, hormone system, are completely beyond your control. But there is one thing that you can control, and that is the breath. And also this breath really influences the whole system, all systems of the hormones, and also the lungs, and heart, everything. That is the breath. That's why we try to concentrate on the breath, taking care of breath. At that time, all guts work very naturally, very naturally. Circulation of your breath, pretty good. [The pulse?] is pretty good. And your heart is beating normally. Very natural. 

##### 44:56

Next, the brain-nerve system. According to brain-nerve system, [Dogen Zenji](glossary#dogen) says, "Do not think good or bad; do not administer pros and cons." Or, "Cease all the movements of the conscious mind, the gauging of thoughts and views. Have no design on becoming a [Buddha](glossary#buddha) ." 

(It looks like the translation Katagiri is using may be Norman Waddell's, as it says "administer pros and cons". See ["The Heart of Dogen's Shobogenzo" (PDF File)](https://terebess.hu/zen/dogen/The-Heart-of-Dogens-Shobogenzo.pdf))

That is [the] brain-nerve system. According to brain-nerve system, we have to regulate mind. Mind is characterized by attachment; attaching to one of two extreme ideas. This is characteristic of mind. So, we have to make arrangement of the function of the mind...

[tape change]

"... of all thoughts and views. Have no design on becoming a [Buddha](glossary#buddha) ." 

##### 46:20

Completely throw away any germination of wishes, thoughts, views. You just view yourself spin with [zazen](glossary#zazen) . That's all you have to do. 

[Dogen](glossary#dogen) [says], "Do not think good or bad, right and wrong," because we have to regulate mind, which is characterized by attachment to one of two extreme ideas. That is mind. That's why we shouldn't attach to good or bad, right and wrong, or neutral. That is [egolessness](glossary#egolessness). Selflessness. Practice of egolessness. 

If your mind really attaches to good or bad or neutral, immediately here is a thought, and view, wishes. And thoughts, views, wishes create [dualistic](glossary#dualistic) world. Some go this way, some go that way; always going back and forth. And sometimes, stop it. Even though you stop for a while, you cannot stop always. So you start to move, to the right, to the left. That is dualistic world. Finally, you don't know what to do. 

##### 48:16

And [in] your life you are really disappointed. That is what is called delusion, what is called [dullness](glossary#dullness). Dullness is sort of, completely sinking into the bottom of the ocean. That is dullness. 

On the other hand, [distraction](glossary#distraction). [Dogen Zenji](glossary#dogen) says, distraction is [that] your mind is scattering in all directions. Even though you sit down here, your mind is going to Japan, to India, to Europe, and all over. That is distraction. 

On the other hand, [dullness](glossary#dullness)  is completely [like] you are sinking into the bottom of the ocean. And finally, you don't know what to do. Whatever kind of delusion, [either] dullness or [distraction](glossary#distraction)  – both distract. Your activities distract [*unintelligible*]. Settling yourself in the self is very difficult.

##### 49:49

So finally, we have to practice regulating the mind. That regulating of the mind is [the] practice of [egolessness](glossary#egolessness). 

But how can you practice [egolessness](glossary#egolessness)? [Dogen](glossary#dogen) [Zen Master](glossary#zen-master) says, if you really simply forget your body and mind, you should throw away yourself into the heart of [Buddha](glossary#buddha). That means, you should throw yourself away to something. That "to something" is, to your object. But this object is not any object, this is the house of the Buddha. 

So ... first of all, if you want to deal with this book [for example], you have to throw away yourself into this book. But this object is not the book. This book is [Buddha](glossary#buddha) . So, to throw away yourself into this book means, throw away yourself into the house of Buddha. That means, deal with the book, as well as dealing with your life. So, you can deal with this book with compassion. It's really compassion; you can deal with it. At that time, the book really teaches you something.

##### 51:42

So that is [egolessness](glossary#egolessness). And also, at that time, if you throw away yourself, your body and mind, into the house of the [Buddha](glossary#buddha), at that time, [Dogen](glossary#dogen) [Zen Master](glossary#zen-master) says, "When function comes from the direction of the Buddha, and you go in accord with it, then there's no strength needed and no thought expended. Free from birth and death, you become Buddha. Then there can be no obstacle in any man's mind." At that time, it means, if you throw away yourself into the house of Buddha, that is nothing but expressing [the] original nature of existence. Very natural. Simultaneous. 

##### 52:56

So, there is [zazen](glossary#zazen). Zazen and you: if you see [them] separately, that is a situation [in] which you can create discrimination world, [dualistic](glossary#dualistic) world. Zazen and you: "I like zazen," "I don't like zazen," whatever you say, that is dualistic world. So first of all, you have to make arrangement, [of] zazen and you, circumstances and sensory world; you have to arrange all things. And then, at that time, if you arrange all circumstances, I told you before: and then, you should take care of zazen. With [egolessness](glossary#egolessness).

##### 54:00

At that time, the practice of [egolessness](glossary#egolessness) is to throw away yourself into [zazen](glossary#zazen), perfectly in the flow of zazen. Offer your body and mind to zazen, completely. At that time, there is [no-self](glossary#no-self). No self.

But if you completely offer yourself to [zazen](glossary#zazen), that zazen helps you, simultaneously. 

##### 54:42

That's [egolessness](glossary#egolessness). Egolessness, based on spirit of throwing away, offering yourself into [zazen](glossary#zazen), is based on the help of [samadhi](glossary#samadhi). Only you can throw [yourself] away into zazen; at that time, you cannot do it without samadhi. One-pointedness. If you want to practice samadhi, one-pointedness, you have to arrange circumstances. Cease all affairs, and all involvements. There is no chance to involve in some of the cars, and trees, birds, whatever. Throw away everything, and then you can really focus on just one object. This is samadhi. If you practice samadhi, if you are right in the middle of samadhi, very naturally there is practice of egolessness. Because, you can offer yourself to zazen. 

So, very simple task. And then, at that time, if you offer yourself, and then after that [if] there is no design on becoming a [Buddha](glossary#buddha), or expecting a reward, et cetera ... at that time, this practice is exactly to manifest [the] original nature of the Buddha, existence.

##### 56:36

So, there are three important [points]:  [samadhi](glossary#samadhi), and [egolessness](glossary#egolessness), and no design on becoming [Buddha](glossary#buddha), no design of expecting reward. [Those] three points are very important. 

[Egolessness](glossary#egolessness). That property, that is to regulate the mind. How to regulate the mind? Well, egolessness. How to practice? Egolessness. Throw yourself away; in other words, offer yourself into [zazen](glossary#zazen) . How can you do that? By the help of  [samadhi](glossary#samadhi), one-pointedness. With wholeheartedness, you can do it, very naturally. 

##### 57:37

If you really want to accomplish one thing which you want to do, you have to cut off all involvement in all affairs. In other words, make arrangement. The young kids are listening to the radio and also studying and also trying to accomplish one thing. It seems to be good, but it's not real achievement, accomplishment, of doing one thing that you want to do. So if you really want to accomplish one thing with your wholeheartedness, very naturally, it is very natural that you keep away, you make arrangement of circumstances. 

##### 58:35

This is [a] very natural attitude to our life. That's why [Dogen Zenji](glossary#dogen) says, "Cease all involvement. Throw away all affairs." Don't worry about certain sound of the cars; so what? How can you throw away? Simplify; you should simplify your activity, yourself and object. Let's see the relationship with subject and object. ... See the relationship simplified, between you and [zazen](glossary#zazen), [or] study, or playing guitar, whatever. At that time, very naturally, how can you simplify? Anyway, let's practice  [samadhi](glossary#samadhi). Samadhi is one-pointedness. If you come from one-pointedness, there is [egolessness](glossary#egolessness). Let egolessness simplify your life. Manifest simplicity; simplify your life. Because you can offer yourself into the object; zazen, and study, et cetera. 

##### 1:00:05

Simplify, unify; that is what is called harmonious. Or regulating; we use the term regulating. Regulating is not [to] destroy, not [to] move from one to another. Regulating means that you know all things, many things around us. First, accept. And, how to *arrange* this; how to use circumstances, sensory system, movement system; that, and also brain-nerve system, whatever it is. And then, let's sit down, in the core of your total personality. That is [Buddha Nature](glossary#buddha-nature).

##### 1:00:58

And then this total personality, which is called [Buddha](glossary#buddha), is completely perfect, all-pervading. [Dogen Zenji](glossary#dogen) says, "The origin of the way is perfect and all-pervading." And also manifesting original nature of existence. If you arrange the circumstances, and sensory world, movement system, gut system, and also brain system, nervous system – very naturally, you can practice  [samadhi](glossary#samadhi), you can offer yourself into, and you can practice [egolessness](glossary#egolessness). And also, you can do something without any design on expecting a reward. That is perfect: perfect, harmonious life. That is peaceful life.

And then, even though you don't understand, your total personality is perfectly peaceful, harmonious. How? ... This is belief. Belief really helps your activities, your practice. [*unintelligible*] It's really helpful. 

##### 1:02:39

So, four important – and I told you three important, but, four important points. 

First, belief. That is faith. Faith is total acceptance that [your] original, total personality is perfectly peaceful, harmonious. That is a huge tree, huge tree. When you are there, you are saved. Anyway, you are saved. And, you grow, very naturally. This is faith.

##### 1:03:18

And then, if you are under the huge tree, and saved, at that time that is called salvation. If salvation is experienced directly, that is [enlightenment](glossary#enlightenment). How can you experience enlightenment? Well first, practice of [egolessness](glossary#egolessness). How can you practice egolessness?  [Samadhi](glossary#samadhi); one-pointedness. And then, just do it. And then if you just do it, there is still no design on expecting any reward. Just do it. That is [shikantaza](shikantaza) .

That is really helpful. That is really [a] way of helping the people: offering your merit, merit of your practice, to all sentient beings. But according to [a] narrow understanding of human life, first you really cut off your weeds, the root of your weeds. And you want to be happy. That's nice; but it is [a] narrow understanding, because you cannot completely cut off the weeds. You cannot destroy weeds. Weeds grow any time, anywhere.

##### 1:05:05

So important point is arrangement. Arrangement of our circumstance. How use the weeds.

And release. If you release, [there] is nothing but being, which is helping all sentient beings.

##### 1:05:26

So, that is the conclusion of the main subject in [Fukanzazengi](glossary#fukanzazengi) . That's why [Dogen Zenji](glossary#dogen) said, if you do [zazen](glossary#zazen)  according to [what] Dogen mentions, very naturally, the [dharma](glossary#dharma)  is manifesting itself, and from the first, [dullness](glossary#dullness)  and [distraction](glossary#distraction)  are struck aside. Very naturally. That is [the] meaning of zazen. We do always.

By the [zazen](glossary#zazen), if you believe "I should be happy," or "I want to do something," this is not real practice. You never find peace and harmony. Because, if you believe that, zazen is always something far from you. And also, not only zazen; you accept yourself. So, you are not happy person; so you yourself [are] also a person far from real person, opposed to happiness or unhappiness. That's why it's pretty difficult to deal with you, and also it's very difficult to deal with zazen, and whatever you do. So, that is not [the] practice for us.
