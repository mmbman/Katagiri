title: "The Awakening of Faith"
---

*The Awakening of Faith* (大乘起信論), more fully *The Treatise on Awakening Mahayana Faith*, is a foundational text that helped establish the concepts and practice of Mahayana Buddhism, which includes Zen Buddhism. In particular, this text seems to be a sort of bridge between the concepts of Buddhist psychology attributed to the historical Buddha and those concepts further developed by Mahayana Buddhism. (Katagiri Roshi says something like this early in Talk 1, but his statement is somewhat open to interpretation.)

Katagiri Roshi gave 38 talks commenting on this text, in five series. The recordings of 22 of those talks are currently available. 12 are not yet in the online audio archive; 4 are missing or lost.

This series of transcripts is in draft stage.
