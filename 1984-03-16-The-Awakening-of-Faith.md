**Katagiri Roshi:** I don’t want to explain the history of this book, or the story of the author, Ashvaghosha. I think if you read this book, if you can understand, mainly I want to concentrate on the teaching of this book. This teaching is very interesting. Kind of the teaching of Buddha based on the teaching of emptiness and also the teaching of the function of human psychology.

Mainly in Buddhist history, two lines of teaching. One is the teaching of emptiness mentioned by Nagarjuna. After that in Buddhist history, the Buddhist teaching based on Buddhist psychology. Buddhist psychology has been developed, that is Abhidharmakosha, and the mere consciousness. But this book is kind of overall picture of the teaching, including the teaching of emptiness, and also Buddha’s teaching in Buddhist psychology. So very interesting book. So very systematical. The title is *The Awakening of Faith*. But originally, I think I would like to say “The Treatise on Awakening Mahayana Faith”. 

Mahayana means... maha is great, yana is vehicle. In this book Mahayana is described. The essense of what is now, here. Or ultimate nature of what is here and now. Two meanings; one is what is the ultimate nature of what is here and now, and the also the second meaning is embracing. So maha means essence or the ultimate nature of what is here now. That maha is to embrace all sentient beings. That is the meaning of maha. 

And the function of this maha is a kind of vehicle to carry all sentient beings; that’s why we say vehicle. So mahayana, yana means vehicle. So all sentient beings are carried on. So that is mahayana. 

And in this book... look at this paper. I would like to say a structure of this book. Excuse me... I have to say more [on] Mahayana faith. Awakening of Faith ... this book is teaching of Buddhist faith, not the usual Hinayana Buddhistic faith, but Mahayana Buddhist faith. So Mahayana is kind of the essense of Buddhist faith, or object of faith we believe in. So Mahayana is the object of faith, because maha means essense of being or ultimate nature of what is here and now, so that is really the object of our faith. But it is very pure, because the maha is the essense of being, which embraces all sentient beings and carries them. So it is very pure function. That’s why the object of faith is something very pure, beyond human control, human speculation. Completely pure and clean. That’s why the person who wants to believe in that, believes in the faith, believe in that object, the essense of being, very naturally the person becomes very pure. Because if you believe in or if you think of this essence of being, very naturally you must be pure and clean. Even though you think even for a moment, you think so, you become very clean and pure. So that’s why if you believe this essence of being you become pure. So in Buddhism says faith is pure and clean. Pureness and cleanness. Purity and cleanness, this is the meaning of faith. 

So we should awaken this faith. How? That’s why here is the explanation of how we should awaken this Buddhist faith. This is this book.

So first, let’s see this structure of this book. This is a very common structure which the Buddhist treatise follows. First, the introduction, then main subject, and conclusion. Three points. That is introduction is invocation. This is very common structure the Buddhist treatise follows. Always there is an invocation, and main subject, this is the main subject, and also this is a very important point this book really teaches us. 

So main subject consists of five parts. Part 1: The Reasons for Writing. So why did Ashvaghosha want to write this book. [There are] eight reasons there. Part 2: Outline. So one mind, its two aspects, its three characteristics. That outline is ... already that outline is explanation of the interpretation, or Part 4, Part 5. ... Part 3, part 4, part 5 explains about one mind is two aspects and its three characteristics. 

One mind means the truth. Truth means one mind, only one mind – *mind only*. Human beings, trees, birds, winter, anyway all existence, all beings are based on the same and one ground. We call [this] one mind. 

So one mind, and its two aspects. Two aspects means, in part 3 there are chapter 1, chapter 2, chapter 3. In chapter 1 chapter 2, [the] revelation of the true meaning, causation of evil attachment. And also next is the under the revelation of the true meaning, there is the mind on terms of the truth, the mind in terms of phenomena. Two aspects means the mind in terms of the truth, the mind in terms of phenomena. So one mind can be seen in terms of two aspects: the truth, and also arising and ceasing [of] beings. All sentient beings are born and disappear like this, birth and death. So from two aspects one mind is seen. That is two aspects.

Three characteristics means, one is essence, second is attributes, [third is] functioning. So all sentient beings are based on three characteristics, one is essence, second is attributes, third is function. 

Essence is kind of a disciple (principle). So if all sentient beings exist in this world, there is a reason why it exists. Nothing exists at random with no reason. Nothing. So there is always a reason why it exists. Even though evil or devils, right or wrong, even though wind always breaks or destroys trees or houses, even a tornado destroys human beings, houses, nature, still it has a reason why it exists. There is a [principle]. So from this point, even the tornado is entitled to live in this world. You cannot destroy it. So that is a [principle]. 

And also, all sentient beings exist in this world, it has always attribute. Attribute means form, it has always form, marks. And also the marks, form which people can see through the six senses. That is attributes. 

And also function. So if all sentient beings has a form and marks, they always function. They always function, in many ways. 

So those are the three characteristics. 

**Question:** You said discipline under essence. The three characteristics are essence, attribute, and function. Where did you get discipline in there? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Discipline means reason why, the reason for the existence. (Principle.)

The one mind, its two aspects, its three characteristics in a sense describe about the maha, in this case. We say Mahayana, what is maha. But in this book, maha is described by one mind, its two aspects, and its three characteristics. And also part 4, there are four faiths and five practices. And excellent skillfulness – something like this. That is the meaning of maha. 

Okay, revelation of the truth and mind in terms of the absolute. The next line, the two kinds of truth, emptiness and non-emptiness. So mind in terms of the truth is described from three points, two kinds of truth, emptiness or non-emptiness. Well, I don’t want to explain gradually to understand this one. 

Briefly I want to explain this one. Chapter 1, the Revelation of the True Meaning. So very naturally we know the outline of what this book [says], so truths, what is the one mind, so here it says revelation of true meaning, under this this book mentions the mind in terms of the two truths, the mind in terms of phenomena. Chapter 2: the [correction] of evil attachments. Next says, the correction of two attachments to a person and dharma. Causation of evil attachment. So if you understand the truths, the mind in terms of the truth, the mind in terms of phenomena, there is still some problem that is attachment to a person and dharma. This is a strong attachment we have. So we have to correct this. That is Chapter 2: Causation of Evil Attachments. 

Chapter 3: Analysis of the Types of Aspiration for Enlightenment. So, how we practice. This is our aspiration for enlightenment, so we should know what enlightenment is, how to accomplish, how to attain enlightenment. This is analysis of the types of aspiration for enlightenment. 

[Chapter 4] On Faith. So interpretation is most important in this book. So very concretely it explains what meaning of the truth and how to practice, what are the obstacles for us in order to reach the truth. And [Chapter] 4 is our practice. Practice for determined class of people who have non-backsliding faith, very strong faith. For those people, how we practice. But on the other hand there are people who have backsliding faith of undetermined class of people. So for those people, how we practice, how we awaken Mahayana faith. That is [Chapter] 4. 

And Chapter 5, we try to encourage all sentient beings also to reach Buddha’s way. So how? So there is this encouragement of the practice and benefit. For instance, Buddha’s way, essence of beings is very pure and clean. So even for a moment let’s think of it. In other words usually we say let’s live in a positive way. Very often we say so. And Buddha is very valuable and helpful for us. So let’s to have access to the Buddha’s teaching as best as we can, as much as possible we try. Something like this. So that is encouragement. How we awaken Buddhist Mahayana faith. That is Chapter 5. 

The conclusion is the verse of parinama, parinama is dedication. Dedication or parinama means eko in Japanese. Eko means turns the merits of your practice to another. If you do something, very naturally you can get a result. But that result is not something you should hold on by yourself. You should share it with the people. So as best as we can we should do something good every day, because if you do something good, that goodness guides you to have close access to the Buddha Way, instead of doing something wrong. If you do something wrong, that activity keeps you away from the essence of being or ultimate nature of beings; very naturally it keeps you away, slip off, going far from that. That’s why as best as we can we should do something good. If we do something good, very naturally you can have access, you can find the way to have access to the Buddha Way. So that is eko, dedication, we say parinama. So in Buddhism parinama is very beautiful thought, human thought. We do something good and then we can get the result, but that result should be shared with all sentient beings. So very naturally there is the practice of egolessness. If you do something good, very naturally people try to hold on. But let it go. So next, you can get enlightenment, but next, let it go. The practice of letting go is very difficult for us, because we want to hold on. If through the practice of zazen if you experience something wonderful, you really want to keep it for a long time. But you cannot do it, actually. So very naturally, the rhythm of human life shows you the practice of letting go. But we don’t do it. That’s why actually you try to hold it. But nature of beings lets you learn how to let it go. That’s why human beings in a sense create lots of ego and attachment. To you, to the teaching, to the object, that is the dharma and attachment to the dharma, and a person. So the verse of parinama, this is the conclusion. 

And also, the introduction, invocation. Whatever kind of book is written, the author has a certain purpose why, particularly the author tried to write something on the basis of full devotion to the triple treasure. So that is the invocation. Invocation is written in the strong devotion toward the triple treasure. 

#### 30:55

Do you have questions? 

**Question:** Hojo-san, when you say that this book has to do with awakening Mahayana faith as opposed to Hinayana, what is it? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yes. I said Hinayana, but Maha doesn’t mean great as opposed to small. No. I don’t mean this. But the term Mahayana is used very naturally opposed to Hinayana. So Mahayana is the understanding Buddha’s Way in a broad perspective. But in this case, the term maha doesn’t mean great opposed to small.

**Question:** Okay. Does Hinayana mean just like cultivating ones own psychological...

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yes, that is a very common understanding of this. 

#### 32:48

**Question:** Hojo-san, you said there are different practices for those with non-backsliding faith and those with backsliding faith. How do you know if you have backsliding faith or non-backsliding faith? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** *[Chuckles.]* Well, I think you can know pretty well in your everyday life. In spiritual life, you can’t always stay in strong spiritual faith. Even though you believe that you have strong spiritual faith, still within the faith, you can see the up and down slide. Sometimes you don’t want, sometimes you want. Sometimes you have doubt, you become very skeptical. Apparently you do zazen strongly, you believe Buddhism, but still there is skeptical doubt. So doubt and skepticism are kind of, this is kind of backsliding your faith. 

So more or less, you have this kind of backsliding faith. In order to have not-backsliding faith, you have to practice for a long time. But basically, we are already living in the realm of unbacksliding faith, because we are already embraced by the essence of existence, being. Even though you realize or you don’t realize, you are embraced by the universe. So from this point, wherever you may go, you are always at the stage of not-backsliding faith already. But we don’t see it. That’s a problem for us. That’s why we have to notice, we have to realize it, and we have to practice it. 

#### 36:08

**Question:** Why are there different kinds of practices? If everybody is both backsliding and non-backsliding, why do they [have] different kinds of practices?

**Katagiri Roshi:** Because everyone has different kinds of lifestyles. I think basically all sentient beings live in the same and one ground, from this point all sentient beings become equal. But each one is different. Tree is different, bird is different. So very naturally many kinds of human beings there. But through the different characteristics, different personalities, different lifestyles, different form of beings, we have to realize the same and one ground, so-called faith, the essence of the universe. We have to find it. That’s why there are many practices.

#### 39:15

**Question:** ... faith, does that mean faith in dharma? What is it faith in? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Sure, we can say dharma. Because dharma is the essence of being; three meanings, essence of being, and phenomena, and ... teaching. That is called dharma. So what we should believe in, generally speaking, we say dharma, we can believe dharma. So we can believe in the essence of beings as dharma, we can believe in the phenomenal world as dharma. We can believe in the dharma as the phenomenal world, because phenomenal world is not something different from essence of existence. So that’s why we believe the dharma as the essence of beings and as the phenomenal world, and also we believe in the teaching. That is belief. 

In this book, faith is described in more detail .... 

*[Tape change.]*

Let’s read the invocation, page 23. 

> I take refuge in the Buddha, the greatly Compassionate One, the Savior of the world, omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient, of most excellent deeds in all the ten directions; And in the Dharma, the manifestation of his Essence, the Reality, the sea of Suchness, the boundless storehouse of excellencies; And in the Sangha, whose members truly devote themselves to the practice. May all sentient beings be made to discard their doubts, to cast aside their evil attachments, and to give rise to the correct faith in the Mahayana, that the lineage of the Buddhas may not be broken off.

“the lineage of the Buddhas” means originally [it said] *seed* of the Buddha. Seed of the Buddha: we try to maintain, we try to continue the seed of the Buddha. That means the seed of universal life. Everything has universal life. *[There is some discussion about the word seed.]* But in this translation here, it says the lineage of the Buddha. 

That’s why in the invocation we take refuge in the Buddha, triple treasure: Buddha, Dharma, Sangha. So, “I take refuge in the Buddha.” Take refuge is called nama or namo kimyo, ki is return, myo means life. So take refuge in the Buddha is return to Buddha with life. In other words, you have to devote yourself to return to the essence of existence, to the Buddha, with life. So you have to offer your life; you offer your life to Buddha. That is big, huge devotion. Not only thinking, okay? You cannot offer yourself, offer your life to the Buddha in terms of egoistic sense, you cannot do it. So you need the great, enormous effort, enormous compassion. You should offer your life. Something more than to risk your life, okay? Kind of risk your life, but risking your life is very egoistic. But to take refuge in Buddha is kind of risking your life but very elegant. Elegant behavior must be based on. 

So, “I take refuge in the Buddha,” that is kimyo, take refuge. In English we say take refuge, but in Sanskrit we say namo. Namo is translated as kimyo in Japanese, it means return to the Buddha with your life. Do you understand? Full devotion to the Buddha. 

“the greatly Compassionate One” – so One is the Buddha – very compassionate. Because compassion comes from the bottom of existence. When you touch the core of existence, very naturally compassion comes up. I always say, just like your water pipe touches the water vein, very naturally water comes up. Just like this. So if you understand very deeply the human world, then naturally compassion comes up. Wherever you may be, compassion is there. 

So “greatly Compassionate One,” this is the Buddha. And the Buddha is to have this compassion, and also to awaken this compassion to let others awaken with compassion. So that is called Buddha. Buddha awakens himself. To have awakened to compassion, and simultaneously to let others awaken to compassion. 

“the Savior of the world” – so if you have this great compassion, very naturally you can help all sentient beings. So we say Savior. I don’t know savior. Savior of the world. 

I don’t know how I can say, in the Chinese it says, “supreme karma” instead of greatly compassionate one, the Savior of the world, originally it says “supreme karma,” supreme activities. Because that is Buddha’s intention, or Buddha’s will. Buddha’s will is always something supreme, and what would you say, always moving toward the essence of existence, on the basis of compassion. So Buddha’s intention or will lets him do something good always, under all circumstances. That is “greatly compassionate one, the savior of the world.” At that time, he will become great Buddha who helps all sentient beings. 

“omnipotent” – I don’t know how to say. Omnipotent means Buddha’s body. “omnipotent, omniscient.” 

Oh excuse me, let me say – “the greatly compassionate one, the savior of the world, omnipotent, omniscient, of most excellent deeds in all the ten directions”. Already, yes, yes. Most excellent deeds or activity, I mentioned. 

Let me say, Buddha – excuse me, I said a little bit something wrong. I didn’t notice “the most excellent deeds in all the ten directions.” Buddha’s activity is always excellent or supreme. “In all the ten directions” means the implication of space. But not only space, but also the time process. Including time and space, Buddha is always doing something good, for all sentient beings. So in all ten directions means, for all sentient beings who exist in space and time. That is called in the ten directions. So Buddha has most excellent deeds for all sentient beings. 

And next, what is most excellent deeds for all sentient beings? That is great compassionate one, he is great compassionate one. That’s why his deeds are very excellent. One by one, it says “the great compassionate one, Buddha,” his deeds are very compassionate, and also he is helping all sentient beings, the human world, that’s why “savior of the world.” That is his deeds.

And also “omnipotent, omnipresent.” Omnipotent means Buddha’s body is always functioning freely, helping. According to the characteristic of the person, according to the circumstances, Buddha helps. So that is “omnipotent.” Buddha’s body is working freely, functioning freely. That is “omnipotent, omnipresent.”

And also it says, “omniscient.” “Omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient” means the implication of how Buddha’s body is functioning, completely freely. 

And also, that is Buddha, so that’s why we have we take refuge in the Buddha. We are Buddha, already. That’s why we try to do as a Buddha, we try to behave as a Buddha. We are already Buddha, that’s why we have to show it, we have to act as a Buddha. If you are not Buddha, it’s not necessary to practice, you know? We are Buddha, that’s why we have to act as a Buddha. If you are not Buddha, you cannot act as a Buddha. 

And the next, “we take refuge in the dharma.” Dharma is the manifestation of its essence. The essence of being, that is Buddhist dharma. And the reality, the essence of beings is in a sense called the reality. Real reality, we can say so. So the reality you live in is really essence of being. So you don’t know, you cannot touch it, you cannot pin down what reality is, what is reality, what is the place you live in. It’s vast. The more you research, the more you don’t know. It’s very big, vast. That is reality. 

So manifestion of dharma is manifestation of his essence, essence of beings, or sometimes it is called reality. What is this? This is kind of a sea of suchness. Suchness is truth, or vastness of existence. So reality or essence of beings is really vast as the sea. And also the boundless storehouse of excellence, wonderful things in it. That’s why we have to practice patience. Under all circumstances, unfavorable or favorable conditions, anyway we have to practice patience, and we have to make effort, we have to take care of with discipline, and we have to practice meditation and wisdom. Meditation means tranquility [...], and wisdom is clear observation. We say sometimes vipassana. Meditation is called shamata, shamata is one-pointedness. Very naturally your mind, your body becomes tranquil. So meditation is the implication of the practice of tranquilization, and wisdom is clear observation, by which you can see the essence of human life, which is going up and down, up and down. So core of existence, core of the human world, samsaric world, we can see it, by wisdom. That’s why clear observation, we say vipassana. 

So very naturally we have the boundless storehouse of excellency. That is dharma. That’s why, whatever happens, let’s learn the dharma, believe in the dharma, and devote yourself to the dharma, constantly. This is great encouragement.

Next, “in the sangha, whos members truly devote themselves to the practice.” Even though there are Buddha and dharma, we need the sangha who’s members are interested in practicing buddha and dharma. We need the human beings who live now, today. Otherwise, we cannot transmit, we cannot convey buddha and dharma to the next generation. 

So that is sangha. Truly devote themselves to the practice. So sangha members of the buddhism is person who devotes himself to the practice, on the basis of Buddhist teaching. 

So there are three, always the author has a great vow, why he has to write this book. So he has very profoundly vow of devoting himself to buddha, dharma, sangha. This is very important for this author. So he devotes himself with his life, to write this book. To write this book means to help all sentient beings. Not help only the human intellect, but helping human intellect and human emotion and also human will. Intellect, emotion, and will. And then, the final goal is to be free from human intellection, human emotion, human will. That is the vow, to take refuge in the triple treasure. 

So Buddhist belief is to believe dharma. What do you mean, to believe in dharma? To believe in dharma is to take refuge in the triple treasure, buddha, dharma, sangha. What is the buddha? Buddha is a person who constantly has something good, helping. Even just his presence is very helpful. So that is buddha. And historically, Buddha is Gotama Siddhartha, Shakyamuni Buddha. Who existed in human history, that’s why believe, we trust this person. And that this person tells us, all sentient beings, all of you, are buddha, exactly the same as Buddha Shakyamuni. He proved this, twenty-five hundred years ago. So we trust, we believe in this historical person Shakyamuni Buddha, and simultaneously, next we believe in his teaching, so-called “we are buddha.” So if you believe in the dharma, very naturally there is a practice that is we take refuge in the buddha, and we exist in this human world as a human being but simultaneously more than a human being, that is holiness, something like this. But it’s not good enough, because we have to believe in his teaching, the teaching of his life. That is the teaching, dharma. 

And next, we have to devote ourselves to the sangha, people who are always practicing the teaching and believing in the buddha. This is the sangha. Sangha is we take refuge in the people who exist and practice buddha and buddha’s teaching. So that is the contents, quality of believing in dharma. So that’s why triple treasure is very important. So Buddhist faith is not to believe in something divine, or holiness. You have to be in holiness, and also to his teaching, and also the people who practice buddha and holiness and also his teaching. So very vast. Buddhist faith is very vast. And buddhist faith is very grounded in human life, because you have to believe human beings who practice buddha’s way, Buddha’s teaching. So that is the sangha. That’s why sangha is important. 

“May all sentient beings be made to discard their doubts, to cast aside their evil attachments, and to give rise to the correct faith in the Mahayana, that the lineage of the Buddhas may not be broken off.” 

“May all sentient beings be made to discard their doubts”. One point is he takes a vow to take refuge in the Triple Treasure, that is the reason why he wants to let all sentient to be made to discard their doubts. Human beings have lots of doubts. Toward the essence of existence, and also the teaching about the essence of the beings. So lots of doubts, so he removes their doubts. 

“To cast aside their evil attachments” – the human beings possess very strong evil attachments, to the self, and to its object, based on attachment, consciously or unconsciously. The more you practice and you study Buddhism, the more you realize how strongly your attachment is functioning. 

And “to give rise to correct faith in the Mahayana.” So very naturally to give rise to correct faith in the Mahayana. And that means to maintain the seeds of the Buddha, which all sentient beings possess. “Seeds of the Buddha” means seeds of universal life. “may not be broken off.” 

Okay, do you have questions? 

#### 1:11:00

**Question:** Hojo-san? You said “we’re already Buddha, so we need to act like Buddha.” We’re already Buddha, and everything we do is the action of Buddha. Is that right? If we’re already Buddha, then everything we do is already the action of Buddha. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Mmm-hmm. 

**Question:** So what do we need to try to do?

**Katagiri Roshi:** Well that’s why we have to do it. But human beings don’t do it. Don’t you think so? Tree, birds, and sky, winter, work pretty well as buddha. But human beings don’t work in that way. Do you understand? 

For instance, when you do zazen, that is simple zazen. Buddha means, if you are buddha, and then you should act as a buddha in zazen means ... what do you mean by this? Zazen and you are not separated, zazen and you are interconnected, interpenetrated, having great, wonderful created world, created life there, between zazen and you. Very nice creation there, created life. But we don’t do it. But look at the trees and winter. Wonderful creation there. But we don’t do it. We always doing zazen, we’re always complaining, and daydreaming, always thinking, chasing after thoughts. Don’t you think so? We are always creating a gap between zazen and you, always. So it’s very difficult to create universal life, created life. I say group creation, okay? *[He laughs.]* By the sangha you have to have group creation, wonderful creation in life. That means each person must communicate very closely; don’t create a gap. But that is very difficult. If you live like this, very naturally you are fighting, you know? In many ways. Competing, always. But look at the trees and birds, and winter. Very naturally, there is wonderful creation there. That’s why we are really caught by the beauty of nature. Completely beyond human speculation: why do you like nature? You like it. Because we can see it. That’s a beautiful scene. We have [it] already, that’s why we can see that something beautiful which nature has. But actually we don’t do it, that’s why we are really caught by nature and dream that nature. At that time, we forget completely how to practice this. So always dreaming, and exciting the beauty of nature. That’s why people want to go to nature, et cetera. Well we have to practice, anyway. We have to live our lives just like nature. That is called “act as a buddha.”

That is, from day to day you have to practice, anyway. There is no end. Day to day, you have to do it.
