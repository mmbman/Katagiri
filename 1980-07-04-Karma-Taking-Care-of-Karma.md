#### 0:00 start of recording

This is my last talk for this week. Next week I would like to talk about karma from a little bit different angle, *[unintelligible]* according to Dogen, *[unintelligible]* in *Shōbōgenzō* on karma. So I would like to talk about karma according to Dogen: how he understands [and] accepts karma. That is the topic next week. [For] today’s last [talk], as much as possible I would like to have a conclusion.

In Buddhism, meditation is called *dhyāna*. But if you really start to study Buddhism, *dhyāna* [or] meditation is not a simple practice, it’s pretty deep. Most people handle meditation as a means to make your life strong, et cetera. But this is just a little bit, you really understand just a little bit of meditation in Buddhism. The more you practice meditation, you really realize how deep meditation is. In your whole life you should understand what meditation is, and through the meditation you should understand [your life]. To understand meditation is exactly the same as understanding your life, okay? Exactly. So that’s why I told you in *[unintelligible]*, in order to understand karma, there is no other way but just to do zazen. That is the best way, anyway.

So to understand meditation, dhyāna, is exactly to understand *you*, human life, and also karma. I don’t want to poke my head into the complicated explanation of dhyāna according to tradition, but just outline it.

#### 3:55

For instance, first, the world is divided into three categories. The first world is *the world of desire*. The second is *the world of form*. The third *the world of formlessness*. Simply speaking, that is one of the understandings of the world, that we call the *triple world*. But if you use the term triple world, there are two meanings. One is the world of desire, and form, and formlessness. The other meaning is the world of the past, present, and future. That is the triple world. 

So briefly speaking, we understand the world as the triple world. First [we understand] the world is the world of desire. This is really the common human world, filled with human desire: good or bad, right or wrong, confusion, suffering, and many things. The second world is the world of form. In other words, this world has no sense of desire, but the material entities remain, material world remains. *Material world* means not only material things, but even the spiritual things become material, if you attach to them. Do you understand this? You can know [about] Trungpa’s book, *Spiritual Materialism*. If you really attach to, really handle the spiritual world according to individual prepossessions or prejudice, the spiritual world turns into the material world. In other words, you don’t understand the spiritual world exactly as it is. The spiritual world is understood in a very narrow way; at that time it becomes the material world. It doesn’t make sense, it doesn’t work in the human world. Even though you have spiritual experience, if it doesn’t work in your life, it’s still a material thing, material entity. That is the world of form. 

And third is the world of formlessness. This is just the spiritual world. So we call this *mushiki-kai*. *Mu* is non. *Shiki* is *rupa*; in Sanskrit *rupa* means to get something in a dualistic way. Usually *rupa* is translated as *form*, but *rupa* in Sanskrit means to get something in a dualistic way. In other words, always separating: seeing something, hearing something separately, between subject and object. That is what is called *rupa*: form, the material world, dualistic world. So *mushiki* means [non] *rupa*, non-form: *formlessness*. 

#### 9:15

So zazen, *dhyāna*, does not take place in the world of desire. The practice of dhyāna starts in the world of form. There is no *dhyāna* in the world of desire. That’s an interesting point. Do you understand? 

I told you before that dhyāna takes place in the world of form: at that time we have a system of *dhyāna* which is called the four stages. Do remember? I told you this briefly. 

In the first stage of dhyāna, all unwholesome human behaviors *drop off*, exactly. You don’t believe this, but this is really true! In other words, the world of desires drops off. For instance, if you sit down like this, even though you get angry, you cannot express anger, or you cannot hit somebody. Anyway when you sit down, *sit down*, that’s all. Even though someone comes and gets angry and tries to hit you, it’s pretty to hit the person who is sitting quietly. Well, maybe somebody there *[he laughs]*, but don’t worry. 

There are lots of stories [about this] in the history of Buddhism. Somebody was about to be killed by their enemies, and at that time that person said, “Well just a second, before you kill me, I would like to talk with you, drinking *sake*.” *[He laughs.]* Anyway, they drink *sake* ... and then very naturally there is communication there. The samurai who was about to kill an enemy, they now communicate with each-other, and then very [friendly]. *[Laughter.]* 

It’s not a trick, anyway. But you cannot do it in that way, because if you are on the verge of life and death, you really become nervous and confused. You cannot have such a wonderful faith. Can you imagine? 

#### 13:08

So in the first stage of dhyāna, there are no unwholesome human behaviors, they drop off. That’s why the practice of meditation cannot start in the human world of desire. 

And very naturally there are five consciousness experienced. Should I explain that again? ... Do you want to know? *[Laughter.]*

Well, simply speaking, in the first stage of dhyāna, strongly there is still thought and discursive thinking there. So constantly you are thinking, again and again. But whatever you think in zazen, all becomes images. Even pain: pain is something you believe as something real, but it’s still imagination. Because if you stand up, it’s gone. So all things become imagination. Finally, there is nothing to get in your hand. That’s why you’re always chasing after images, escaping from this, and also staying and enjoying, with imagination. That is what is called daydreaming; constant daydreaming. But if you stay with the daydream, it’s really exhausting. You cannot stay *[unintelligible]* in the daydream. So finally, even though you like or dislike [them], very naturally all daydreams drop off. So all you have to do is just sit down.

That’s why you feel *prīti*. It’s *prīti* in Sanskrit, and *pīti* in Pali. That is *joyful interest*. So very naturally you can experience joyful interest. But in the realm of joyful interest, still the six consciousnesses are always poking their head into each experience; that is joyful interest. And also you experience not *prīti* but *sukha*: this is *happiness*. In the realm of happiness, there is no function of six consciousnesses. Of course you have six consciousnesses, but it means you have the six consciousnesses but they don’t bother you, because you become exactly one with zazen. That is what is called *sukha*, happiness. 

That is everyone’s experience. That’s why if you really become one with zazen, that’s exactly the same as you become one with you. It’s the same thing. Zazen and you are different. If you completely become one with zazen, that is exactly same as you become you as you are. So you feel good. But intellectually you don’t like zazen, but beyond your speculation, you like it. Because why? You don’t know. But it happens, which is called sukha. 

So the happiness you have used is a little different. [That] happiness is always happiness opposed to unhappiness. But that happiness is always still... according to common sense that happiness is still sort of joyful interest; still the six consciousness poke their head into each hole; “what’s in it?” That’s not happiness. If you believe that is happiness, that is really happiness opposed to unhappiness. So happiness is exactly happiness, becoming one with zazen ... painting, playing piano, whatever it is. Exactly. And also your consciousness is really clear. But it’s to become one. At that time it’s called sukha, happiness. 

So at the first stage, you can experience samadhi and sukha and prīti and also vitarka and vicāra. Vitarka means thought and vicāra is discursive thinking. So particularly vitarka and vicāra, thought and discursive thinking, drop off. That is second stage of dhyāna. And then you can experience strongly the prīti and sukha. Also at that time that is called mindfulness, because you can be mindful. What is truth? But that truth is only a dim image of the truth, but you can be mindful of the image of the truth. Because still there is prīti, there is joyful interest, which your six consciousnesses poke their head into it. So the six consciousnesses poke their head into the truth. So that is the image of the truth. 

The third, prīti drops off, and just happiness and samadhi, and also mindfulness there. Because you can be mindful, samadhi, and also truth. In other words oneness between zazen and you. And then that is really mindful. Mindful means not forget. Not forget the state of being who is right in the middle of the truth. This is mindfulness. Do you understand? Mindfulness ... very practical belief. Belief is not something you can ... in your mind. Mindfulness is really practical belief. You can be mindful of a state of you who is present constantly in the truth. This is mindfulness. So mindfulness means not forget the truth. That’s why not forget the truth, this is mindfulness. Or, you can be present there. You can be mindful of your life, which is present constantly in the truth. This is mindfulness. So at the third stage of zazen, you can experience this.

At the fourth stage, the last one, even happiness drops off. Because happiness is still a trace of happiness, or form of happiness remains. You still “hang around” happiness. So real happiness if you become one with happiness, no trace of happiness. So it’s not necessary to bring up, “I am happy, I am happy.” It’s not necessary to say. Do you understand? If you really become happy, at that time you cannot say anything. Or same applies to suffering: if you really suffer from something, you cannot say anything. So suffering and happiness are basically the same. If you really suffer from something, you cannot say anything. So suffering and happiness are basically the same. If you really experience suffering, you can touch it of course. At that time, no words. For instance: cry, sad. Sad is sad. But real sadness is not sadness, you can ... If you touch the core of sadness, you get love. Or happiness: at that time, you can cry. Don’t you think so? Look at ... the Miss America contest. *[Laughter.]* Miss Universe, you know? If you get first prize, she cries, always. That is the highest level of happiness. *[Everyone laughs.]*

So happiness and suffering are basically the same. So if you really experience real happiness, there is no trace of happiness [where] you can say “this is happiness.” Why do you feel happy? You don’t know, you cannot say. You have lots of things you want to explain, but nothing becomes words. 

So at the last stage of zazen, you cannot say anything. So happiness drops off. There is only samadhi and mindfulness. Exactly mindfulness, and also samadhi, and also ... equanimity. In sanskrit we say *upeksha*. Literally upeksha means throwing away, abandoning, but this is not throwing away, abandoning, upeksha means to accept all human life, including all in equality. At that time you can experience equanimity, peace. Which is called spiritual security; equanimity is spiritual security. Or religious belief, or faith – whatever you say. Well, if you don’t want to use the term faith, that is according to my term, that is spiritual security. 

#### 

That is zazen takes place in the word form. And also the question is still four stages of zazen in the world of formlessness. That is really deep. *[He laughs.]* We don’t understand. I will give you just the name of the four stages of zazen in the world of formlessness. One is “the infinity of space”; this is the first stage. Second, “the infinity of consciousness.” Third, “nothing to resort to.” The fourth, “a state of concentration which goes beyond the matter of whether [nothing is allowed] or not.” Completely you can’t say anything at all. Nothing. All you have to do is just be present. Just be present. This is the final goal, anyway. *[He chuckles.]* This is the last stage of ... just like a fish swimming in the water. Even though he doesn’t use his own consciousness, but he doesn’t ignore the function of consciousness, because he has consciousness, but it’s doesn’t bother fishes’ action/opportunity. Fish just swims in the water, dynamically, always. That is really the last stage of zazen in the world of formlessness. 

At that time, if you really practice zazen constantly, you never change. You cannot change you. According to the psychological point of view, you try to change somebody... *[He laughs.]* But you cannot change. So forget it. What you can change is *attitude*, attitude toward human life. How do you take care of this table, and gassho, and zazen, that is attitude toward. That you can change. By the teachings, and by deep understanding, you can change your attitude. That is the best. 

So the final goal of meditation is not to change personality or whatever it is. The point is to understand deeply human life. That means zazen. Understand deeply the meaning of zazen, meditation, connected directly with human life. And then, at that time, something happens. This is. Completely you can return to human being as it is. But this human being or person is nothing different from the beginning, the person in the first stage. Briefly speaking, we usually understand that mountains are mountains. This is according to common sense. The second stage, we have to understand a little deeply, that’s why we said mountains are not mountains. And then the final goal is mountains are mountains. That mountains are mountains is a little different from the mountains are mountains in the first stage, because your understanding is deeper, related with you and all sentient beings, and the clouds, the sky, the sun, the moon. That’s why you really understand the total picture of the mountains. The total picture of the mountains means the mountains life including the clouds, the sky, the heavens and hells, all things. And then becoming one. This is really the beauty of existence the mountain has. That is the last stage. 

So when you study zazen and practice zazen, you can understand human beings as human beings. Second, you can go through a little bit negative aspect of human understanding. And third, finally you can go ... overcome this negation of human life. At that time you really can open your eyes and see everything, and accept everything. That is really the final goal, which is called mountains are mountains. That is so you can return to human [life] again. But when you return to human [life] again, that human life is really nothing special. “Just be present,” but that just be present is really ... to everybody. 

#### 

That is the last stage of zazen in the world of formlessness. But what I want to tell you is, according to Buddhist tradition, it is last stage, but Buddhist teaching always says still there is what is called perception. That’s an interesting point: even though you reach the final goal, still the perception still remains in your life. 

That is perception means ... let me say something about this. In Buddhist Psychology, there are five consciousness operating, working constantly. Whatever event happens, whatever you do, constantly, good or bad, right or wrong or neutral, whatever behavior you do, constantly there are human consciousnesses working. That is the five consciousnesses. First one is *contact*; in Sanskrit we say *sparśa*. And second is *feeling*, [in Sanskrit it is] *vedanā*. Third [is] perception, *saṃjñā*. Next is thought, *cetanā*. Fifth is mind, *citta*. Those five consciousnesses are constantly working there, in whatever situation. That’s an interesting point. 

#### 

Contact, sparśa, this is not the contact which you have usually thought. According to psychology, I don’t know how you understand contact. But in Buddhism, contact is the idea of contact psychological point of view. Contact is a little broad. For instance contact is just like a pillar in the building. Big pillars always supporting, connecting with the rest of the rafters, and many things. And supporting the whole building. And also it has always ... each of them has recognized differences, and form a harmoniously connected whole. This is sparśa. Can you imagine. So sparśa is “contact as a whole”. This is very powerful; just like to goats fighting each other with their [horns]. Do you understand? It’s really bumping each other; this is contact. 

So that is really creating a certain function that when it works, just like hitting each other. At that time, something happens. That is what is called *feeling*, *vedanā*. And vedanā is...  reception, to receive something. If you bump each other, your consciousness six organs, contact with six objects, and then at that time, there is a big shock [like] two goats fighting. Immediately you can get a shock. If you get a shock, your body starts to work. That is feeling, vedanā. So you immediately receive something. 

And when you receive something, there is function which is called grasping. Grabbing, or attaching to something. This is a quality of vedanā, feeling. And also where vedanā is located, that’s interesting. Essentially vedanā, feeling is very quiet, tranquil. Feeling is really tranquil. You don’t know that, but [in] the original nature of vedanā it is very true. The original nature of vedanā creates wholesome behavior in the human mind. This is original nature of human feeling. That’s why through feeling you can create religious sense, and artistic sense. That’s why we educate little boys ... you know the Japanese teachers of guitar musicians? Mr. Suzuki. He always teaches music to the little children? The don’t understand music ... but originally human beings have feeling. That feeling is really ... accepting. By bumping into each other, getting a big shock, that is contact. So very naturally you can educate that feeling. Particularly in small children, it’s pretty easy to grow, to educate such a quiet, tranquil feeling. That’s why Mr. Suzuki always teaches in that way. 

The same applies to not only music. Religion, or sports, or whatever it is, that is ... when you teach somebody when you are small, that’s pretty good. Even language, too. But not only teaching in a linguistic way, but teaching language through human feeling; they can get language through the human feeling. So the teacher can teach in that way. 

In Japan particularly music teachers pay careful attention to people who are under twenty. That is a very good time to teach somebody, in order to be a good musician or carpenter, whatever it is. That’s a pretty good age. Maybe you know pretty well when you are in high school, you can just concentrate on studying and memorizing each English term and Japanese term, whatever. Writing the term on a card, I memorized the English term. One night before the examination started, I memorized. I didn’t forget the next day. But afterwards, when I went to university, I did the same way, memorizing the English term. Next day, I forgot everything! *[He laughs.]* So you know how different it is? Before twenty, it’s really easy to memorize, because your life is very simple, simpler than people over twenty. If you’re over twenty, lots of things happen. *[Laughter.]*

So that’s why they always concentrate on educating young people. We have to educate the person who’s three years old in order to grow such human feelings, which is tranquil. So that is this little children learn human feeling through relationship with parents, and the teachers, et cetera. That is feeling, okay? Vedanā. 

#### 45:24

Next is *saṃjñā*; that is *perception*. This is a very interesting thing. Perception is ... just like carpenter who recognizes what kind of wood they have to use. Recognition of the wood. ...

*[Tape change.]*
  
  ... put the mark. This is quality of perception. Put the mark means if you put the mark, that putting the mark reminds you what kind of wood you should use. That means re-recognition. So first recognition, and second quality of perception re-recognition. If you recognize something you immediately put a mark on your object. So that putting the mark on the object is immediately re-recognition. You can know later what kind of wood you should use, so re-cognition. 
  
At that time, very naturally the function of perception is to attach individual understanding. Because the carpenter understands what kind of wood he needs. But that is the individual carpenter’s understanding of wood. So that’s why he puts the mark on the wood. This is individual understanding. For instance, if you understand zazen, or Christianity, whatever, you have experience of Christianity and Zen, you understand. That is recognition. And then you put a mark on Christianity. That is your individual understanding. And then this individual understand is really re-cognize. You re-cognize what kind of wood you need. Finally you say that is Christianity, and you really attach to individual understanding. That is the function of perception. 
  
That is just like a blind man touching the elephant. There is an interesting story in the Buddhist scriptures. The king brings an elephant, and invites the blind man to know what it is. One blind man touches the ears of the elephant, and he says “the elephant is just like a big fan.” Another is touching the legs, and say, “Oh, the elephant is just like a pillar!” That is really the function of perception. 

Another characteristic of perception is perception cannot reach the depth of object. So perception occurs for very short period of time, just like lightning. For instance, just like ... you walk in the countryside in the evening. The road is a little dark and you cannot see clearly what is in the road. But all of a sudden you notice sort of a long string there, a rope. And then immediately you scream, “Snake!” That is really perception. Immediately perception starts work. But perception doesn’t have enough space to understand what it is. Very quick; touch it and understand what it is. That is perception. 

But this perception is also working with wisdom. Wisdom is very quick sometimes, just like lightning. So perception is not something bad; perception is also working with wisdom. For instance, if you do zazen, I experience the same thing. I told you maybe before, all Zen teachers always teach “zazen is useless,” but I didn’t understand this. Why do I have to do zazen [if it’s] useless? I didn’t understand, but I have to teach zazen, so that is really my *affliction*, which is called avidyā. *[He laughs.]* Ignorance. So, very difficult. But something compels me to teach, so every day I have to teach, studying and understanding with my best [effort]. But actually I didn’t understand. All of a sudden I understand the meaning of uselessness in zazen: “Ah! This is [it]!”  And then, I feel relief. I don’t know what it is, but immediately just like water rushing off from the bottom of a bucket, *[fwoosh]*. *[Laughter.]* I feel good. “Ah, this is uselessness! Right! This is zazen.” That’s good. So, that is maybe real zazen. That is perception. You really get such an experience through perception, because perception works with wisdom. 

#### 54:21

Okay, and next is *cetanā*. Cetanā is thought, and also volition or will. Cetanā is very important because it is the basis of karma. The basic of karma comes from this cetanā. cetanā is working whatever kinds of behavior you do, good, bad, or neutral, cetanā is there – thought. Thought is to think, contemplate. Thought, volition, or will. But at that time cetanā makes very wonderful effort, twice as much than other consciousnesses. cetanā is really using its energies to success, good behavior or evil behavior or neutral behavior, whatever it is. That is cetanā. 

Just like the boss of a company. If you have the position of supervisor or boss of a company, boss of company really uses great effort, twice as much as other people, employees. For instance in modern civilization, particularly in Japan, really .... *[Unintelligible]* So boss of the company really makes every possible effort, day after day, twice as much as other people, to create whatever kind of new product he should do. Day by day. That’s really hard work. 

And also cetanā supervises employees with his sort of order. So cetanā is orderly. cetanā has power to order somebody and organize and let employees work best way. At that time, cetanā uses really great effort, twice as much as other people. cetanā is the boss okay? Employees, that is human behaviors: good, or bad, or neutral. If you control or organize employees, that is good behavior. But if you fail to do [so], that is unwholesome. 

That’s why cetanā is individual experience, individual thing. cetanā is boss of the company. That is his business, great effort. But simultaneously, his behavior really influences other people. So exactly interconnected with others. Individual cetanā really influences other people. That is organizing the employees, et cetera. So individual cetanā is not individual; individual cetanā is simultaneously others’ cetanā. 

#### 59:26

And *citta* is mind; mind is to know and to understand, and also to communicate with object. This is the mind, citta: creating communications between subject and object, by understanding and knowing something. Analyzing, synthesizing. This is the mind, which is called citta. 

So five: *sparśa*, contact. *Vedanā*, feeling. And *saṃjñā*, perception. *Cetanā*, thought. And *citta*, mind. Those five always working. Whatever you do, those five are always working. Particularly *perception* remains, even after reaching the goal. That’s interesting. This is just like karma. And then, according to Buddhist tradition, you have to continue to practice in order to reach what is called *formless samadhi*. That is completely no form, nothing. That is what is called *jijiyu samadhi* in Japanese, or sometimes that is called ... to disport oneself in samadhi. It’s really you can be one with judo and kendo; your body is very flexible, round just like a bow. You can experience that. This is the final goal which is called *formless samadhi*. 

And then at that time, you can go beyond perception. But, still something there. That is human body and mind. Do you understand? Still there is something left; that is the human body, the human mind. Which exists right now. This is the final thing left. How can you take care of it? This is karma. It’s really karma.

That’s why Dogen Zenji says, I read the passage, he says “The Buddha Way is completely beyond the concept of being or not-being. That’s why there are human beings and buddhas, life and death, delusion and enlightenment, because everyone is a great being. If everything is great being, everything is entitled to live. Before you criticize, before you put a certain label, this is actual picture of human life.” That is what Dogen Zenji says. 

And next he says, “Nevertheless, flowers fall with human attachment.” For instance, if you see the beautiful flower, you say, “Oh please, stay on the branch, as long as you can, because you’re beautiful.” And “Weeds grow with hatred.” Well I didn’t read it exactly, but that is my translation, simply speaking, okay? Briefly speaking, he said, “Never the less, flowers fall with attachment, weeds grow with hatred.” We don’t want weeds in the garden ... but even though we hate it, weeds grow. That means completely that is ... Dogen really understands the final thing, what’s left, what remains after the final goal of religion. This is the human body, human mind, This human body or human mind is completely beyond being or not being, like or dislike. It’s *there*. It grows with hatred, it falls with attachment. When the time comes, you have to die, anyway. When the time comes, weeds grow. Even though you don’t like your life, anyway it grows. You have to grow. 

So that is the final thing that you have to do: how can you take care of this human body and mind? This is really nothing but karma. Karma means completely beyond your control. Anyway this is reality, fact. So if you understand the Buddha Way, everything is equal, wonderful, okay? And then finally, you should pay attention to you. There is something. This is not enlightenment, not Buddha, not ordinary people. Completely beyond that: this is your human body and mind. Given to you, as karma. 

That’s why, please, take care of this karma. Because everything is ... this body and mind is really in the stream of change, impermanence. Don’t attach too much, don’t hate too much. Anyway hate or attachment completely beyond. Take care of the human body and mind, with ... that is compassion. Without compassion, you cannot take care of this human body and mind. 

That’s why Dogen Zenji says, finally, “Nevertheless, flowers fall with attachment, while weeds grow with hatred.” That means flowers, weeds, anyway have their own karma. Cats or dogs or Buddha; trees, birds – all are Buddha, exactly. Which they can live in this world without evaluation and judgement. Whatever you say, that is human business; it doesn’t matter, they can live. But, cat is cat. Cat has his own karma. Dog is still his own karma. That’s why we can share our compassion with a dog, with a cat. 

The same applies to human beings. We can have, finally, human body and mind. Without this karma, we cannot practice. So, this is really karma, the human body – coming from parents. This is not biological understanding, this is a really deep understand. If you understand your body and mind just according to biology, physiological point of view, you really hate your body and mind. But, if you understand more deeply, your body and mind become Buddha. 

Human body and mind as Buddha is taking care of with compassion. In order to share your life with others. Because others also have same karma, so you can share. At that time, you can be really free from karma. Because you can take care of your karma without putting certain ideas, like or dislike or whatever it is – just take care, day by day, and share your karma with people, and recognize how important it is. That practice is wonderful, which is called your karma turns into Buddha. 

That is the conclusion of my talk this week. Do you have any questions?
