> 1. The Storehouse Consciousness
>
> The Mind as phenomena (samsara) is grounded on the Tathagata-garbha. What is called the
Storehouse Consciousness is that in which "neither birth nor death (nirvana)" diffuses
harmoniously with "birth and death (samsara)", and yet in which both are neither identical nor
different. This Consciousness has two aspects which embrace all states of existence and create
all states of existence. They are: (a) the aspect of enlightenment, and (b) the aspect of
nonenlightenment.

> (From *The Awakening of Faith*, translated by Yoshito S. Hakeda, 1967.)

There are [a few] terms, *tathagatagarbha*, or the storehouse consciousness. I have to make the meaning of those terms clear. 

*The Discourse on the Awakening of Mahayana Faith* begins with investigation of the *truth* first. This is a pretty peculiar characteristic of this discourse, which is different from other *shastra* discourse on *vijnanavada*, “mere consciousness.” *The Discourse on Mere Consciousness*, *Vijnanavada*, it begins with *alayavijnana* first. It begins with *alayavijnana*, but in this *Discourse on the Awakening of Mahayana Faith*, it begins with the truth. 

*Alayavijnana*, simply speaking, is [our] consciousness. So, *Vijnanavada* investigates what *our consciousness* is. So, analyzing, synthesizing. That is an interesting discourse. It is very difficult to believe in the truth, in terms of investigation of our consciousness, because our consciousness seems to be filled with delusions, so it’s very difficult to believe in the truth. If you get into the depth of the human world in terms of investigation of human consciousness, it’s very hard. 

So, but this discourse on Mahayana faith begins with truth. So, we step inside truth, investigation of the truth. That is a little bit different peculiarity from other books. 

So, there are several of the terms which we have learned. One is the *truth*. In this discourse, *truth* is called *the mind in terms of the truth*. So, general speaking, that is *truth*. So, let's [look at] the truth, that is number one. 

Second, I don't know how to translate it, this is *the ultimate nature of mind is pure and clean*. This is the second term. Second, *the ultimate nature of mind is pure*. This is one word. Particularly Prajnaparamita, the main teaching of Prajnaparamita always emphasizes this point. The ultimate nature of our human mind is pure and clean. 

Third, *tathagatagarbha*. 

And fourth, *alayavijnana*, *storehouse consciousness*. Look at page 37, in the note, there is the Sanskrit there. The storehouse consciousness [is] *alayavijnana*. This term appears in the *Discourse on Merely Consciousness* and also this book too. So, *alayavijnana*. 

And also the fifth, I want to say a little bit [about] *enlightenment* and *non-enlightenment*. 

Okay, let's make [the] meaning of those terms clear. 

First, *truth*. If you use the term *truth*, this is implication of a kind of the principle being which is omnipresent throughout the universe. That is the truth. In this [book], truth is called *the mind as truth*. Mind as truth. 

So, from this point, when you use the term *the truth*, it is that which it is of *unhumanization*. Do you understand? Unhumanization. It's a kind of abstract term, okay? Very abstract term, metaphysical term. Do you understand? So that's why *unhumanization*. That is a characteristic of this term, *truth*. 

But in this book it uses *the mind as truth*. So, in a sense, the truth is not used as the unhumanization. [It’s] a little bit connected with the human mind, that's why *the mind as truth*. But still, this is the same meaning as the usual term, the truth. So, if you use the term *mind as truth*, [it] gives you a certain hint, which the truth is, truth should be connected with the human consciousness, human world. That is the term *the mind as truth*. 

Next, the second term is *the ultimate nature of mind as truth [is] pure and clean*. Which occurs in various Mahayana scriptures. This is pretty [humanized], because when the truth is personalized, at that time this is called, truth is called, the ultimate nature of mind is pure and clean. Do you understand? Is that clear?

So, when the truth manifests itself as one's personality, it is called, the truth is, anyway, truth is working in the human life, and truth is called, *the ultimate nature of the mind is pure and clean*. So, since the truth is intrinsic nature of human mind, it can be acquired in terms of state of individual mind. If the truth is considered in terms of the individual mind state, the intrinsic nature of mind is seen as pure. Therefore, the term *the ultimate nature of mind is pure and clean* is used. It means that the intrinsic nature of mind is of the immutable nature of the truth. Immutable nature. 

So, in the second term, *the ultimate nature of mind is pure and clean*, the truth is expressed as a little bit mind, as mind, not truth, mind, because truth is connected with human mind. So, very naturally later, a certain Buddhist teaching develops in relation with wisdom and also principle. Principle and wisdom. 

So, when you use the term truth, it emphasizes a little bit strongly the principle side, the aspect of principle, the principle of being. But when you use the mind, it emphasizes a little bit strongly, the sphere or faith of wisdom. 

So, in this book, it is called the principle and wisdom are not different, but merging of the principle and wisdom. So, because the principle is operative in the function of wisdom, wisdom is the manifestation of principle. So, it is understood as the wisdom fit to the principle of being. 

So, in the later, there is another term, Buddha wisdom. Buddha wisdom. It's a Buddha wisdom, dharma body, *dharmakaya* of the Tathagata, and the Tathagata dharmakaya. These kind of terms develop, very naturally. 

Anyway, if you investigate the human mind, it's very difficult to see the wisdom in the human mind. It's very difficult to find the wisdom of the human mind because, in terms of everyday life, human mind is very cloudy. So, even though Buddhism emphasizes the center of the human mind is based on wisdom, it's very difficult to believe [it]. Much less [that] wisdom is working with the principle of being, or the principle of being contains with the function of the wisdom, it's very difficult to believe in such a mind. 

So, very naturally we have to research human mind from a little bit broad aspect, so-called the truth. We get into the human mind from the truth. 

So, we start to investigate the truth. In other words, panorama picture of the universe. Anyway, we start to investigate this, instead of small human mind. That is a little easier, that's why this book begins with the investigation of the truth. 

So, very naturally the term the truth comes up first in this book. And next, the second term, that is *the ultimate nature of the mind is pure and clean*. Because truth, the term it should be seen, should be understood, in deep and close connection with the human mind. So when the truth manifests itself in the realm of human mind, it is called *ultimate nature of mind is pure and clean*. 

Next, *tathagatagarbha*. Tathagata-garbha, *garbha* means the mother's womb, and also embryo. In this book it says, look at the page 13, in the introduction is the Tathagata-garbha, it says Tathagata-garbha or “matrix of Tathagata”. And it says,

> The word garbha,meaning a matrix, germ, or embryo, symbolizes the receptacle of Tathågata or the absolute.

That is the meaning of *garbha*. 

So the term *tathagatagarbha* is named in relation with human delusion. So it is that which the ultimate nature of mind is pure and clean *is* regarded as being covered with delusion. At that time, the ultimate nature of the mind is pure and clean is called *tathagatagarbha*. So, *the ultimate nature of mind is pure and clean* is already personalized, but still a little far, a little gap between human life, which is suffering from their life. So very naturally, we investigate the intrinsic pure nature of human mind, so-called *the ultimate nature of mind is pure and clean*. In terms of [the] human life we are [confronted] with. 

So that is, at that time, it is very difficult to say mind is completely pure. It’s very difficult. Because mind is pure but on the other hand mind is not pure! So very naturally you can see the other aspect, that is delusion or illusion. So very naturally, there is another term comes up, that is *tathagatagarbha*. 

So, the *tathagatagarbha* is the intrinsic pure nature of the human mind covered with illusion and delusion. At that time, the intrinsic pure nature of the mind is called *tathagatagarbha*. But it is not something like the sun covered with a cloud. It’s not something like that. 

But anyway, that’s why next *tathagatagarbha* comes up, and then in terms of *tathagatagarbha*, we may say that human being is based on the idea of embryo which exists in the mother's womb. So, who will be born, sooner or later. So that is, it is really easy to believe this situation. Very naturally the idea of *tathagatagarbha* developed. 

Next, but still [...] it is very difficult to know how *tathagatagarbha* works in our daily life. It’s very difficult. Only by the term *tathagatagarbha*, we can emotionally, according to human feelings, we can feel that, and we can believe that. But logically, it’s very difficult to know. So how? [How] to know how this *tathagatagarbha* works, and also how we can be free from illusions in this peculiar situation of *tathagatagarbha*. So that’s why next another term comes up, that is *alayavijnana*. 

So *alayavijnana* gives a certain hint to us how *tathagatagarbha* works in our life. A hint to let us know how it works. How we can be free from illusions, et cetera. Or how we can be free from *tathagatagarbha*. *Tathagatagarbha* is still a samsaric world. 

So that is *alayavijnana*. 

So alayavijnana, so even though you say *tathagatagarbha* is overall picture of human life, which has the buddha-nature and also human illusions, together. But it is not the doctrine of dualism. So *alayavijnana* tries to explain not the doctrine of dualism. It is because that peculiar situation of *alayavijnana* is that the pure nature of human consciousness which is called *unborn* or *imperishable*. Unborn, imperishable is whole picture of human consciousness. On the other hand, *illusion* is also the whole picture of human consciousness. It’s not a part of, not the covered. Illusion is not something by which something is covered. So illusion is the total picture of human life. On the other hand, pure nature of consciousness is also total picture of human life. Because *tathagatagarbha* is, just like I mention often, one piece of paper with two aspects, back and front. And also the one piece of paper is constantly operating, working, without stopping even for a moment. That is a panoramic picture of universe. The universe is one, truth is one. This one universe has two aspects, back and front, good and bad, right and wrong, et cetera. Dualistic world, but both are working as one. 

So, in the process of total functioning, total working, at that time you can see front in a moment. In that time, front occupies whole piece of paper. So front *is* one piece of paper. Front is not part of a piece of paper in relation to the back – that is already we, our consciousness, discriminating mind, thinking that way. But in the process of total working, there is nothing to stop it. So when you see the front, that’s it. There is no chance to think of back. So you have to fit into the front. Otherwise, you miss the train. You miss the train. Because time is moving, and also the working in human world is in the stream of time. So if you analyze, you miss the train. So if you see the front, that is the train you have to get on. Anyway, get on, anyway, right on. So the front is not the certain particular situation in relation to back. So, the front is total life. 

So that is the idea of *tathagatagarbha*. 

So *alayavijnana* tries to explain that kind of the *tathagatagarbha* we can believe in. So that logically we try to explain. So, if you say *alayavijnana*, regarded as *tathagatagarbha*, this term uses *vijñāna*. *Vijñāna* is a human consciousness. So very naturally, *alayavijnana* is the term which we try to pull closely the (tathagatagarbha) into our life, subjectively, and, or more, [awakening]. So, *alayavijnana* is the term pretty subjective and more awakening. Because there is a *vijñāna*, so *alayavijnana*. 

So very naturally, our consciousness, so-called *vijñāna*, regarded as *ālaya*, which is the foundation of human life, pre-foundation of human life. That foundation of human life is that which is covered with, that which the truth is covered with, kind of, delusion. That is the foundation of human consciousness. 

So very naturally, in terms of human consciousness, we can see *tathagatagarbha* in two ways. Our consciousness is originally pretty enlightened, originally enlightened, because the truth, nirvana, or tathagata. So originally, our human consciousness is [pretty enlightened]. On the other hand, our human consciousness is un-enlightened. Because enlightenment aspect of human consciousness is covered with delusions. But through your everyday life you can understand this. 

So through your everyday life, you cannot say human mind is very kind. You cannot say so. On the other hand, human consciousness is, human mind is pretty deluded, or pretty brutal and violent – you cannot say so either. But on the other hand, you cannot say either that human consciousness is brutal, cowardly, or unkind, you cannot say so. Pretty kind, not violent. So we can see them both. 

So if you see the mind is very kind and compassionate, that is, we don't know why, but we do always. So originally, mind is originally very enlightened. But on the other hand, mind is not enlightened. So very naturally, next term comes up, so-called the deep consciousness as... look at page 36, the second line from the bottom: 

> This Consciousness has two aspects which embrace all states of existence and create all states of existence. [They are: (a) the aspect of enlightenment, and (b) the aspect of nonenlightenment.]

Because this consciousness, *alayavijnana*, is completely foundation, the ground for our life. So on this ground, there are many beings [...], many beings exist simultaneously. On the other hand, it is not always passive. It's creating, constantly, all sentient beings. So on the ground, in the foundation of human life, there are all sentient beings. Simultaneously, all sentient beings are created, constantly. Produced. So that is the panoramic picture of the foundation of human consciousness, so-called *alayavijnana*. 

And then if you look at that foundation, very naturally, it is characterized by two aspects, that is *enlightenment* and *non-enlightenment*. Because in terms of enlightenment, mind is very kind, compassionate. Even though you don't know why you are compassionate or kind, you don't know, immediately you can do it, you can be kind. On the other hand, you don't know why you are brutal or unkind and violent, but you do, always. So very naturally, there are two kinds of things [that] come up, two kinds of characteristic of foundation of human life. 

So, the enlightenment and non-enlightenment are merged together. So very naturally, if you see one aspect of the mind, so-called not-enlightenment – in other words, you are very violent. You are very violent, if you look at yourself, how brutal you are, how unkind you are, at that time it is a negative understanding of human life. But there is, within the negative expression of human life, there is a positive aspect of human life is always working, by which negative expression of life comes into existence. In other words, if I say, “I am bad boy,” simultaneously within that negative expression, so-called bad boy, simultaneously good boy [is] working within the bad boy. In other words, bad boy contains good boy. 

So, that's why if you look at very strongly, seriously and very deeply how brutal we are, we cannot be brutal. So very naturally, you can turn over the leaf of your life. Do you understand? You can turn over. So, very naturally you want to do something not brutal. And also if you say “good boy,”simultaneously good boy, contains not-good boy. 

So, always both exist. So, whatever situation, your situation basically is always free. Going to *any* place, any direction – good boy or bad boy. You are always neutral. Neutral means you are *unstained*. In other words, *one mind*. One piece of paper. 

When you see the back, it's just the back. Next moment, you can see the front; it's front. But if you see the front, you say, “That's it.” I don't think so, because there is a back. But on the other hand, intellectually you can see so, but all you have to do is just accept the good boy if you see the front, totally. So, very naturally, you are located at intersection of being, intersection of time and space. That means just [a dot]. And you can go any place. Any place.

So, if you see unenlightened aspect of human life, through and through and deeply from the bottom of your heart, at time it is called *acquired awakening*. So-called *bodhi mind*. The way-seeking mind. Because un-enlightenment, not-enlightenment, contains enlightenment. 

So that’s why, if you really deeply taste the unenlightened aspect of human life, that is the first step to get into the enlightened aspect of the world, so-called *bodhi-mind*. In the technical term, in the next section, it is called *essence of mind*, but I don't know if *essence of mind* is the right translation. According to Prof. Abe, he translated *acquired enlightenment*. And the other term, in relation to *acquired enlightenment*, is *original enlightenment*. Well, next time I would like to explain this, the *original enlightenment* and *acquired enlightenment*.

So, today, anyway, we have understood the characteristic of *alayavijnana*, which has two characteristics, enlightened aspect and non-enlightened aspect. That is *alayavijnana*. So, from this point, we are living at the intersection of enlightenment and non-enlightenment. 

So, if you see enlightenment very deeply, you will be an enlightened person. And on the other hand, if you see deeply unenlightened aspect of human life, it is also implication of bodhi-mind. Implication of stepping inside, stepping inside to, anyway, the nirvana or enlightened world. That’s why bodhi-mind is important for us, awakening is important for us. 

So, that is all I have to say today. So, *alayavijnana* is the term [or] expression of tathagatagarbha which is more subjective and more awakening. So, closely relation with actual human life, how *tathagatagarbha* works. At that time, we have to research what *tathagatagarbha* is. At that time, tathagatagarbha is ... 

*[Tape break.]*

... enlightened aspect or non-enlightened aspect. 

Then, you should read these sections. 

> The Mind as phenomena (samsara) is grounded on the Tathagata-garbha.

Then very naturally you understand that one. Okay? The mind as phenomena, samsara, samsaric world – if the mind as samsaric world is [pulled] to individual personal life. At that time, what you can see? What you can see, in your mind? 

You can see only the pure, something pure? Or you can see something stained? Or you can see both? You are a bad boy? Yes... but no. You are a good boy? You can say yes, or no. So, very naturally, the mind as phenomena, if you see the mind in terms of phenomena, samsaric world, it is kind of a combination of “good boy” and “bad boy”. Not combination, but I use the [word] combination now. But this is called *tathagatagarbha*. So, the mind as phenomena is grounded on the *tathagatagarbha*. So, this mind is [...] the fundamental aspect of human life. 

Next, 

> What is called the Storehouse Consciousness is that in which "neither birth nor death (nirvana)" diffuses
harmoniously with "birth and death (samsara)", [and yet in which both are neither
identical nor different].

What do you understand this [means]? “Diffuses harmony”? Do you understand that one? “Diffuses harmony with.” That is come together or separate, scattered? What [does it] mean? “Diffuses harmoniously with.” 

**Someone:** *[Unintelligible.]* 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Beg your pardon?

**Same person:** Neither. *[Laughter.]*

**Katagiri Roshi:** Oh, neither. 

So, “diffuses harmoniously with” means? 

**Same person:** Neither scattering nor separate. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Oh, I see. 

**Same person:** Very different, [according to] this. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** I see. Is that the definition? 

**Someone:** I thought it was [...] interpenetrating... boundless, diffuse. 

Yes. You can see. 

There are boundaries, the boundaries that makes them separate, diffuse. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Separate, scattered. Not scattered. 

**Same person:** Well, the boundary is taken away, then they merge. 

**Someone else:** Right. 

**Someone:** I think it is more just that idea that the absolute order is diffuse, like broken down, separated out into phenomena. But it has more that idea of diffusion.

**Katagiri Roshi:** Diffusion? Okay. So, and [then] harmoniously means? 

**Same person:** Harmoniously means [there’s no difference]. [There’s an] integration. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** So, in terms of, in my understanding, “diffuses harmoniously with” means a kind of to diffuse something without any problems. Just diffuse. That's what you mean? Or diffusing and also coming together? That's what you mean? 

**Someone:** Just the [...]. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Just the diffuse. Separating. 

**Same person:** Yes. Well, no. Just the... 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Merging them. 

**Same person:** Yes. So, you don't see either. Anything. 

**Someone:** If a gas diffuses, it spreads out and still is in that space, but in the harmonious way, there can be more than one, they don't conflict. They’re not separate. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Oh I see. I see. 

So, if so, neither birth nor death, simply speaking, is truth or absolute or pure nature [...] consciousness. Beyond human speculation. 

The truth diffuses harmoniously with samsaric world. Do you understand that, if I say so like this?

**Someone:** The truth with [samsara] diffuses is like they become one. Just come exactly together. So, one truth diffuses harmoniously with samsaric means, like there's dark here in the room, and then there's a light coming in. So light and darkness together. So, neither one is perceivable. 

**Someone:** I prefer focusing more on fusion, rather than the concept of truth. 

*[unintelligible]*

**Someone:** Well, diffusion and fusion are just the two sides of the same thing. 

**Someone:** But there's a second half that says, "And yet in which both are neither identical nor different." That's the second half of the statement. 

**Someone:** Right. It's like everybody has a different understanding of ink and water. If you diffuse them, they’re still ink and water. But they're together. It's not like there's ink and water separate. They're together. But they're still different. That's what I say. It's like the light is the opposite. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yeah. That's what you mean, huh?

**Someone:** Well, that’s what I think it means.

**Katagiri Roshi:** That's what you mean too? 

**Someone:** Yes. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** So, pretty good... diffuses harmoniously... I have never thought of that one. 

**Someone:** Roshi, I still have a quesrtion, "And yet in which both are neither identical nor different." 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yeah, because you cannot say water and milk is not identical. But even though milk would get into water's life, it's not identical because milk and water there. But on the other hand, if you put the milk into the water, it's not different. That is called harmony. Harmony. 

So that's why next it says "In which both are neither identical nor different." Is that alright? Okay?

**Someone:** Is that what the merging of unity and difference is all about? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Huh? 

**Same person:**Isn't the *Sandokai* saying that? 

Yes, merging the difference and the unity, that is exactly same as difference. But in the *Sandokai*, it emphasizes strongly that just fusing aspect, unity, the aspect of the unity. Okay? 

But this discourse always mentions the panoramic picture of fusing and diffuse. Fuse and diffuse, fuse and diffuse – like this. Comes together, separates, comes together, separates. It's one, but it's not one, two. Something like that. Delusion seems to be separate from the pure nature, but it's not separate. It’s contained within pure nature. Just like the [someone] said, you know, gas is separate, the gas is expanded all over. But it's not disappeared, it's still there. 

Alright. That is so-called *tathagatagarbha*, the meaning of *tathagatagarbha*. And the storehouse consciousness, which is the foundation of all mind, of all life. That is called *storehouse consciousness*, *alayavijnana*.

So it's not the dualistic. Is that alright? Do you understand? It is not the doctrine of the dualistic. Dualistic is clearly to separate something. A never be B, you know. A never accept B. A is not B, constantly. Alright?

**Someone:** The problem with the analogy to either milk and water, or ink and water, or gas and air, it seems they seem to be saying though, that if you break down any of those, like milk and water, far enough you'll find one thing that's milk and one thing that's water. But this seems to be saying that no matter how far you break it down, you'll never find just one molecule of milk and one molecule of gas. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Well, intellectually, you can see it. Intellectually. If your discriminating mind begins to know, very naturally, the molecule is there, et cetera. But that is the intellectual understanding, discriminating world. But our life is always something more than intellectual function. 

So, anyway, you should, you must be more active, and you should be right on the train. When you see the train, you shouldn’t miss the train. But the train is always going; you’re just right on. So that is more active. You have to be constantly one with the stream of time, just like being on a jet airplane, you have to be always there. And then you can be in the stream of time, simultaneously you can create time. You can do something there.

So that is the relationship between the water and milk. But if you start to investigate intellectually, you can say anything. All right? Is that what you mean?

**Someone:** I'm not sure. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** You're not? So what is the point you're saying? 

**Same person:** I was trying to say that if you're right on the train, at any one moment, you can't say whether it's either milk or water. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Sure. You cannot say. 

**Same person:** But if you use the analogy of milk and water, it seems to say that you can, you can get down and look at it close enough and find water there and milk there, it’s just that they're mixed up.

**Katagiri Roshi:** Right. That's true. 

But in the section next, it says, "This consciousness has two aspects which embrace all states of existence and create all states of existence. They are, the one, the first, the aspect of enlightenment, and the two, the aspect of non-enlightenment." That's why this is a little bit different from what you mentioned, okay? If you're right on, you don't know what's going on there. Well, it doesn't mean you don't know. There is no space to poke your head into, so you just be there. But in this case, a little bit we are investigating how *tathagatagarbha* works. That's why it's [...] intellectual here. [...] That's why it has the foundation of your life in two aspects working together, in the stream of process. In the stream of process we have to be right on constantly. But that is practically speaking, that is practical aspect of your life. But on the other hand, we have to research, we want to know, well, how it works. That's why this book starts to analyze. 

Because human beings, we always judge ourselves as “bad”. If you see yourself bad, that's it. But that is not the right understanding. Because if you always judge yourself bad, then there is no chance to grow in the future. So very naturally we have to understand what's the foundation? What is the foundation of your life? What's characteristic of your foundation? What kind of structure is there? That is really two things always diffusing harmoniously with each other. That's why if you see bad aspect of human life is contained [within] good [aspect]. 

Do you have another question? 

Okay. So next, “A”, page 37, "The Aspect of Enlightenment".

**Someone:** Hojo-san?

**Katagiri Roshi:** Hai.

**Same person:** *[Unintelligible]* and he's doing this, you know, and why that term is used to express the ... the foundation of existence in the phenomenal world. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Well, that is tradition, and in the development of Buddhist teachings. Before this book was published, there was another teaching so-called *Vijñānavāda*, the *discourse on the merely consciousness*. That discourse on merely consciousness uses this term, *alayavijnana*, as a foundation of human consciousness. That is [the] eighth consciousness we call *alayavijnana*. That's why this discourse that uses that term. 

But *alaya* means a kind of holy. So holy consciousness. But holy consciousness doesn't mean it's always holy. *[He chuckles.]* 

**Someone:** How is it translated "holy" into "storehouse"? You’ve been using the word storehouse.

**Someone:** Isn't there a sort of [...] idea of an embryo or potential. The potential for both?

**Katagiri Roshi:** Because the holiness contains the something, always. Contains the something, in terms of *Vijñānavāda*, *shuji* means "seed". [...] 

**Someone:** The seeds are in the storehouse? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** In the storehouse, always. That's the consciousness storehouse, storehouse consciousness. So we have lots of things. 

**Someone:** And that would be seeds for enlightenment and also for... 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Sure. Yes. Many seeds. 

**Someone:** And then the whole concept of *alayavijnana*, [...] we talked about [...] how that is different from the absolute one? Or truth?

**Katagiri Roshi:** Truth. Truth is more the abstract, the metaphysical term. 

**Someone:** Okay, so this term... 

**Katagiri Roshi:** That term should closely connect with the person's individual life. 

**Someone:** So like how we fit into...

**Katagiri Roshi:** Yes. At that time, it is called the "in terms of pure nature of the mind," et cetera. Or according to this, “the mind in terms of truth.” Something like that. 

And also it must be more closely subjective and awakening. At that time it is called *alayavijnana*. "Vijnana" means consciousness. "Alaya" consciousness. Storehouse consciousness. 

**Someone:** So by connecting that to ourself, it’s subjective, that gives people more hope. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Hope? Yes. The concept of "alayavijnana" gives some more hope, more deep understanding of the structure of foundation, human foundation of being. 

In other words, they should be free, anyway. Free from any particular idea – "bad boy" or "good boy." Alright?
