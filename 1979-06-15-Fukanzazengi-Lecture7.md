... when the Buddha Shakyamuni sat in meditation, in zazen, under a tree, [*sound of thunder*] he had tremendous sound of thunder, that was more than this. But, his meditation, zazen, was not disturbed by the thunder. And after zazen, he stood from his seat, and practiced kinhin, walking meditation. At that time, thunder was completely gone. The surroundings were very quiet. Around him, there was one of the Buddhist laymen, who watched the Buddha's meditation. But the Buddha's zazen [*sound of thunder*] was never disturbed by thunder. [*loud sound of thunder continues*] But (it) was really tremendous sound of thunder. He asked the Buddha, "Four cows and two farmers were killed by electric shock of lightning at this time, a few minutes ago." [*long sound of thunder, or airplane low overhead*] (   ) you hear the sound of thunder. [*sound continues*] The layman said, "There was a huge sound of thunder, everyone knew that. Did you sleep at that time?" Buddha said, "No, I didn't sleep." So the layman said, "Were you in the state of person who (is) without consciousness?" The Buddha said, "No. I did zazen, with consciousness." So layman said, "That's (  ) wonderful. I have never heard before." So the layman really respected [*thunder*] the Buddha Shakyamuni's zazen. 

In those days, the attainment of samadhi with no consciousness, was regarded as the highest level of spiritual life. In this point, you can stop breath for a certain period of time; or you can stay in a sort of death. You can stop functioning of your heart. 

(5:06) So that was really highest level of practice in those days. Practice (informed?) by Brahmanism. So, if the people attained this, they believed it's (perfect?). But Buddha didn't do (this); Buddha did zazen with consciousness. Never-the-less, he didn't hear the sound. His zazen was not disturbed by the sound of meditation, the sound of the thunder. So, this layman had never heard before about such a kind of zazen. So he said, "How wonderful (   ) it is." 

Dogen commented (on) this story with deepest respect, in the collection of Dogen's short preaching (Eihei Koroku; Dharma Hall Discourse #372). Dogen Zenji says, "The Buddha enters samadhi with consciousness, and the thirty-four ways to sever delusions manifest themselves within it. The Buddha uses this from morning to night, and illuminates the quest of his body in the zendo." 

"The Buddha enters samadhi with consciousness," - that is, exactly Buddha Shakyamuni did zazen with consciousness. Samadhi means oneness with subject and zazen. And when the practicer and zazen become one, that is samadhi. So, "the Buddha enters samadhi with consciousness." 

"The thirty-four ways to sever delusions manifested themselves within it." In those days, there were 34 techniques to sever the delusions and how to attain enlightenment, how to enter nirvana. In those days, 34 ways, considered to cut off delusions and enter nirvana. But if the Buddha did zazen with consciousness, at that time, within it, the 34 ways to sever delusion and enter nirvana manifest themselves. That is Dogen's understanding. That's why (the) layman also said, "How excellent it is." [*thunder*] 

(9:14) Also, Dogen Zenji, said, in Bendowa, he said, "Moreover, although in realization the mind of the zazen practicer and its object both arise and disappear within the stillness of samadhi. Since it occurs within the sphere of jijuyu, it doesn't disturb a single mote of dust, nor infringe upon a single phenomenon." "Although in realization, the mind of the zazen practicer and also its object both arise and disappear" - that means, the mind and its objects, goes in, and goes out; enlightenment - "within the stillness of samadhi." "Within the stillness of samadhi" - that is, we have a technical term, shijo, signing of the beginning of zazen. (See entry in [Japanese-English
Glossary of Zen Terms](https://terebess.hu/zen/szoto/szotar/szotar.html)) When you hit the bell three times, that is called shijo, signing of beginning of zazen. That is, the "shi" is "struck". "Jo" is "stillness". Stillness implies samadhi. Stillness implies zazen itself. So, "struck zazen" means, zazen settles itself in zazen. So you dwell in zazen at that time. That is, sign of starting of zazen. So we call, "shijo". End of zazen is called "kaijo"; "kai" means open. "Jo" is stillness. So, "open stillness."  The stillness means zazen. "To open zazen". That means, end of zazen. 

(12:10) So in this case, the same applied to this, "within the stillness of samadhi," within zazen itself. "... the mind and its objects" - the mind and also zazen. Mind and zazen both, goes in, goes out; enlightenment, and realization. Well, I told you yesterday, so far. If you do really real zazen - not before zazen, not after zazen - regardless of whether you are conscious of it or not, you are right there. You are right in the middle of zazen. No delusions, no confusions. But consciousness is very picky. So immediately, you can pick up before zazen, after zazen. But if you stop the functioning of your mind, you can be there constantly. But always, consciously, mind is picky. Even though you are right in the middle of zazen, you say, "Ah - I attain enlightenment." And then immediately, you sleep. [*someone chuckles*] And then you wake up; the moment when you wake up, you say, "Oh - I attain enlightenment." I don't think so. [*laughs*] I don't think so. You sleep pretty well, in zazen. [*laughter*] And then, something happens and you wake up. [*thunder*] At that time, you don't realize whether you were sleeping, or you were entering samadhi. You don't. So that's why sometimes you misunderstood. "Oh, I attained enlightenment." But it's not actually. [*laughter*] 

So sometimes, right in the middle of zazen, still you can go in enlightenment, or go out of enlightenment. But whatever you do - goes in, goes out - all are going on right in the middle of zazen. So, Dogen Zenji says, "Mind and its object both goes in, goes out, enlightenment within zazen itself, the stillness of samadhi. Since it occurs without the sphere of jijuyu, it doesn't disturb a single mote of dust, nor infringe upon a single phenomenon." "It doesn't disturb a single mote of dust," that means object. If you do zazen, zazen becomes object. But, it doesn't - your zazen, you don't disturb your object. Without moving even an inch, to the left, or front, and backward, anyway, you can completely become one with zazen itself. At that time, using your body, your breath, and your mind - in other words, by the regulation of your body, and breath, and mind - if this practice is exactly perfect, your whole body is exactly fitting into zazen, your object. So, at that time, your body and mind disappear. Where? Within zazen. So, it's not necessary to remove zazen from one A place, to B place, or forward and backward, or up and down. Nothing; just there. And all you have to do is, making arrangement, your body, breath and mind, and just fit into it. At that time, without moving, without disturbing even a single mote of dust, you can be one with. You can be right in the middle of samadhi. That is call samadhi, okay?

(17:36) And also, "nor infringe upon a single phenomenon." That means, when your body and mind [*thunder*] and breath are used perfectly, in the proper way, fitting into your zazen - at that time, it's not necessary to move to the left or the right, up, and back, and down, and forward and backward. Just there, and just fit there. At that time, you can become one with zazen. And then that zazen completely returns to you. Because, you are one with zazen. So, no body and mind. Zazen, just there. 

So zazen is you, you are zazen. At that time, I told you - I think on the second day of sesshin, or the first day, I forgot. Anyway - total personality blooms. Total personality blooms there. In other words, original nature of the self blooms, very naturally. Because, there is no mind which is picky. Mind is there, but mind doesn't work. Just mind, is existent with your zazen, and your body. So, that's why "nor infringe upon a single phenomena" means, your original nature of the body and mind, blooms. Without destroying your  nose, or your ears, your eyes, your consciousness. Without doing anything. For this, just blooms. 

(19:50) And then, jijuyu: "since it occurs within the sphere of jijuyu" means, when you do zazen in that way, your body and mind become one with zazen. And then, zazen and all circumstances return to you. All circumstances exist simultaneously in peace and harmony. Sound of the car, sound of thunder, exist. But your mind is here. But all circumstances, zazen and all circumstances, return to you. That means, we do zazen, everything exists, in peace and harmony. Japan, United States, sound of car, sound of the cat, sound of the raindrops, lightning... whatever happens, all exist in peace, right in the middle of zazen. At that time it is called jijuyu: samadhi of jijuyu. "Ji" is self. The "ju" of jijuyu means "receive". "Yu" is "to function; to work". Or, to take advantage of. So, of itself, if you do zazen like this, you can receive freedom. Very naturally, of itself. And, you can use it. 

(22:02) So, that's why Dogen Zenji says, "although in realization the mind and its object both arise and disappear within the stillness of samadhi, since it occurs within the sphere of jijuyu, it doesn't disturb a single mote of dust, nor infringe upon a single phenomenon." So from this point, what the Buddha said, not to hear the sound of the thunder doesn't mean that he was in a state of no consciousness. He did zazen with consciousness. If you do zazen with no consciousness, hitting the bell, chanting the sutras - it doesn't make sense, it's useless. Shijo, the sign of the beginning of zazen, or the sign of the end of zazen - it's ridiculous; it doesn't make sense. Why do you have to hit the bell, if the main purpose of zazen is to reach the no consciousness? It's not necessary to hit the bell, because even though you hit the bell, you cannot hear it. It's not necessary to eat your breakfast, and lunch, and dinner, because you can stop your heart for a period of time, for seven days. You can do it; maybe so. [*next sentence is delivered rapidly; not sure he actually says it*] And you can die. I read the article (about) one of the saints in India. He was in a casket for almost more than seven days. And the scientists checked his heart; his heart was completely stopped. And after that he came out, but he was alive. So it's *possible*; it's possible. But the zazen we do is not something like this. We have zazen with consciousness. 

(25:10) And also, Dogen Zenji says, "the Buddha uses this from morning to night." Morning to night. Not only zazen; not only in the time of doing zazen. But also, from the morning to night, your mind must be attentive to all movement of behavior. Working in the kitchen, and working on the hallways, working in the zendo, picking the plant and grasses outside, washing something; whatever you do, your mind must be *there*, present with each movement.

Zazen is always working in your daily living from the morning to night. But it doesn't mean you should be nervous, because you have to pay careful attention to your mind. Checking whether your mind is always attentive to each movement: if you do that, you will be nervous. I don't mean that. Because you cannot stop, you cannot disturb, even a single mote of dust. In other words, you cannot stop a stream of time. You must be always right in the middle of the stream of time. Never-the-less, there is mind, present with activity. 

That's why Dogen Zenji says, "the Buddha uses this from [*thunder*] morning to night. And culminates the quest of his body in the zendo." "Culminates the quest of his body" means, mind completely fit. ( ) In other words, I always use, "your kind compassionate attention, penetrate from the top of your head, to the tip of your toes." That means, when you stand up, you have to stand up with what? Two feet. Of course, two feet. You can hold back; you can stand up with two hands. But usually you have to stand up with two feet. But it is not real practice of Zen. You have to stand up with two feet, two hands, and also your nose, your eyes, your mouth, your heart, your emotions, your all circumstances. At that time, you can really culminate the quest of your body. And then you say, "Oh. This is stand up, perfectly." You feel good at that time. 

(28:56) Or, I always tell you, if you play the guitar, you can play the guitar with two hands, of course. But it is not perfect way of playing guitar, with two hands. You have to play the guitar with two hands, two feet. You have to play the guitar with two feet. How you can play? I don't know. [chuckles] But you can play, you can play. Two feet, and with your nose, with your mouth, with your eyes, with your knowledge, with your perceptions, with your consciousness, with your heart, with your emotions, with your past life, with your present life, with your future life, and the composer's, and all circumstances. Then at that time, that is perfect practice of playing guitar.

And then, that is what is called "to culminate the quest of your body". And then, in the playing guitar, in the daily living: at that time, you really feel good, from playing guitar from your body, from your mind. So that's why you cannot stop, finally, playing guitar. Something compels you to continue to practice. Even though consciously you don't want, something compels you. 

So that's why finally, you will be a great guitar player. Even though you don't like it. Even though you don't expect. Finally, you will be a great guitar player.

That's why Dogen Zenji says, "Buddha uses this from morning to night and culminates the quest of his body in the zendo." 

***Question***: Culminates?

***Katagiri***: Culminate. Is that okay? C-u-l-m-i-n-a-t-e. Culminates. (Transcriber comment: This is helpful. I wasn't completely sure it was "culminates," either.)

(31:33) That's why in Fukanzazengi, "zazen must be deportment beyond man's hearing and seeing." But of course it is hearing and seeing, because you cannot move even a single mote of dust, nor infringe upon a single phenomenon. Finally, you can manifest beautiful flower of the total personality, right in the middle of zazen. So, at that time, "Is it not a principle that is prior to his knowledge and perceptions?" And you have to use knowledge and perceptions - not no-mind. "No mind" means, through and through, you have to use mind. 

So, that is practice of regulation of your body, breath, and mind. We should know the mind is very picky. Monkey mind. That's why we need the practice of regulating the mind. But we have to use the mind. When you regulate your body and breath, there must be the mind, with your body, your breath. Otherwise, you become careless, and die. 

Cat and dog and bird can do with their bodies, but no mind. But we are human beings. So first, we have to do something with your body, but there must be mind, constantly. Finally,  final goal of the practice (of) regulating the mind is to be free from mind, because mind is picky. That's why Dogen Zenji says, we have to practice samadhi. Complete samadhi, becoming one; using your whole body and mind, in order to fit your object perfectly. Adjusting, regulating your body, and breath, and mind. And then, everything is perfect at that time. Very naturally, your body fits to your object. And then, something happens. Something happens. We don't know what it is. And then when we see it, when your mind (is) immediately there and picking that, then we say, "Oh, that's zazen." But before your mind picks up, that zazen is no name. Just something happens. 

So, very naturally, zazen blooms. And also, you bloom, as total personality there. Yesterday I told you, between the two objects, there is a kind of forces. That is just a condition; condition or fact. That condition, conditioned elements, a kind of force to unify two objects, perfectly. That conditioned elements is kind of force which melds each object, used perfectly, in order to fit another object. That is conditioned element. Even though you don't like. If you don't like, and you try to escape a certain situation. Or if you do something at random, immediately some problem there. But basically, if there are two objects completely unified, basically. By what? Conditioned elements. But this conditioned element, we don't know what it is, because this is just dynamic working - that's all. Dynamic working. We don't know how two objects are fit together; we don't know. But anyway, conditioned elements can use one subject, exactly perfectly, in order to fit its own object. At that time, something happens. Striking the toe, and blood comes. 

Then immediately mind picks, and says, "Oh, toes. And rocks. And also blood." Finally you say, "Ouch." But that is just seeing the pictures, before and after. But right in the middle, between before and after, nothing. No pains, no delusions, no confusion. Just the rock, just the toes, just the breath. All of them exist perfectly, in peace.

So, we have to do this. How we can do this? From this body and mind. That's why, using your mind, consciousness. Let's use your body and mind with your best, in order to fit your object. Because, we have our body, and our mind, have lots of customs you have accumulated, from the beginning-less past. That's why its pretty hard to fit your object exactly. That's why we need to practice. But even for a moment, your body and mind are used perfectly to fit your object. That is, anyway, blooming flower, beautiful flower. Even though you don't know, it's really blooming flower. 

At that time, if you continue to do this, you become, very naturally, a great guitar player. Zazen player. Buddha-land player. It's true. Very naturally. Even though you don't like. Very naturally you do. 

That is called zazen, based on body and mind dropping off. 

Okay, do you have any questions?  

(39:44) ***Question***: Roshi? Earlier on, you told us the story of the monk who asked the master, "Do you hear the raindrops?" And he said, "I almost hear the raindrops" (   )  and you just mentioned that buddha said he (didn't) hear the thunder. Are they saying the same thing as (   )?

***Katagiri***: Same. Expression is different, but same situation. 

The Zen master (is) always right in the middle of real rain drops. But, it's not necessary to stay with it. That's why any time, anywhere, you can go to the right, to the left. That's why he said, "almost". Because if you say "I am to the left; I am just here" - immediately (  ) another aspect (  ) "Why don't you come this way?" So, "Okay, I will go." If you stay there, and then pop in, "I am here." Another side, "Why don't you come in?" That is dualistic. [*thunder*]

Basically, Zen Master, right in the middle of real raindrops, he never moves. But even if he moves: flickering lights. Right side, left side. And then, in the realm of flickering lights: "I am in the right side" or "I am in the left side." That is "almost". It's not real place he has to stay. But anytime he can move. That is freedom. 

Monk asked the ino - ino hit the (  ) [*unintelligible over airplane noise*]  

... Made by wood. We hit with small piece of wood. Then, hitting that one, and making announcement, which is very important. If he wants to kick out somebody, because he did something wrong, the Ino makes announcement, he will kick out of the zendo today, right after breakfast. And then, he bows nine bows to Manjushri and leaves. Well, that is, lots of rules. Lots of rules there. But anyway, in the story, Ino hits that one, and making announcement, today the monks on the right side should work such and such, outside, picking of grasses, et cetera. The monks on the left side should work such and such. And then monks accept. But only the head monk didn't accept. So he asked the Ino, "What does Manjushri do? Because he sits right in the middle of zendo." In the zendo, in Japan, Manjushri is enshrined in the middle of the zendo - not this way, right in the middle. The monks sit around Manjushri; right side, left side, anywhere around. 

So always Majushri sits in the middle. Well, the Ino didn't give assignment [*laughs*] to Manjushri; that's why head monk asked, "What does Manjushri do?" The Ino said, "He is always sitting in the middle, never attached to right or left. But he's working, always." Pretty good, huh? [some laughter]

That's why that is, Buddha said. So he didn't listen to, he didn't hear, the sound of thunder. (   ) But on the other hand, Buddha says, "I almost lose myself by the sound of thunder." That's (okay?). Because he is in the middle. Any time, anywhere, he can go in all directions. If your are always right side, it's pretty hard to go to the left side. But in the middle, it's pretty easy to go in all directions. 

***Question***: Is that what we mean by the Middle Way?

***Katagiri***: Yes. Middle Way. Middle Way is not to walk in the middle of the street, okay? [*pause, then laughter*] Middle Way is to walk in the middle with total awareness - of middle, right side, and left side, and all beings around him. This is the Middle Way.

But if you just walk in the middle, you hit your forehead against a streetcar. [*laughter*] Watch out. You cannot walk that way. 

Before, I told you always (   ). Why don't point out the middle. You can't just point out the middle without understanding there is a right, there is a left, or total picture of the (  ) 

[tape change]

(47:30) ... If you think about zazen for seven days, you become a good friend with zazen. How do you like? You hate. [*laughs*] 

Is there anyone who attained enlightenment? [*laughter*]

No one? [*laughter*]

(The following anecdote is difficult to transcribe, since it's mostly covered by laughter.)

Nakagawa Roshi(?) said, in the last day of sesshin, he would say - He is very interesting Zen master. He is very dramatic, and sometimes he is very mysterious, and sometimes he'd behave very strangely. But that is (  ). That's okay; beautiful, anyway. So one day he sat in the (   ) and did (sitting?), and he played a record of a Bach... concerto. Famous music, anyway. He liked very much; so he played that, and [*laughs*] he immediately said: "At this time during sesshin, there is one person who attained enlightenment. Do you know who it is?" [*laughter*] ... in a very big voice: "DO YOU KNOW WHO IT IS?" [*laughter*] And then no one said. [*laughter*] And then he said, "Do you want to know who who you [*unintelligble*]" [*laughter*] But no one said. And only one person said [*unknown gesture*]. Then he immediately said, "*This* person?" [*sound of dropping stick or something, disapprovingly*] ... That's interesting. Everybody such as (  ). Maybe I? He says, "No, no, no. I don't either." He's a nice guy, eh? Finally, all (  ) gone. "Yes." 

[laughs] Remember that story. That's real, true story.
