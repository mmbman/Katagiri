**Katagiri Roshi:** ... the first Ching is exactly C-h-i-n-g, and the C-h-apostrophe-i-n-g. *(He pronounces Ching Ch’ing, in response to a question.)* “Ching Ch’ings Sound of Raindrops.” 

The Pointer: 

> With a single stroke he completes it and passes beyond ordinary and holy. His slightest word can break things up, untying what is bound and releasing what is stuck. As if walking on thin ice or running over sword blades, he sits within the heaps of sound and form, he walks on top of sound and form.
>  
> For the moment I leave aside wondrous functioning in all directions. How is it when he leaves that very instant? To test I am citing this old case: look!

The Case:

> Ching Ch’ing asked a monk, “What sound is that outside the gate?” The monk said, “The sound of raindrops.”  
> Ch’ing said, “Sentient beings are inverted. They lose themselves and follow after things.”  
> The monk said, “What about you, Teacher?”  
> Ch’ing said, “I almost don’t lose myself.”  
> The monk said, “What is the meaning of ‘I almost don’t lose myself’?”  
> Ch’ing said, “Though it still should be easy to express oneself, to say the whole thing has to be difficult.”

(Returning to) the pointer:

> With a single stroke he completes it and passes beyond ordinary and holy. 

This discussion between Ching Ch’ings and the monk about the sound of raindrops. I think in the history of Buddhism... first, I think Buddha in the early period of time, when Buddhism was born, almost right after the Buddha’s death, the image of the Buddha was expressed by a kind of story. You know Jataka stories? It’s very fantastic, Jataka stories: it teaches us the Buddha’s past life (lives), in order to respect how great Buddha’s personality, Buddha’s life, was. In order to admire Buddha’s life, people naturally tried to explain the Buddha through his past like. That is the Jataka stories, the Jataka sutra. 

And with more development of Buddhism, the image of Buddha was represented as not a story, [but] as mountains, rivers, and birds... the sound of raindrops... Spring, butterflies, birds, et cetera. So in the Buddhist scriptures, particularly Zen, I think Zen teachers use the trees, birds, and mountains, skies, and moon, nature, to express buddha nature, and Buddha himself. Or enlightenment, et cetera. Truth. 

And later, in the later period of time, maybe the image of Buddha is represeted as a Buddha statue, picture of buddha, photograph of Buddha, et cetera. So, pretty different expression in the history of Buddhist teaching. 

So about the sound of raindrops... in this case, raindrops is not the usual raindrops, this is the symbol of buddha nature, the symbol of the truth. In order to express, in order to represt the truth, or buddha nature, or Buddha’s personality, the Zen teacher used the sound of the raindrops. 

So the sound of raindrops is not the usual sound of raindrops. Through the usual sound of raindrops you have to have eyes to see deeply what the truth is, through the raindrops. Through the table, through the flowers. That is the point in this case. 

“With a single stroke he completes it and passes beyond ordinary and holy” – I told you, through the table, through the sound of the raindrops, through the flowers, through the sound of a stone hitting the bamboo tree. Or blooming flowers. You can turn... you are all of a sudden impressed by the flower of the plum tree, the sound of the stone hitting the bamboo. This is religious transformation. You cannot know how you can turn your new leaf. You don’t know how you can turn ... 360 degrees of your life. That is not something which occurs through your intellectual understanding. Because between the phenomenal world and between your life and the truth, vastness of existence, there is no gap between. No gap. It’s exactly one... but it’s not “mixed up.” But when you try to understand the relationship between your life and the truth or vastness of existence, universal life, at that time you naturally create a gap between. And then you are interested in the gap. How can you fill up, how can you stop up that gap? In other words, how truth relates or influences your life. Or you are interested in the point how your life connects or touches the truth, vastness of existence or universal life. You’re very interested. But we don’t know. Because actually, no gap. 

When they have no gap between, it means they are functioning totally, at superspeed. They are not dead, they are not stagnant water. They are really functioning at superspeed, that’s why no gap between. 

I told you before, lots of colors on the top. And when the top is spinning, all colors become one. But all colors are not mixed up. They are one, but they are not one, each color is completely independent. But only when top is spinning, all colors become one. They are not one, they are separate, independent, but they are one, no gap between. 

So that is the picture of reality you live in. That’s why it’s very difficult to understand the ultimate nature of existence – how you can communicate, how you can touch the truth. Or how the truth comes to your life. We don’t know. But only when your life is really fully alive – it’s work, it’s become one. But still your intellectual sense is very stubborn, so alway analyzing, synthesizing. So in order to refine your consciousness, which is good enough to see the total picture of the functioning process of your life and the truth. So that’s why we do zazen. Doing zazen, and studying the Buddha’s teaching, that is really refining your mind. 

So only when they are fully functioning, at that time it is a state of oneness. 

So that’s why even though why you do zazen, anyway zazen and you must be fully alive. That’s all we have to do. 

And then when the time is ripe, conditions arranged, means when your body and mind are ready to accept that rhythm of the universe and your life. At that time, you can turn your life at 360 degrees, at a moment of time only. That happens in a moment of time only. Sometimes you can catch it immediately. Sometimes you are very impressed by this. You can have a big shock. Sometimes you don’t know when it goes in. Very slowly it sneaks in, sometimes. But for the long range, you understand, but you don’t know when you realize that one. 

Sometimes people really experience a big shock. So various ways to experience that oneness. But whatever experience you have, that experience occurs in the moment of time only. That is a point. That’s why here it says, “With a single stroke he completes it” exactly. When you hit the drum or case, in a moment of time, that is the time and space which is complete, which you can complete something. That is turn over, your life is really turned over, all of a sudden.

So that is “with one stroke he completes it.” 

“... and passes beyond ordinary and holy.” We don’t know how, and also we don’t know [if] it is holy or not. Anyway completely beyond your speculation. Buddha did? Or something holy power turns your life 460 degrees? No way. No, I don’t think so. You did it? No. No one knows. No one knows; you cannot deal with it, but only when your life is really fully alive in a moment of time only, again and again, all of a sudden you can experience religious transformation. 

That is called enlightenment. 

#####

> His slightest word can break things up...

If you experience that one, well, your words come up from ... say... vastness of existence which is silent. So from silence, it comes up. That word is really powerful and helpful for you, for others. So the slightest hit, the slightest word can break things up. 

> ... untying what is bound and releasing what is stuck. 

“What is stuck” means very sticky. “What is bound” is the intellectual ... constraint? But what is stuck means in this case kind of emotional attachment which is very sticky. It’s pretty hard to cut it off. But more or less, you can practice every day. 

When I was in college, in the beginning of a college student’s life, at that time it was very hard for me, but toward the end, I was also a hard time. So one day I confessed how hard my life was, so I said to my teacher about my karma, well, sort of a sentimental feeling. I didn’t cry, but almost cried. But he knew my situation came from kind of a little bit sentimental. So he said immediately, “Katagiri, don’t sit on the chair of your karma.” In other words, don’t enjoy. Don’t enjoy sitting on the chair of your karma. Because I explained how my karma is. Do you understand that?

If you cry yourself, if you feel sad or melanchology, or if you feel sentimental – well, sentimental is okay, romantic is alright, but if you become sentimental, people don’t notice you are enjoying sitting on the chair of sentimental. Do you understand? But in order to understand sentimental, you have to stand up from the chair of the sentimental, and *then* you can understand really, you can be free from. But when you become sentimental, very naturally, we enjoy. We enjoy sitting on the chair of the sentiment. 

The problem is we don’t realize that. So very naturally, you really fall into it, your life becomes just like quicksand of the sentimental. So it’s very difficult to get up from that. 

So that’s why that teacher said, “Katagiri, don’t enjoy sitting on the chair of your karma.” That was a very simple answer, but it was a really strong suggestion for me. I woke up, really. “My goodness!”

So the words, even the simple words, it is very helpful for everyone, if it comes from silence, or vastness of existence.

> As if walking on thin ice or running over sword blades, ...

[That] means when you walk on thin ice, if you stop, you can break the ice, so you can fall into the lake. So you cannot stop, so you have to continue to move. And also it’s as if “running over sword blades”: if you stop walking, you are walking on the sharp blades of the swords, so your legs are cut in two. So you have to continually walk without stopping. 

> ... he sits within the heaps of sound and form, he walks on top of sound and form.

“Sound and form” means this usual human world, created by the six consciousnesses. 

So, we sit within the heaps of sound and form, within the samsaric world, and then you can practice this. How? Just like walking on the thin ice. Continually you should walk. Whatever you feel – scared, or enjoy – you cannot sit on the enjoyment, et cetera. Whatever you feel, you have to just walk there, without stopping. And just running over swords blades. Anyway, you have to walk constantly there. Where? That is in the human world, the samsaric world. This is really good practice for us. 

That’s why here it says, “... he sits within the heaps of sound and form, he walks on top of sound and form.”

So how can you experience religious transformation, ... 360 degree. You have to continue to walk and run on the top of the sharp blades of the sword. 

#### 25:13

> For the moment I leave aside wondrous functioning in all directions. How is it when he leaves that very instant? To test I am citing this old case: look!

Well, it’s very difficult to explain. How is it when he leave that very instant. At the very moment of time only, then that is a place and a time and space which you can turn over your life 360 degrees. “How is it when he leaves that very instant” – how can you explain this? That’s pretty hard. But here is a case, [an] example. That’s why it says, “To test I am citing this old case.”

But “he leaves that very instant” means without being involved in the idea of the very moment of time you can experience religious transformation. Because it is nothing but the practice, continuous practice. Continuous work, continuous running, without stop. This is life. 

So if you leave that moment, that moment always which you are running, which you are walking constantly, it’s very difficult to explain. Of course we can explain, but it’s very difficult. But here is a good example, that’s why this koan gives us an example.

> Ching Ch’ing asked a monk, “What sound is that outside the gate?” The monk said, “The sound of raindrops.”  

This is a very ... honest answer. “What sound is that outside the gate?” And then the monk said, “The sound of raindrops.” 

Well, in the sound of raindrops means not only the sound of raindrops. You can say anything. “What sound is that outside the gate?” Maybe you can say, “The sound of a snake eating a frog.” Or you can say, “The sound of the blooming flowers.” “The sound of morning sunlight.” You can say.

So, in this case, maybe it is the time rain falls. That’s why the monk said, “The sound of raindrops.”

And then Ch’ing said,

> “Sentient beings are inverted. They lose themselves and follow after things.”  

Sentient beings are inverted. So if you hear the sound of the raindrops through your six consciousness, already you miss the chance to know as raindrops really are. In other words, you cannot understand, you missed the chance to understand the truth of raindrops.

In Buddhist psychology, whatever ... your mind works, at least there are five consciousness works always, whatever you may do, wherever you may go. One is *tangibility*; tangibility means communication with the world. Touch. Tangibility is kind of one important pole of a house. When you are born in this world, you can communicate with the world. So your life is just like an important pole of the house, supporting the whole structure of the house. So your presence is very important for us. That is called tangibility; touching. 

Next, *feeling*. Feeling means receiving your world. So several kinds of feeling: a physical pleasant feeling or unpleasant feeling, and mental pleasant feeling or unpleasant feeling, and also mental or physical neutral feelings. This is receiving. When you receive the world, immediately your feeling starts to work. That is several kinds of work, that is physical unpleasant feeling or pleasant feeling, and neutral feeling, mental pleasant or unpleasant feeling. So those ... work. 

And next, perception. So you can create an image of your object in your mind. That is perception. 

And next, the fourth is volition, or will. We you receive, and you can experience feeling, and also next you can create image of your object in your mind, and then next your will or volition works.

Then next, the fifth one is a kind of spontaneous attention. So immediately you pay spontaneous attention to your object.

So those find minds always work, whatever you do. As long as your are alive, they work. Through these five functions of your mind, we can accept, we can understand, we can discriminate, we can separate, we can synthesize, anyway an understanding. 

So already you understand a tape recorder, but that tape recorder is not real tape recorder, because you understand the image of the tape recorder, reflected in your mind. So it’s already a little bit crooked, perverted. 

So individually, if you see the tape recorder, everyone cannot see the tape recorder in the same feeling, same sense, same perceptions. No, you cannot do it. So everyone accepts that tape recorder in different feelings, different sense, different meaning. So very naturally, real tape recorder is completely [kept] away from you. 

So that’s why if you heat the sound of raindrops, it’s already perverted. 

But in Buddhist psychology, Abhidharma, there is still a huge world which is not associated with the function of your mind. Whatever kind of mind works in your daily life, still there is vastness of the world, that is sometimes they make a list of things. It’s not necessary to say everything, but for instance, time, space, direction. And also function
