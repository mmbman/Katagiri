**Katagiri Roshi:** ... the first Ching is exactly C-h-i-n-g, and the C-h-apostrophe-i-n-g. *(He pronounces Ching Ch’ing, in response to a question.)* “Ching Ch’ings Sound of Raindrops.” 

The Pointer: 

> With a single stroke he completes it and passes beyond ordinary and holy. His slightest word can break things up, untying what is bound and releasing what is stuck. As if walking on thin ice or running over sword blades, he sits within the heaps of sound and form, he walks on top of sound and form.
>  
> For the moment I leave aside wondrous functioning in all directions. How is it when he leaves that very instant? To test I am citing this old case: look!

The Case:

> Ching Ch’ing asked a monk, “What sound is that outside the gate?” The monk said, “The sound of raindrops.”  
> Ch’ing said, “Sentient beings are inverted. They lose themselves and follow after things.”  
> The monk said, “What about you, Teacher?”  
> Ch’ing said, “I almost don’t lose myself.”  
> The monk said, “What is the meaning of ‘I almost don’t lose myself’?”  
> Ch’ing said, “Though it still should be easy to express oneself, to say the whole thing has to be difficult.”

(Returning to) the pointer:

> With a single stroke he completes it and passes beyond ordinary and holy. 

This discussion between Ching Ch’ings and the monk about the sound of raindrops. I think in the history of Buddhism... first, I think Buddha in the early period of time, when Buddhism was born, almost right after the Buddha’s death, the image of the Buddha was expressed by a kind of story. You know Jataka stories? It’s very fantastic, Jataka stories: it teaches us the Buddha’s past life (lives), in order to respect how great Buddha’s personality, Buddha’s life, was. In order to admire Buddha’s life, people naturally tried to explain the Buddha through his past like. That is the Jataka stories, the Jataka sutra. 

And with more development of Buddhism, the image of Buddha was represented as not a story, [but] as mountains, rivers, and birds... the sound of raindrops... Spring, butterflies, birds, et cetera. So in the Buddhist scriptures, particularly Zen, I think Zen teachers use the trees, birds, and mountains, skies, and moon, nature, to express buddha nature, and Buddha himself. Or enlightenment, et cetera. Truth. 

And later, in the later period of time, maybe the image of Buddha is represeted as a Buddha statue, picture of buddha, photograph of Buddha, et cetera. So, pretty different expression in the history of Buddhist teaching. 

So about the sound of raindrops... in this case, raindrops is not the usual raindrops, this is the symbol of buddha nature, the symbol of the truth. In order to express, in order to represt the truth, or buddha nature, or Buddha’s personality, the Zen teacher used the sound of the raindrops. 

So the sound of raindrops is not the usual sound of raindrops. Through the usual sound of raindrops you have to have eyes to see deeply what the truth is, through the raindrops. Through the table, through the flowers. That is the point in this case. 

“With a single stroke he completes it and passes beyond ordinary and holy” – I told you, through the table, through the sound of the raindrops, through the flowers, through the sound of a stone hitting the bamboo tree. Or blooming flowers. You can turn... you are all of a sudden impressed by the flower of the plum tree, the sound of the stone hitting the bamboo. This is religious transformation. You cannot know how you can turn your new leaf. You don’t know how you can turn ... 360 degrees of your life. That is not something which occurs through your intellectual understanding. Because between the phenomenal world and between your life and the truth, vastness of existence, there is no gap between. No gap. It’s exactly one... but it’s not “mixed up.” But when you try to understand the relationship between your life and the truth or vastness of existence, universal life, at that time you naturally create a gap between. And then you are interested in the gap. How can you fill up, how can you stop up that gap? In other words, how truth relates or influences your life. Or you are interested in the point how your life connects or touches the truth, vastness of existence or universal life. You’re very interested. But we don’t know. Because actually, no gap.
