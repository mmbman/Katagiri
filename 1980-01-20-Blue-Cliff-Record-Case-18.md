##### 3:05

> Emperor Su Tsung asked National Teacher Hui Chung, “After you die, what will you need?”

This is a common question to a person who ... about to die. What do you want after your death? Because if National Teacher Hui Chung was one of the greatest Zen teachers of those days in China, respected by [Chi?] emperors, in the different ages. So, his disciple and many people expected him something specific, regarless of whether he was alive or he passed away. Anyway, the people really wanted to respect ... after his death. So we wanted to have something. That's why he asked, “What do you need after your death?”

##### 5:00

> The National Teacher said, “Build a seamless monument for me.”[<sup>3</sup>]

A seamless monument is a very common term in Buddhism. If you go to Eiheiji monastery, in front of ... there is a huge lantern by the small pond, where people let go of ... whatever. That is freedom, for ... ... situation ... So that by this pond you have ... lanterns. You know the lanterns in the temple? Not like this, ... lanterns, you can see in picture. ... called seamless lantern. That means that pond is called  ... ... means “be alive”, just let go of...  So for this, you cannot have any exception to ... just let go of it. Seamless means formless. In prajnaparamita, we say no form, no eyes, no ears. So, seamless lanter.

Seamless lantern or seamless monument is not a particular monument or lantern, but this is a picture of life and death. Seamless monument. 

Picture of life ... just life seamless monument, and then at that time you can ... human culture, human ... 

So because ... life, what we can perceive is not based on, filled with pros and cons, successes and failures, ... lots of stuff there. Name: zazen, and Katagiri, and the trees and the suffering, et cetera; life and death, and old age and sickness, et cetera. Lots of stuff in human life. But this is ... those names. Life and death, you call life and death ... pick out those ... completely poicked up... what’s left? What’s left is really important, because this is a quaality of life. Life is already a name you put on. But you have to know the quality of life. You say death, but that death is a name of death you put on it, but you have to know the real quality of death. ... is exactly sitting right now right here means you can’t bring anything, any concept into what to do, so called zazen, or breath, or concentration. Well, nothing. Why do we have even exactly something, in zazen, it’s not really zazen. ... touching the real core, quality of life and death. If you pick out all things, what’s left. 

##### 11:20

That is ... Buddhism always says, emptiness. Emptiness is not nihilistic quality of existence. Quality of existence, so-called emptiness, is really dynamic work. But no one can touch it, because it’s really dynamic. 

##### 12:20

From this point, when you experience success, you feel good, but you cannot stay in success for long, because without human effort you cannot succeed in anythign. So regardless of whether you succeed or not, failure or success, you have to continue to make every possible effort to live if you have a certain vision, constatntly you ahve to ... always.

So strictly speaking, ... success and failure, pros and cons, and then what’s left? Nothing gain, nothing to get in your head. But it is good fighitng, nothing to do... no, I don’t mean this. Nothing, emptiness, dynamic working means full aliveness of your life. So you have to do something from day to day, beyond success and failure. You have to really devote yourself to take care of life. This is seamless life. Seamless life, seamless death. And then at that time, we can really [receive?] so call human culture.

I told you before, culture is not just received from somebody else. “Oh, this is a beautiful culture.” I don’t think this is something you have to do. You should receive the culture from somebody, but culture is not just to receive. You have to light [the candle?] so called culture. That means you have to light, how do you like the candle of human culture? Human culture means individual lanterns also, human cultureu, beautiful cutlure. That beautiful culture your life is - what? Something you have to ...  people can understand, people see it? ... whether people can see or not, real human culture is constantly there. That is seamless human culture. That’s why I told you before, ... quality of life, must be ... by your back ... front.... do you remember? Buddhist teachings with his back. Back means seemless, formless teacing, conscious. 

##### 16:25

... So whoever you are, if you really live in a real life, just like this, people will understand, people can accept how important human life is from you. Not from ... right side, left side, back side ... anyway, seamless, seamless form of your existence, which you have taken care of. 

For instance, when my teacher was alive, I really didn’t understand his way and his life, Zen Buddhism, et cetera. Even though he kept silent, or even though he said something, one word, saying, “get up” - when the people get up, why don’t you get up? At that time I got the big experience, but still I didn’t appreciate it. Because human ... always looking at the front, trying to understand logically and theoretically. If you don’t understand ..., it’s really hard for us to accept. But if you don’t want to acept; that’s okay, it depends on you, that’s up to you. But you cannot always do it in that way. If you take carre of your life just like this, you become a very small scale human being and isolating from the people. And people don’t understand you, people don’t respect you. So very naturally you are isolated from the people, because you cannot live in peace and harmony with all sentient beings.

So finally you have ... I am stupid. Not stupid, but ... come up. 

##### 19:22

Now I really understand, I can really treasure the core of human existence which my teacher had demonstrated while he was alive. 

That means not the logical aspect, not the ... ... his life in failure or his life in success, ... total picture, and you can really feel something. 

So now I really appreciate his life. Whatever he did, whatever he said, I really aprreciate. 

Something which he always told me is not something ... possession of form. success or failure or pros and cons. Of course, you can see, but the more imporatnt of human life is, completely you are there. From his life as a whole, you can really get something. 

That is very common for human beings. When your parents die, when your brothers die, when your sisters die – anyway *after* peoples death, you really feel something. Don’t you think? This is very true. But while they are alive, you’re really ignorant.

Because we are always looking at the front, trying to understand logically, theoretically. That is a very common human style. 

So that’s why the National Teacher said, “Build a seamless monument for me.”

##### 22:08

And then,

> The Emperor said, “Please tell me, Master, what the monument would look like.”[<sup>4</sup>]

This person is a very nice person. Because the National Teacher wants to build up a seamless monument, so what is a seamless monument? So would you tell me what kind of seamless you would want to have?

> The National Teacher was silent for a long time; then he asked, “Do you understand?”[<sup>5</sup>]
> The Emperor said, “I don’t understand.”[<sup>6</sup>]

“dont understand” two meanings. Bodhidharma said also, was asked by Emperor Wu, “Who are you, in front of me?” He said, “I don’t know.”

This is also “I don’t know.” But he knows pretty well. He knows very clearly who he is, becoming one. At taht time there is nothing to dichotomize or contaminate. For instance, when you really do something with your wholeheartedness, cleaning the room, ...., ...., at that time you don’t know who you are, or you don’t know how fast time is going. You don’t care the time, you’re really one. At that time people ask you, “What time is it?” You say, “I don’t know.” But it’s really so late, you know.

[Plaing] Japanese Go, Japanese people like very much playing Go. Go is very wonderful to play, but if you started to do this and you completely forget the time, you’re really devoted into it. Even midnight, you stay late, all night you can stay, just playing Go all night. You don’t feel tired, you don’t feel what time it is, you don’t want anything except [to play] Go. 

So even though someone asks you what time it is, you don’t know. But time is already with you, so you know the time pretty well. But when you becoe really one with time, you don’t know time. When you’re riding an airplane, ... when you become one with the speed of ... you don’t know how fast the airplane goes. All you have to doi is just be there. And then if people are asking you, how far the plane is going, you don’t know. But it’s really fast. 

This is also one meaning of “I don’t know.” You know pretty well, but if you are free from “you know,” you don’t know.

##### 26:32 

So this is all one meaning. If you know pretty well who you are, you cannot say anything, don’t you think so? You say I am enlightened person. Still you create lots of space between you and enlightenment. If you are really great enlightened person .. there is no space to look at objectively. ... you don’t know. 

Just like shaking bottle filled with water. Completely one; at that time you cannot make noise. But if you shake a bottle with a little water, you shake it, your really make noise. That is, you know pretty well how “great” I am, but if you shake the bottle completely filled with water, you don’t know how much [there is]. So no sound. That is really oneness. That is very quiet. But it is really dynamic, and also total manifestation of ... majesty, and improbability. But nothing to say. 

So that means “I don’t know.” Bodhidharma said. Or the other one is, “I don’t know” means completely I don’t know, because I have no idea. People ask me what Buddhism is, what zazen is, you say, “I don’t know.” That is really I don’t know. *[he laughs]* Don’t you think so? 

##### 29:00

If you say “I don’t know,” you cannot get any ... to tell you, or to teach. But if you really know zazen, even though you cannot say, if you really know what zazen is, even though you say “I don’t know,” that “I don’t know” has a really great spirit to teach you, to teach somebody. So, still people feel that point. 

##### 29:41

So that is ... Emperor Wu ... I don’t know which of two. The .... He really didn’t know, or he knows pretty well and is free from he knows, and then he says he doesn’t know. I don’t know. No one knows. *[laughter]* But anyway from this story, Emperor Wu was  not the common people, he was great Zen Buddhism. 

Finally National Teacher was silent for a long time, then he said, “Do you understand?” 

In this book, Shobogenzo ... Four Horses. In this, Dogen Zenjo says such a ... From agama sutra, the Buddha said to assemble monks, there are four kinds of horses. The first kind immediately follows the rider... when surprise and fear at seeing the shadow of the whip. The second does likewise when the whip ... in the air. The third however doesn’t obey his master until after the whip has struck his flesh. The fourth finally doesn’t do so until the whip has reached his very bones. 

Four kinds of horses. I don’t know which of the horses you belong to, but anyway. If the people are ... just like this. 

From this, maybe you understand ... which really runs the moment when he says the shadow of the whip, that is the best horse. In comparison with another horse who doesn’t run until the whip reaches the bone. That is a very common understanding. But that is discrimination. If you understand human life just in common sense like this, you never understand how to live in peace and harmony in the human life. 

In Buddhism, if the ... touches the ... Strictly speaking, you cannot just touch hair, ignoring skin, muscle and bones. Touch yourself here means exactly touch your sking, muscle and bones. Without touching the bones, with the muscles and skin, how can you know? Touch there.

So to touch a hair means completely to touch the whole body. In other words, broadly speaking, in Buddhism, when you do gassho, this gassho is ... to you and to others and to all sentient beings. This is exactly truth. But you dont know, you don’t believe this. 

That’s why ... and Dogen Zenji ... explain the four kinds of horses. Which of the four are best? Do you think the horse who runs the moment you see the shadow of the whip is the best? No, I don’t think so. 

So, four kinds of horses are exactly living in the realm of no discrimination, because touching the hair is exactly touching the skin, muscle and bones, whole body, and then at that time, you can run.

For instance, playing piano, I told you always, you cannot play the piano with just two hands. You have to play the piano with two hands, two feet, two eyes, nose, whole body, composers, and also your past life, and the composers life, the composers feelings, composers heart, all the organs, heart and feelings. And then you can really play. 

So what do you mean, touch the piano? Touchhing the piano is not touching the keys, not touching the ... To touch the piano is to touch all sentient beings. And then at that time, this is called to touch the keys. That is the ... so your presence is not only your presence but simultaneously presence of the whole world. ... At that time, you can really take entire responsibility for you life, with ... That is great. 

### 37:40 

You do zazen, that’s why zazen is not ... for ... your life. That’s why Dogen’s ... is doing zazen for all sentient beings. That is great compassion. Because to touch you is to touch all sentient beings. 

If so, it’s not necessary to ... who controls the whole. He understands ... .... so just let go of any kind of horses, without controlling without getting hit first. ... Of course, you need a whip. We need a whip because when the ... was born, sit .... because Buddha says, ... even cat and dog are buddha. If dogs and cats are buddha, ... his skin, his muscles and other cats. ... says that is common consciousness, but whatever you say doesn’t hit the mark. Anyway you have to understand you as human being, but that human being is really ... strict. Strict is to the path. You have to understand human life for long, long length. 

##### 39:47

If you understand your life for long range, through the past, through the future, you cannot criticize the degree of stupidenes. *[he laughs]* How stupid you are. Because this is karmic life.

Karmic life is completely beyond your speculation, your understanding. Why am I Japanese? I don’t know. Completely, I don’t know. I know pretty well that I am Japanese, because I know my parents and my grandparents; but I don’t know why I am Japanese. Why were you born as American? You don’t know either. You can explain, you know why, but ... is just a speck of dust, because you don’t now. ...

So you have to really understand human life for long range. At that time whatever makes you ... how great you are, that is completely beyond criticism or evaluation, judgement. All you have to do is, just ... accept and take care of that aspect of human life. 

From this point, ... the whip. You need the whip. ... touch ... shall I touch the skin, shall I touch the bone and the muscles. That’s alright. This is not discrimination, because your life as karmic life is something you have to accept totally, beyond criticism and evaluation, because your life is really long. 

If you really undersatnd this karmic life, ... turns into Buddha’s life. You can really accept. And then, accept is not just accept at random. You have to accept and ... take care of your life in positive way. Taht is meaning of a whip.

Or practie ... effort, constatnly. Human energy is a sort of energy, you can keep your life as a Buddha. 

##### 43:30

... There is a story where Dogen Zenji says ... Haven’t you heard how an outsider asked the Buddha, I don’t ask about the spoken, I don’t ask about the unspoken. In other words, completely beyond words or not-words. Karmic life or not karmic life. What is life? 

The outsider – in other words, this means a Brahman – asked the Buddha, “I don’t ask about the...”

*[tape change]*

... seamless monument, if you don’t really attach, if you don’t really dichotomize, that is reall seamless monument for you, right now. That is really teaching from your back. That is teaching kind of from life as a whole – not front, not back, not life or death. As a whole. And if you continually take care of your life just like zazen, you really teach to somebody, even though you don’t say anything. 

So, that is ... this Brahman really wants to know what ... seamless monument is. So the World Honored One remained silent. “Sit down.” The outsider bowed in homage, and [sighed?] in praise. He was really surprised to see the Buddha’s silence, “jsut sit down.” He really attained, he really touched something.

And then he said, “The World Honored One, the greatest ... and great compassion, has dispersed the crowds of my delusion and caused ... ” So after the outsider had left, Ananda asked the Buddha, what did the outsider witness? He said he had gained entry. The World Honored One said, in worldly terms, he’s like a good horse. He goes when he sees the shadow of the whip. 

Peopel often go to the silence for their understand. What is there to grasp. In buddhism, silence is important, but silence itself is not important. If I ... teaching comes from silence. ... Even western philosophers say, life and human existance is really based on silence. 

And then we believe that silence is really truth of human existence. But I don’t think so. Because silence *is* human life, true human life. ... if you believe in some way, you have to always keep silent. How can you keep silent? You cannot stay with the silence constantly. So you have to know the world completely unfolded ... if you keep silent, keep silent. But you have to know that somebody unfolded completely behind this silence. Do you understand? If I sit dow nand do zazen, and then you believe concentration is perfect. ... I don’t think this is the purpose of zazen. The purpose of zazen is not to concentrate on breath, not to face something, not to keep out something, not to escape from, not to have a daydrem, not to count the breaths. If so, zazen is just to sit down without doing? No, it does not mean that. Because we have already ... monkey mind. So you have to ... positive ... have to take care of. That’s why we say .... and then, when you ... so called concentration, with wholeheartedness, there is big world, absolutely unfolded. Name of concentration, name of zazen, practicer, that is zazen Zenji says, total manifestation of whole world. 

That is teaching coming from your back. This is teaching coming from a powerless power, you can get from your practice. Behind the ... behind the effort, there is great power. Effort is not something you can create power, to teach or to understand behind anyway this effort. Behind this effort means the world unfolded totally, beyond name of concentration, name of practicer, name of ... whatever you say. It doesn’t hit the mark. Anyway take off any clothese. And then what’s left? Nothing to say. 

So keep slilent. Keep silent is what? Keep silent is not stumbling toward, it’s really working, which is called zazen. You have to raelly work. 

So that is Buddhist silence. Really silent. Silence totally accepts your life including the whole world. Just like touching a mirror; if you touch a mirror, that means touching the whole world. It is really true, because from where your hair comes? Your hair comes from you? Or from the function of your body? Of course, but that’s still an answer, explanation. Broadly speaking your hair comes from where? Emptiness[?] That’s great. 

That’s why it is important to see the hair, it’s very important. The human hair is making sort of a ... person who gets a Ph.D.. He’s a great ... If you compare with a first grade child. No. ... Well, .. maybe we hve to give a whip until the whip touches the skin and the muscle, anyway. But this is your discrimination. Touching the skin is exactly touching the hair and the whole body. So even though firest child child is great, wonderful person, human being ... should totally acept and respect, that is wht? Nothing to say. 

But right in the middle of silence you have to say something, because this is human life. For instance, right in the middle of suffering, well pain in zazen, can you say something about pain? You cannot say anything about the pain in zazen. But if you keep silent in pain, that means you have to die with the pain? No, you have to be alive. So silence in pain is really aliveness...  .... 

##### 54:47

.... he kept silence and sit down for a while and said, “Do you understand?” The emperor said, “I don’t understand.” And then the National Teacher said, “I have a disciple to whom I have transmitted the Teaching” 

So finally the emperor said, “I don’t know.” But whatever kind of meaning of his answer, it doesn’t amtter. Because there is no way to approach to him. So he said, I haven’t said. So after my death, ... 

##### 55:46

National Teacher said “I have a disciple to whom I have transmitted the Teaching, Tan Yuan, who is well versed in this matter. Please summon him and ask him about it.” After the National Teacher passed on,[<sup>8</sup>] the Emperor summoned Tan Yuan and asked him what the meaning of this was.[<sup>9</sup>] Tan Yuan said,

> South of Hsiang, north of T’an;[<sup>10</sup>]

That means – wherever. 

Life and death is not something limited by name or concept or philosophy or psychology, life is something which exists wherever. Eternal space, enteral time. This is life. 

> – [Hsueh Tou](glossary#setchō-jūken) added the comment, “A single hand does not make random sound.”[<sup>11</sup>]

Well, eternal life, eternal space and time is what? Can you make a sound? No. No matter how long you shake a bottle filled completely with water, you cannot make a sound, because there are not two. Completely one bottle; not bottle and water. That is one hand. 

So one hand cannot make a sound at random. So that is really total picture of life and death, which is called seamless monument, he really wanted to build up.

To build up a seamless monumnet means not for him, for all sentient beings, for the disciples who are still alive ... to the future. You ahve to build a seamless monumnet – not for me, for you! 

GThat’s why Hsueh TOh added the comment, “A single hand does not make random sound.” It’s very simple and clear, and nothing to comment ....

##### 58:54

> In between there’s gold sufficient to a nation.[<sup>12</sup>]

That means slient, nothing to say means something in vain? No, it’s just like gold. Still filled up, completely, filling the whole world. That is the quality, that is the material of the monument. You have to build up a seamless monument with this gold. quality. life. But we believe name of life, that is not quality of life. Quality of life is completely go.d, filling the whole world.

##### 1:00:02

> – Hsueh Tou added the comment, “A rough-hewn staff.”[<sup>13</sup>]

That silence ... gold is not something a person refined it. It is just like rough-hewn staff, directly from the wilderness, which no one has touched. Completely pure and clean; nothing to contaminate. So that’s why Hsueh Tou added the comment, “A rough-hewn staff.”

##### 1:01:10

> Beneath the shadowless tree, the community ferryboat;[<sup>14</sup>]

This is the meaning of [eternal?] time. 

When you do zazen, there is eternal space, which is called all sentient beings. Simultaneously you can touch your skin, muscle; audience, composer, past, present, future – this is touchig the key of the piano. VBut according to time process we don’t understandd ... But even the time process, according to time process, one moment, according to dance, human life is analyzed according to exactly the moment after moemnt. So ini one moment, countless beings exist. That is the most im[portant attitude how we should take toward human life. Because that moment is really wonderful community ferryboat. ... But you don’t believe in that way, but it is most important attitude we should take forward. 

That’s why day by day, in the practice, gassho, and doing zazen, ... are very important. The gassho and zazen and chanting all are seamless monuments, must be seamless monuments. At that time zazen is handed down from generation to generation and religious culture. ... don’t understand. Religious culture ... zazen ... is not only to sit zazen, but you have to light candle of zazen. You have to light. You understand to light – light means you have to be alive, you have to make it alive. You have to animate zazen in your life. That is a culture, human culture.

##### 1:04:14

> – Hsueh Tou added the comment, “The sea is calm, the rivers are clear.”[<sup>15</sup>]

That is really spritual security, so called spirutla security. If you do this on the basis of human existence, ther eis always spiritual security, which is going on constatnly, carried on and on. Concsciously or unconsciosuly. 

That is not always calm. It’s really alive. 

##### 1:04:58

> Within the crystal palace, there’s no one who knows.[<sup>16</sup>]

If you believe the seamless monument of human life and death, and human culture, whatever you say, we believe that is something great, wonderful, which has lots of ... lights coming from the bodies and coming from your spirit. I don’t think so. 

That is really crystal palace, great palace, because it is spiritual security. We always expect in many ways. But if you really get into it, there is no one who knows. “There is no one who knows” means spiritual security which lets go of you yourself as freedom. If you have somebody who knows, you are stuck in this guy or his ... “I know Katagiri.” At that time I’m really stuck in this guy. So who knows? No one knows. “Know one knows” means you know pretty well, but I must be free from one who knows. Because this is the crystal palace, which I am, which you are. That is everybody . 

So if you know, you have to be free from person who knows. That is original nature, so called spiritual security. Spiritual security lets you go free, constatnly. Taht is spirutal security. If there is even slightly somebody or something which knows, that is really ... 

That’s why Tsueh Toh says, “Within the crystal palace, there’s no one who knows.” ... ??? Always there is something we know. Wonderful .... spirit, inspiration ... .... spiritual ... greed ... that’s fine. If that’s make you fun. But is that really the spiritual security your are looking for? No. Because finally you are really stuck in there.

The other day someone came to see me and told about her life, because she was predicted by ... the indian religious person, who was greta. So at that time she was ready to accept that prediction. So recently she started to believe, because these predications came to be true. But not all the predictions he gave; some. That some must be something ... bad. Because peopel ... pay really attention to something unwholesome, bad. But if we are happy, we don’t pay attention, because we are happy. We are really infatuated with happined. That’s why we don’t care...

But if we have really ambivalent conditions, if you are ... you really pay attention to it. Then you create new... pay more careful attention, again and again. Finally, you cannot move an inch. 

Right in the middle of prediction. Prediction is fine, because in a sense it is true, teaching you who you are, or ... astrology ... told you what is your future. Yes it is. But, don’t believe. You should believe this, but, you shoudlnt’ be stuck in there. You should be free from there, from from the thing or prediction. Because this is ... real ... of human life. In other words, still there is a chance you can create your life toward the future anyway, because basically anyway everyone is free. Nothing to limit, nothing to bound your life. Tied up with a certain idea. 

So even though ... prediction ... teach you, telling yo uthe truth of your life.... fine. The truth is still limit of the truth. You have to know behind the truth. Don’t be cheated by the name truth. You have to know the real quality of the truth. Kick out the name of truth of your life, in the future, in the past. That’s fine. But you have to know real qulity. for this, you have to take off the cloths of naming truth, That is really our ... okay?

That’s why Hsueh Tou said, “Within the crystal palace, there’s no one who knows.”

##### 1:12:02

> – Hsueh Tou added the comment, “He has raised it up.”[<sup>17</sup>]

Exactly. Exactly, that is holding, understand of life.
