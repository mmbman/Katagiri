This is an index to where koans from [The Blue Cliff Record](glossary#blue-cliff-record) appear in [Katagiri Roshi's](glossary#katagiri) talks. It only includes talks I have transcribed, and is a work in progress.

Katagiri Roshi usually refers to [*The Blue Cliff Record* translated by Thomas Cleary](books#BCR) (see [Blue Cliff Record: Case1 – Lecture1 (0:00)](1979-11-17-Blue-Cliff-Record-Case-1-Talk-1#000)).
