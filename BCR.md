# The Blue Cliff Record Koan Index

This is an index to where koans from [The Blue Cliff Record](glossary#blue-cliff-record) appear in [Katagiri Roshi's](glossary#katagiri) talks. 

**Note**: This is an early work in progress, and it only includes talks I have transcribed. I will update it as I add new transcripts.
