title: "Miscellaneous Talks"

This is a gathering place for talks that aren’t part of a series and don’t seem to fall into a particular category, other than “Zen Buddhist Teachings.”

##### [Save All Sentient Beings](1980-03-15-Save-All-Sentient-Beings)

Katagiri Roshi explains the meaning of Buddhist terms such as “save all sentient beings” and “all dharmas,” clarifying what *all* means. It may not mean what we usually think. In Buddhism, *all* means something which is closely connected with our individual life. Ultimately, we have to dive into the ocean of karma, which is *samskaras*.

##### [Arts and Buddhism](1983-10-29-Arts-and-Buddhism)

Katagiri Roshi discusses what the true purpose of Buddhism is, which intersects with a discussion of Buddhistic art. *Bendo* means to expend our every possible effort toward *the way*, not for the purpose of satisfying our desires.

##### [Introduction to Buddhism](1985-06-22-Introduction-to-Buddhism)

An alternative title for this talk might have been, “What Is Buddhist Faith?” What does *faith* mean in Buddhism, where the central philosophy is *emptiness*? Buddhist faith is intimacy with total dynamic working. Katagiri Roshi discusses how “the way we should practice within the intimacy between our lives and emptiness” is “to bear up, to enjoy, to desire, and to be limpid and clear.” Along the way, he talks about quarks, and driving on the freeway in Los Angeles. And he answers the question, “What does this have to do with zazen?”
