This is a gathering place for talks that aren’t part of a series and don’t seem to fall into a particular category, other than “Zen Buddhist Teachings.”

##### [Save All Sentient Beings](1980-03-15-Save-All-Sentient-Beings)

Katagiri Roshi explains the meaning of Buddhist terms such as “save all sentient beings” and “all dharmas,” clarifying what *all* means. It may not mean what we usually think. In Buddhism, *all* means something which is closely connected with our individual life. Ultimately, we have to dive into the ocean of karma, which is *samskaras*.

##### [Arts and Buddhism](1983-10-29-Arts-and-Buddhism)

Katagiri Roshi discusses the true purpose of Buddhism, which intersects with a discussion of the arts and their relation to *sunyata* (“emptiness”). Life and death should be seen in terms of the way (*bendo*), not in terms of satisfying our desires.

##### [Introduction to Buddhism](1985-06-22-Introduction-to-Buddhism)

An alternative title for this talk might have been, “What Is Buddhist Faith?” What does *faith* mean in Buddhism, where the central philosophy is *emptiness*? Buddhist faith is intimacy with total dynamic working. Katagiri Roshi discusses how “the way we should practice within the intimacy between our lives and emptiness” is “to bear up, to enjoy, to desire, and to be limpid and clear.” Along the way, he talks about quarks, and driving on the freeway in Los Angeles.

##### [Dogen: Four Points](1987-01-10-Dogen-Four-Points)

Katagiri Roshi explains Zen Master Dogen’s teaching in terms of four points: *realization of impermanence*, *shikantaza*, *liberation in action*, and *the whole works*. This short talk focuses on *realization of impermanence* and the meaning of *shikantaza*: zazen as *practice*.

##### [Devotion: Walking Alone with Open Heart](1988-12-24-Devotion-Walking-Alone-with-Open-Heart)

Katagiri Roshi discusses how and why we should devote ourselves to dharma. He says that in Japanese, devotion is *kie* or *kimyo*, which mean to return to something true or ultimate, which is universal life. Devotion must be practiced in terms of two points: one is that you have to walk alone, realizing the simplest expression of existence, and the other is that you must be compassionate, open to everything. He relates this to Shakyamuni Buddha’s statement that “you should rely on the self; you should rely on the dharma,” and to passages from *Muni Sutta*, *Khaggavisana Sutta*, and *Mettā Sutta*. And he discusses how to deal with problems in the community while standing in the dharma.

##### [Dealing with Death, Dealing with Life](1989-01-07-Dealing-with-Death-Dealing-with-Life)

Katagiri Roshi discusses how we should practice with those who are ill or dying. We have to deeply understand human suffering and pain. There shouldn’t be an expectation that there is a certain way to die; lots of emotions come up, and we should be right there with it. Also, we should practice a feeling of togetherness with those who are ill or dying, because there is no separation between us and them. We need to practice this in our day-to-day lives, or we will not be ready to offer compassion in difficult times. This everyday practice may seem to be small, trifling things, but it is very important for us; it makes our personality mature. It includes expressing emotions in appropriate ways and times, not recklessly. We need oneness, and also oneness needs *us*. We have to receive oneness, and deal with it, and make it alive.
