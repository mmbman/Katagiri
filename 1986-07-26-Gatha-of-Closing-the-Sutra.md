**Katagiri Roshi:** ... [I would like to explain] the *Gatha of Closing the Sutra*. A few minutes ago, Michael O’Neal chanted this [...]: 

> May the merit of this penetrate into each thing in all places, so that we and every sentient being together realize the buddha way.

After lectures, we chant this. Also, [during] the evening service, after chanting the sutra, we offer this *gatha* to the Buddha. 

[...] A *gatha* we chant after a ceremony is called *eko* in Japanese. In Sanskrit, *parinama*. Which means “change,” “alteration.” The second meaning is “ripening.” And also a third meaning is “development”: causing to grow, maturation... this kind of meaning. 

So in Buddhism, the idea of *eko* is pretty important. *Parinama*: transference of merit. 

I think the basic nature of existence is perfectly ripened. Ripeness means ... what would you say... very pure, clean. Nothing to contaminate. So it’s perfect; perfect state of existence. This is the basic nature of existence. So, our basic nature of existence is perfectly ripe, pure, and clean; nothing to contaminate. And this original nature or ultimate nature of existence supports all sentient beings constantly. So from this point, I think whatever we do, I think all doings are going in the realm of ultimate nature of existence, which is extending to the whole universe.

So from this point, your action, your ... in the ceremony, or zazen, in actions, must be very ripe, perfect, clean, and pure. Nothing to contaminate. So if you do it, I think as best as we can, we should do as simply a we can. Without leaving any trace. So when you do gassho, with wholeheartedness just do gassho. Without expecting anything, perfectly your doings, your zazen, your gassho in action must be very ripened, very pure. If a persimmon is perfectly ripe, it falls naturally, apart from branches. So you cannot attach to branch. So very naturally, if your ripe, your doings are perfectly ripe, it falls. In other words, you can let it go.

So nothing to feel regret, or not regret, perfect or not perfect. You just do.

So that’s why after ceremony we chant this eko, means what we have done is transferred to original nature of existence. In other words, let go of our doings, to the nature.

So merit. If you do something we have merit. Even though we don’t see it. If you do something, you have some merit. You can make progress in your practice as far forth as you have done, even a little bit. You can progress. So that is characteristic of human action, so you can get the reward, you can get the result. So if you get the merit, you should give it away to ultimate nature of existence. Because it is very pure and clean. So this is the Buddhistic idea. Always we do for us, for all sentient beings, but always our actions, our doings, must be very clear and pure and clean. Perfectly ripe. So we call eko, parinama. 

So, we chant “may the merit of this penetrate into each thing in all places so that we and every sentient being together can realize the buddha way.” 

This comes from Lotus Sutra, Chapter Seven, the parable of the magic city. This is a very interesting story. 
The parable of the magic city. It says, 

> There were a Buddha named 

in Sanskrit, it’s very complicated, but in English, 

> This is a Buddha named Universal Surpassing Wisdom Tathagata

or literally, Great Pervading Surpassing Wisdom Tathagata. 

Great Pervading means great capability to teach freely, to every living being, any kind of beings. This is Great Pervading Wisdom. 

So this buddha, named, Great Pervading Surpassing Wisdom. This wisdom is really unsurpassed, because wherever he may be, whatever he does, his capability always extends to all sentient beings to help, and to teach. So his wisdom, his knowledge, is really unsurpassed. And also there is he has his own country, named Sambhava. That means Well-Completed. The name of the country is Well-Completed. And also his age, the age where he lives, is named Maha Rupa – Great Form, Great Appearance. 

So there are three things: the Buddha named Great Pervading Surpassing Wisdom Tathagata, and his country, called Sambhava, Well-Completed, and the age in which he lives is called Great Appearance, Maha Rupa.

And also this buddha lived a long, long time ago. So this buddha is one of the past buddhas. So how long, how many years ago? Here it says – very interesting – “since that buddha became extinct, a very long time has passed”. So this Buddha died many, many years ago. 

For instance, what is many years ago [that] this sutra says? For instance, “suppose the earth element in a three thousand great thousand-fold world were by someone grounded into ink powder, and he were to pass through a thousand countries in an eastern direction, and then let fall one drop as long as a grain of dust. Again passing through another thousand countries, again let fall one drop. Suppose he thus proceeds until he has finished the ink powder made of the earth element.” This is called a long, long time ago. That means innumerable, countless period of time ago. You cannot count. 

And then when this buddha attained enlightenment, the radiant light penetrated throughout the world. And then all bodhisattvas, brahmas, deities, demons, all sentient beings who saw this light came to this Tathagata and asked for his preaching, and said to him like this: 

“How good it is to see the buddhas, holy honored ones, who save the world, who can complete the health of the human world to deliver at the living. The always honored of gods and men, out of compassion for the crowds of young ..., can open the doors of the sweet dews, for the extensive relief of all, innumerable kalpas of yore have emptily passed without buddhas. While a world-honored one didn’t appear, darkness is everywhere rained. Thriving ... the three evil states, flourishing ... ashavas. While the heavenly host dwindled, fell into evil estates, not hearing the law from buddhas. If a following improper ways, their bodies, strength, and wisdom, these all ... the way. Because of sinful karma, they lost their joy and joyful thoughts. Fixed in heretical view, unconscious of the rules of goodness, not receiving the correction of the buddhas, they ever fell into evil ways. The Buddha is the eye of the world, and after long ages appears. Through pity for the living, he is revealed in the world, surpassing in his perfect enlightenment. Great is our felicity, and all other beings rejoice as never before. All ... made beautiful through this light. Now we offer the world-honored one, condescend in compassion to accept them.”

Then I think when this Tathagata attained enlightenment, the light gave forth throughout the world, and all sentient beings came across this light, and appreciated it, and rejoiced in the light, and also rejoiced in their life. And then they realized the palaces they live become very beautiful, by light. 

So finally, they say, we will offer this beautiful palace to you. So these palaces are given to the Buddha. And then after this, they say, condescend in compassion to accept them. Then they say, “may this deed of merit extend to all creatures, that we with all the living, may together accomplish the Buddha way.” Exactly the same as this. 

So after offering the beautiful palace, they used to live, is given to Buddha. And then this offering, may this merit penetrate into each thing in all places, so that we and every sentient being together can realize the Buddha way. They chant like this. 

So this eko, this [Gatha of] Closing the [Sutra], comes from this story in the Lotus Sutra. 

And then after this, this Tathagata talked about Four Noble Truths to the audience. This is Chapter Seven.

#### 20:37

So in this gatha we say, “May the merit of this penetrate into each things in all places, so that we and every sentient being together can realize.” So what you have done, the merit of your doing, is giving to all sentient beings. So your doing, your practice, is not just for you. So your practice is given to all sentient beings. Not just for you. 

I think this is very important, and I think in the *Shōbōgenzō* chapter *Shoaku-makusa*, “Good and Bad” (or “Not Doing Wrongs”), there is an old story. One of the Governors in China in ancient times, who was a really great Buddhist, and went to see one of the Zen masters, and discussed about some aspect of Buddhism. And then he asks the Zen master, “What is the essence of Buddhism?” And the Zen master says, “Do not [do] some unwholesome; do something wholesome; purifying your own mind. This is Buddha’s teaching.”

And then, the Governor, named Paichii (Bai Juyi, also Bo Juyi or Po Chü-i, Jp: Haku Kyoi, 772-846), he was governor and also great poet. So he said, “Is it all [of] Buddha’s teaching?” The Zen master (Chōka Dōrin) said, “Yes it is Buddha’s teaching.” And then the Governor says, “Such a teaching is known even by a little three-year-old boy.” In other words, that teaching is not real teaching, because the governor expected something more than that. So the teacher says, “Yes, even a little three-year-old boy knows pretty well; but even an eighty-year-old man cannot practice it.” This is the whole story. 

And then Dōgen Zenji comments on this story, one by one. So he mentions like this. 

Dōgen Zen Master comments on this: “Poor Paichii! What nonsense you are talking about. You have never heard the Buddha’s teachings. Do you know a three year old boy? Do you know the principle prior to incipience of his birth? One who knows a three-year-old boy can also know the Buddha in the Three Worlds. How could one who has never known the Buddhas in the three worlds know a three-year-old boy? Do not believe that you can know a person you have met. Do not believe that you cannot know a person you have never met.” This is a part of the commentary. 

So he first says, “Poor Paichii!” Because Paichii was a great intellectual person, great person. People say he was just like a Zen master, just like Manjushri and Avalokiteshvara. That means, everyone knows him very well. He was a very well-known person. 

Dōgen Zenji says, “You are a well-known person, and you command respect from all people, but still you don’t know what the Buddha’s teaching was.” Because he accepted that teaching mentioned by Zen teachers, “Do not do something unwholesome, do something wholesome, purify your mind. This is Buddha’s teaching.” So he accepted this teaching in terms of moral sense, the usual sense. So that’s why Dōgen-zenji says, “Poor Paichii! What nonsense are you talking about? You have never heard the Buddha’s teachings.” Buddha’s teaching is not something like that, [which] you have understood. 

So do you know a three-year-old boy? I think, even though you see a three-year-old boy, how much can you understand a baby or a three-year-old boy? Even though you have met? Even though he is present in front of you, how much do you understand? We don’t understand exactly. So that’s why he said, “Do you know a three-year-old boy?” Because a three-year-old boy speaks of his life in the universal perspective. Something more than you have understood. So you don’t know exactly what he is speaking of. So that’s why if you see a baby, you are really moved by the presence of the baby. He doesn’t say anything, but the adults are really impressed by baby’s presence. Or a three-year-old boy’s. Because they are speaking of something more than what you have seen or heard. 

So that’s why Dōgen-zenji mentions, “Do you know a three-year-old boy? Do you know the principle prior to the incipience of his birth?” Because, do you know the real three-year-old boy – not after his birth, do you know the principle before his birth?

Well, before his birth, there must be something. Do you know who you are? You know who you are after birth, but do you know about you before your birth, before your parents’ birth? We don’t know. 

So that’s why if we say, “I understand you,” or living together, and then in order to know each other pretty well, let’s live together – this idea is pretty good, but I don’t know how much you understand. No. You never understand exactly. 

After living together a couple of years, and then you decide, “Let’s get married, because we know pretty well each other.” But a couple of years later after marriage, you divorce, you know, pretty easily. So how much do you understand [about] people, and about you yourself? 

So that’s why Dōgen Zenji says, “Do you know the principle prior to incipience of his birth?” Is that correct? “Incipience of his birth?”

“One who knows a three-year-old boy can also know the Buddhas in the Three Worlds.” If you know somebody exactly, including the principle prior to the incipience of peoples’ birth, you can know. You can know all buddhas in the three worlds. That means you can know everyone. 

If you master one thing, you can know everything. If you know perfectly ... whatever it is: sports, or whatever. If you know one thing perfectly, you can know human life very well. 

But usually, people don’t master perfectly one thing. All people become a butterfly, jumping here and there. Doing one thing, he doesn’t like, and then moving away and get something else. So always at that time you don’t know, you don’t know what human life is.

So that’s here it says, “One who knows a three-year-old boy can also know the buddhas in the three worlds.”

“How could one who has never known the buddhas in the three worlds know a three-year-old boy?” If you don’t the whole human world, trees, birds, pebbles, oceans, lakes .... if you don’t know all beings in nature, you don’t know who you are. You cannot know yourself.

So if you want to know nature, all sentient beings in nature, I think you have to know who you are. If you don’t know who your are, I think you cannot know anything.

That’s why Zen Buddhism says, “To learn Buddhism is to learn the self.”

#### 34:07

And also here it says, “Do not believe that you can know a person you have met. Do not believe that you cannot know a person you have never met.” 

So even though you meet every day, you practice together, but don’t believe that we know everyone pretty well, [just] because we meet every day. Don’t believe in that way. 

But also he says, “Do not believe that you cannot know a person you have never met.” That means, even though you never see anything, behind the trees and hundred years ago, we don’t know what’s going on around the trees a hundred years ago, because it was a time before I was born. But at that time, even though you cannot see it, don’t believe that you cannot know it. You can know it. 

And also, “One who knows a speck of dust can also know the whole world.” Even a speck of dust. If you know pretty well, you can know the whole world.

“One who penetrates one dharma, one thing, can penetrate the myriad, myriad dharmas.” That means the whole world. 

I think people are very greedy, in a sense. If you become a Buddhist, you always try to know everything – including philosophy, psychology, and medicines, you want to know everything. If you are really genuinely smart, you can do it. But if you are very common person, I think you don’t have any capability to master everything. So, don’t hesitate to master one thing. That’s is great. 

So if you really master only one [thing], zazen, I think you can understand what human emotion is. You can really understand human emotion, the human heart, human intellect, human instinct. You can understand nature pretty well. And also you can understand what time is. You can know the shortest period of time, even though you don’t have a computer. 

So, I think if you master thoroughly one thing, you can know all. But people are very greedy, that’s why people always doing something halfway, always. Biting just a little bit [off], and then move away. 

That’s why it says, “One who penetrates one dharma can penetrate the myriad dharmas.”

#### 37:59

“One who doesn’t penetrate the myriad dharmas cannot penetrate one dharma.” 

So I think you have to accept not only the present, but the past and future. You should penetrate. Penetrate means you should really accept, open yourself. Your heart must be open perfectly, and to accept past, present, future. And then, you can know who you are, in the present. 

And also, if you want to know what the past is, what the future is, you should penetrate the present thoroughly, and then you can know. But most people try to know the past and future, ignoring the present. It’s impossible to know that. 

“When you learn the penetration by virtue of thoroughgoing penetration to see the myriad dharmas is to see one dharma. To learn a speck of dust never fails to learn the whole world.” So, when you learn the penetration – penetration means really master, you have to master thoroughly – you are versed in something, only one thing. At that time, your action, your practice is always right in the middle of thoroughgoing penetration. Just like a spinning top. If a top spins perfectly, top becomes calm. If you become you as you are, you don’t know who you are. If you concentrate on something perfectly, you don’t know the time and space. When you really devote yourself to play gambling [games], et cetera, you completely forget time and space, and you yourself, the suffering and the pain. So I think that in order to master something, your practice must be right in the midst of thoroughgoing penetration. At that time, learning one thing never fails to learn all sentient beings. You can learn, naturally. 

So that’s why in this gatha we say, “May the merit of this penetrate into each thing in all places.” In all places means past, present, future; the whole universe. “So that we and every sentient being together can accomplish the buddha way.” So I think we should accept ourselves, we should do something with all sentient beings. Which you cannot see, but what you cannot see doesn’t mean not to exist; it exists. So you can know it. In order to know it, I think you should penetrate one thing perfectly, with wholeheartedness. At that time, right in the midst of perfect concentration, oneness appears. Within the oneness, all sentient beings come into one screen, so called oneness. Where you are, naturally.

That’s why if you practice day by day with wholeheartedness, that practice makes the progress in your practice. So naturally, it makes you a master, a professional. But if you don’t, it’s very difficult to master one thing. So if you want to know master, if you want to know the past the [future] of your life, anyway you have to really penetrate one thing in the present. Then, naturally, it extends into the past, present, future. So very naturally, that practice guides you to [mastery], guides you to achieve the final goal of what you have to do. 

So that’s why in Buddhism we always chant, “with all sentient beings.” So we should do something with all sentient beings. And we should give away the merit of what you have practiced, to all sentient beings. 

Do you have questions? 

#### 43:59

**Question:** Hojo-san? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** *Hai*.

**Question:** I realize that I thought I was putting my whole heart into something, but I wasn’t, and I don’t know... how do you know?

**Katagiri Roshi:** Well, with your [six] senses, it’s very difficult to know. But if you do it, if think there must ... it manifests itself naturally. That’s why all you have to do is you really have to devote yourself to practice every day. If you want to master dance, as a dancer, you have to practice. Completely beyond your emotional situation, beyond your like or dislike, every day you have to practice. And then, this practice, if you think of the future, we don’t know the guarantee, whether you become a great dancer or not. But all you have to do is, every day you have to practice like this.

And then, it’s progress, naturally. 

And Dōgen-zenji mentions one more thing. He says, it’s a very interesting point, he says like this: 

> Practice thoroughgoing penetration in action.

Is that okay? “Thoroughgoing penetration in action” means samadhi. You really jump into the water, and then swim. Swim is to thoroughgoing penetration in action, with water, the skies, your body, six senses, all become one. That is thorough penetration, okay? That is a practice. We call [it] practice, or we say “undefiled practice.” 

So he says, “If you do this, it is good in the beginning, in the middle, in the end.” Always good. But you don’t see it. 

And also he says, “So that it manifests itself as form, ... being, wholeness ... of the practice.” This is the section Ten Factors of Being in the Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sutra means the presence of the microphone manifests as the ten factors of being. Ten factors. That means form, own-being, and also wholeness, and force, function, cause, conditions, effect, retribution, and ultimateness. So form means external form, and own-being means internal quality. Microphone as internal quality, microphone as external form, microphone as wholeness, which means one wholeness of form, and own-being. External form [and] internal form become one. This is wholeness. So you cannot separate internal form or internal quality and external form. You cannot separate them, because both [are] working together. This is wholeness. 

And force, force means the potential capacity. Potential capacity means human beings or microphone have their own capacity, which we cannot believe, something more than we believe. Particularly human capacity is something more than you evaluate. If you practice zazen, you can see how great your capacity is. So that is the force; everyone has [this]. It’s great force; we have energies, life force. Whatever it is, it’s always alive. This is force. 

And function, which means manifested process. Function means microphone always manifests itself as a form. 

So cause, direct cause which makes a thing originate and act. Everything has a cause of its own, because it exists. 

And also condition, which means indirect cause which facilitates the process of direct cause. So, if you put the seeds, naturally indirect cause comes together and to facilitate development of cause. So the seeds grow. Because around the cause, there is warmness, sunshine, human effort, humidity, many things there. This is conditions. 

And effect. Very naturally, it grows and fruits. 

And also retribution. Because it helps human beings, and all other beings. So that retribution in ultimateness means from the number one, number two, all are coherently interconnected [with] each other.

So that is the ultimate nature of existence, ultimate nature of microphone. So ultimate nature of microphone includes from number one, number two, and number nice. Form, own-being, wholeness, force, function, cause, condition, effect, retribution. Those things, working together. Completely beyond your speculation. 

So if you do gassho, there is wonderful energies there. External form, internal quality, and oneness. Those are oneness. So very naturally if you express a form, I think that form manifests, that form means to express internal quality. In other words, you accept, you mature, make your internal situation of existence mature, if it becomes mature, naturally it comes up. And then that is a form. 

So if you see the form, very naturally there is internal quality. So form means not merely form you see. 

So this kind of a form is already internal quality there. Table, microphone, whatever. And also, there are force, fantastic, enormous energy there. To live; whatever it is. Those things are always working together. So if you do gassho, very naturally you can see those energies. But it’s really there. That’s why if you do this, very naturally, you develop. Your personality, character, is ripened, naturally. 

Are there any other questions? 

#### 53:44

**Question:** Hojo-san, what you would you say is functionally happening when this chant is recited?

**Katagiri Roshi:** Function? 

**Same person:** Right. What I’m thinking about is, in terms of, I mean there’s a conceptual level...

**Katagiri Roshi:** Mm-hmm.

**Same person:** ... in which you could say it’s a very fine concept, to transfer the merit. But then now I’m wondering specifically about what happens functionality when this is recited. What is the intention here? For a particular experience to happen to in the person reciting it? 

Do you understand my question at all? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Mmmm... Yeah, I feel a little bit, but not exactly. 

**Same person:** Yeah, that’s what I feel too. *[Laughter.]*

One thing you could say here... In other words... I guess I’m looking at this from the point of a view of a practice that someone does, who’s chanting this. I’m not talking about it from the point of view of the philosophy expressed in the eko, but as an activity that someone does, chanting this eko, or reciting it mentally. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Reciting a dharani or short verse, whatever. Okay. 

**Same person:** So functionally, what happens? ...

**Katagiri Roshi:** I think... it’s very difficult to... There are not so much opportunity to know what happened when you do exactly. The opportunity is very rare to know it. Okay? But beyond whether you know or you cannot know, I think functioning is always functioning. And also you can always experience something. 

But sometimes the great opportunity is very rare to touch your heart. So always pass by, always pass by. But some day, something touches your heart. Because always we pass by, pass by experiencing. That’s why finally some day we can touch the heart.

So whatever you feel, chanting the verse, chanting the name of the Avalokiteshvara, ... with a gassho, at that time, your six senses don’t accept, doesn’t know. So your six senses always pass by. Or sometimes six sense stop, and watching: “What are you doing? What does it mean?” ... always. Or, continually you ask what it is, what does it mean, what did you get from that chanting, et cetera. Finally you don’t get any answers, so your consciousness just passes by, because many consciousnesses coming up, one after another, always, so you cannot stay with one consciousness. 

So conscious world is pretty busy. That’s why sooner or later, you have to pass by. But conscious doesn’t accept it, but if you do it, you can experience it. You do it. That’s why I say, you can make a progress as far forth as you have done. Exactly it touches your heart. But consciousness doesn’t accept, doesn’t know. But we should wait for the time to know. 

That’s why Dōgen-zenji says, even though you don’t see something, I think, don’t believe that you cannot see it. Still you can see what you cannot see. 

So that is our practice. Within the practice, a huge world is there. In the sphere of thoroughgoing practice, there are some you can see, there are some you cannot see. But you should accept *both*. 

Is that alright? 

**Same person:** So that seems to suggest that you accept practice as it is given to you. 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Mm-hmm. Yes.

**Same person:** So, is there any area where there is choice in the practice? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** Well, choice is already the conscious world. But thoroughgoing practice is not in the realm of *alternative*. Because if you participate in the alternative world, very naturally you have to involve in many things, philosophy, psychology, et cetera. And the material world. Or, you have to participate in the spiritual world. You have to research the mind, what’s going on there. So very naturally you start to research what’s going on. But the more you research or analyze your consciousness, what’s going on in the process of zazen, whatever you do – it makes you confused, very much. Because you don’t know what’s going on there. Because sometimes *many* things happen. Okay?

So the more you study intellectually, or if you try to find some space you can make a choice of, in order to know something in a better way – I think it seems to be good, but I think finally you are very confused, because no conclusions. So final thing which you come to the end is, right now, right here, how you live. That’s it. How you live, now. In peace, in harmony... steadfast. How do you *be* present? That’s the question. This is the final goal that you have to do. 

But people don’t believe this, because it is too simple.

But Buddhism always talks about this, but Buddhist people are very interested in always analysis of what’s going on. *[He laughs.]* Analyses of how to live right now, instead of *just live* right now, in peace and harmony. People don’t do it. Always analysis, or analyzing what ... we should do it, right now, right here. Analyze. This is the teaching of Buddhism. Always teaching psychologically, philosophically, Buddhism always offers us, presents us like this. So finally we forget how to live right now. 

So I think there is completely no alternative there. If you are exactly present right now, right here, without any alternative, and then all things come in to. Okay? In your life. And then, gradually, you can know a little bit what the alternative is. So you can make a choice. 

Is that alright? 

**Same person:** Well, what was that very last point? 

**Katagiri Roshi:** *[Laughs.]*

After making a choice, by the alternative sense. And then, you try to find the best way how to live. You cannot do it. First, you have to really do how to live, right now, right here, constantly. And then from that, alternative coming up. Flower blooms. Spring comes, and the whole world becomes warm, the whole world becomes spring. And *then* the flower blooms, okay? But human beings are always interested in the flower blooming, analysis of flowers, trees, and spring, et cetera, completely separately. We don’t believe oneness of spring and blooming flowers. 

So I think we should... how to live right here, right now, it means we have to take care of human life in the realm of oneness, merging of the spring and blooming flowers, simultaneously. And then, you can see the flower blooming, and you can accept the full spring, naturally. And then, you can make a sentence: “spring comes, and flower blooms.” Like this.

Because, before you make a sentence, already here is the oneness. Including your life, the tree’s life, flower’s life. Already exist simultaneously in the realm of oneness. Merging of the spring and flowers. Then all we have to do is accept it and live there. That means, how to live, right now. Trees does in that way; that’s why flower blooms. Trees exist as they are. 

But we do the reverse, you know? Always analyzing, synthesizing, and then try to find the perfect place. *[He laughs.]* And then let’s get into [it]. No. It’s analysis. It’s still dualistic; separation.
